experience   -pron- also believe that the good acquisition target be growth company rather than distressed asset and that spacs that be too large can encounter challenge in find a viable target that s appropriate in size   -pron- ultimately believe that spacs can be a fast   cheap   and easy avenue to become a public company than traditional ipo   but also face -pron- own unique challenge      as an institutional investor in recent deal such as at sea spa operator onespaworld holdings limited and payment company repay holdings corporation   mr   greenberg note that spacs offer distinct advantage over traditional ipo   include the ability to take a large position early on at a reasonable price   baron have play an especially active role in spac deal   recently invest in a private placement alongside the spac transaction that take repay holding public   mr   greenberg say -pron- be supportive of the private placement because -pron- help the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrant   greatly reduce potential dilution   -pron- note that the amount of warrant attach to spac ipo continue to fall as sponsor gain credibility and initial buyer do not need as much incentive to invest      story continue     mr   heyer bring perspective as both the ceo of two recent spac and a veteran business executive with decade of experience   -pron- believe that spac ipo be get large and there be scope for a broad range of acquisition target   but -pron- will remain critical to have a top notch operator   a financial expert and a business plan that do not depend on too many promise   mr   heyers late deal be to bring onespaworld public as ceo of haymaker acquisition corp   the health and wellness company   which operate spa aboard major cruise line such as carnival corporation and royal caribbean cruises ltd    have be one of the most successful spac combination in recent year   with the share trade nearly 70   high   and more for those who keep

be currently search for another acquisition target      phil denning   partner and co head of icrs special situation group   say that spac deal be likely to expand into new industry such as real

acquisition   ltd     and simply good foods company   conyers park acquisition corp    mr   denning attribute much of the recent success in spacs to the presence of well regarded private equity firm that remain shareholder after deal close and take board seat to stay on as advisor   -pron- also point out that spacs benefit from regulation that allow company to communicate very clearly with investor   give guidance for metric such as revenue and ebitda   something that s not allow with traditional ipo      the complete interview with each of the four roundtable participant can be find below              elliott smith   partner at winston    strawn llp     successful spac ne transaction advisor with spac deal make experience   often the good acquisition target be growth company rather than distressed asset   and while some spac ipo have approach a billion dollar   huge spac can encounter challenge in find a viable target that s appropriate in size   that s accord to elliott smith   partner at winston    strawn llp   which have advise client in spac transaction include new frontier corporation   netfin acquisition corp    willscot corporation   target hospitality   and limbach holdings   mr   smith also say that spacs can be a fast   cheap   and easy avenue to become a public company than traditional ipo   but also face -pron- own unique challenge   the full interview be below      elliott m   smith focus -pron- practice on corporate and security law   elliott advise client on a wide variety of capital market transactional matter   include ipo   follow on offering and private placement of debt and equity security   elliott have particular experience represent spac and -pron- sponsor team in ipo and back end business combination   elliott also advise public company client on corporate governance matter and compliance with the federal security law      ipo edge   how have the warrant feature on spac evolve and where do -pron- see -pron- go      mr   smith   way back in the 1990s   spac issue unit consist of one share and two warrant   one of which be strike in the money   mean the strike price be below the per unit ipo price   the in the money warrant function like an immediate capital raise follow the closing of a business combination   but create a lot of dilution to stockholder which put pressure on the stock price   in the 2000   spac ipo unit evolve to typically include one in the money warrant   towards the end of that cycle   around 2008   spac start issue unit with one share and one warrant which be strike out of the money      these day   spacs issue unit in -pron- ipo for   10 00   and the unit include a share and a warrant   or a fraction of warrant    the warrant have an exercise price of   11 50 per share   some repeat sponsor team or sponsor affiliate with well known private equity fund be able to leverage -pron- deal make track record in order to reduce the number of warrant issue as part of the unit to one half or even one third of a warrant   by reduce the warrant coverage   i e    the number of share issuable upon exercise of all the warrant    these sponsor can market -pron- spac as more attractive vehicle to target company and investor as compare to other spacs that have more warrant outstanding   since the former represent less potential dilution to stockholder upon completion of the business combination      the warrant be a necessary sweetener in order to bring investor into a spacs ipo   but can be unattractive to potential investor in the stock later on after a business combination because of the overhang   over the year spacs have try to mitigate this by eliminate or clean up the warrant at the time of the business combination or shortly thereafter   usually through amendment to the warrant agreement that effectively convert the warrant into cash and or share   in term of the future   warrant will likely always be part of a spacs ipo unit in one form or another   and -pron- do not see spac unit include less than one third of a warrant anytime soon      ipo edge   how do -pron- convince investor to take few warrant with -pron- ipo share      mr   smith   -pron- really a function of investor regard for the quality of the sponsor team and -pron- track record and the investor perception of -pron- ability to find a good target business and complete a business combination   top tier sponsor team that generate a lot of investor interest in -pron- ipo can offer less favorable term   i e    less warrant    first time sponsor team rarely can get away with include less than a full warrant in -pron- spac unit   and when the market slow down   even repeat sponsor will sweeten -pron- ipo with additional warrant coverage in order to get the ipo sell      ipo edge   what be the key ingredient in get a spac ipo to work      mr   smith   frankly   in recent year -pron- have see a lot of first time sponsor team able to complete ipo   which make -pron- look like -pron- not too difficult to raise a spac if the sponsor be willing to provide favorable term to ipo investor   such as overfund the trust account or provide significant warrant coverage      that say   -pron- have see some ipo downsize or get pull due to investor skepticism of team that come in to spacs who have not be involve in public deal or growth equity transaction before   like distressed asset investor   or even successful executive who want to do a spac because -pron- like the look of the potential return but do not have much of a track record for deal make   the spac product be really best suited to growth equity story where the right combination of a savvy sponsor and a solid target business generate investor interest   distressed asset and value transaction have generally not fare so well with spacs      ipo edge   some spac have recently raise several hundred million dollar in -pron- ipo   can -pron- keep grow   what be the remain issue      mr   smith   in the past few year the size of spac ipo have increase   in some instance to nearly a billion dollar   but oddly enough there be challenge with big spac   generally   in order to mitigate the dilution from the founder share and warrant   a target business should be 3 4x the value of the spacs trust account   find a target business with valuation of   2   billion can be challenge for spac   company that size often do not need some of the thing a spac offer and can just go do a traditional ipo if desire   so the pool of target company can be small for big spac and -pron- have have some sponsor team ask whether -pron- possible to reduce a spacs size after the ipo   which be not really possible   as a result   depend on the industry in which a spac be focused   -pron- see repeat sponsor opt to raise spac in the   200   400 million range for maximum flexibility to look for a target 3 4x -pron- size   or sometimes large   if need   spac can scale up for large deal by raise additional capital at the time of the business combination      ipo edge   what kind of advantage do combination with spacs have over traditional ipo      mr   smith   -pron- can be fast   easy   and often cheap to go public through a spac than a traditional ipo   the traditional ipo process typically take 9 18 month   a spac business combination can get do in four month      with spacs   there s great flexibility regard deal structure   marketing material and communication with investor   target seller can take more cash off the table than be otherwise possible in a traditional ipo   spac marketing material can include projection   which be rare for ipo   there be also flexibility on timing   in an ipo   if the market be not there   the deal often will need to be pull and the company be back to square one   with spacs   the transaction term can be re cut to be more favorable to investor   additional capital can be bring in through a pipe or debt financing if need   and these change can be make in real time during the marketing process right up until the closing   in an ipo   those kind of change would need to be push through a form s 1 and would likely delay the sec review process   so that s another advantage for spac      one potential downside of all that flexibility with spacs be that sponsor and target can get deal do even if the transaction be not well receive by the market   that can lead to real challenge for the post close company   if too many public investor redeem at the time of the business combination   the stock will be thinly trade which can make -pron- hard to raise additional capital   -pron- can be challenge for post spac company to attract institution to invest in the secondary market if there be low trading volume in the companys stock      another thing to remember be that with a traditional ipo   the company be typically sell a minority stake in the company to the public   so the potential to be oversubscribed can be high   in a traditional ipo   the offering size can be calibrate to investor demand and the underwriter can ensure there be healthy aftermarket trading in the stock   with a spac   particularly the large one   sponsor have to turn over all the outstanding stock of the spac   which can soak up all the demand in the market make for choppy trading follow the close      ipo edge   what about limitation on spac and can -pron- be improve      mr   smith   the product -pron- be inherently flexible to accommodate all type of transaction   -pron- really about the sponsor team and the kind of target business that -pron- br to the market   if a spac do not bring a good target business to -pron- shareholder   then -pron- do not matter what the warrant coverage be or if the founder be give up some of -pron- founder share   public stockholder will redeem -pron- share and the stock price be go to suffer   on the other hand   -pron- have see spac that have a full warrant do a deal that be well receive and -pron- be able to withstand the overhang issue and create value for investor post close   so -pron- really a function of the quality of the transaction   as well as the target management team ability to execute on -pron- growth plan      that say   there be headwind for spac   one be perception   people continue to view spac as high risk   unfortunately   there be several example of deal that have go south after close   or people remember 2008 when several spac liquidate with no deal   unfortunately   with each business combination that get do and the stock price tank   -pron- a ding on the spac product   which be not really right but -pron- about the perception      some think that spac have a tendency to overpay when time be run out for -pron- and -pron- ne to find a deal   there s probably some truth to that   but again   if a sponsor team and target companys seller understand the product and the process and be focus on position the company to perform post close   then -pron- think those negative factor can be overcome      lastly   -pron- have hear some sponsor lament that -pron- bank do not show up for -pron- to market the business combination with the same energy compare to a traditional ipo   that may be because of how the deferred underwriting fee get allocate within the bank   and so there probably be room for improvement there that would help back end deal get execute successfully              cliff greenberg   senior vice president and portfolio manager at baron funds     spac can offer distinct advantage to institutional investor over traditional ipo   include the ability to take a large position early on at a reasonable price   that s accord to cliff greenberg   svp and portfolio manager at baron funds   which have invest in a number of recent spac company include at sea spa operator onespaworld   ticker   osw   and payment company repay holdings   ticker   rpay    baron have play an especially active role in spac deal   recently invest in a private placement alongside the spac transaction that take repay holding public   mr   greenberg be supportive of the private placement because -pron- help the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrant   greatly reduce potential dilution   -pron- note that the amount of warrant attach to spac ipo continue to fall as sponsor gain credibility and initial buyer do not need as much incentive to invest      cliff greenberg be the portfolio manager of baron small cap fund   -pron- invest in small sized u s   company with significant growth potential   investment include fall angel with strong long term franchise that have disappoint investor   and special situation where lack of investor awareness create opportunity   mr   greenberg have 35 year of invest experience   include 22 year at baron funds      ipo edge   -pron- fund be instrumental in the process of repay go public through a spac   with baron fund participate in a private placement that help extinguish 75   of the warrant in the deal   how do -pron- view that situation      mr   greenberg   repay have enough money to close the deal   but -pron- advise -pron- to take a little more to immediately buy the warrant   the warrant be dilutive and add confusion to the capital structure   -pron- also prefer that -pron- run with a little less leverage and have more capital to pursue accretive acquisition      ipo edge   spac have be raise large and large amount of money   what s -pron- view on invest in a spac at the time of ipo      mr   greenberg   -pron- do not like to invest in blind pool   -pron- invest in company   so -pron- approach be to wait until the spac identify a target and then decide      sometimes   ill put more money in if -pron- ne -pron- like -pron- do with repay   in other case   ill just go out and buy spac share in the market as -pron- do with clarivate      ipo edge   what do -pron- like about spac compare with ipo      mr   greenberg   -pron- can get size with a spac   in a regular ipo   -pron- may get   5 million or   10 million in the allocation   but then the stock may jump   and -pron- will not want to buy any more since -pron- too expensive   -pron- be often not able to establish a full position at a reasonable price      a big advantage with a spac be that -pron- can invest more capital upfront at what -pron- believe be a reasonable price      another advantage be there be more disclosure and more time to do due diligence   -pron- can learn more about a spacs acquisition target   see projection   and communicate with management   -pron- take advantage of the ability to meet these company and get to know -pron- well before invest      ipo edge   what s contribute to the success of spacs over time      mr   greenberg   there have be an evolution   these use to be   20    50    100 million raise   -pron- be acquire flaky company and there be a big risk that the deal would not get approve   also excess compensation be go to sponsor who do not play a role in the acquire company      now   -pron- have   300    400    500 million raise   the sponsor be play a very significant role in the future of the company and be more reasonably compensate for -pron- role      ipo edge   get back to the repay deal   what role do -pron- think warrant will play go forward      mr   greenberg   warrant complicate financial structure and be dilutive   there use to be two warrant issue per share   then one   -pron- have have deal do with less than one warrant and there be some in the market now with a quarter of a warrant   which be a favorable development for new long term investor      investor be not demand as many goody upfront as -pron- be in the past   institutional buyer do not need as much incentive      -pron- a positive that repay be able to retire a good portion of the warrant that be issue upon approval of the deal   -pron- believe this will be emulate go forward and be a major positive      steven heyer   chief executive officer and executive chairman of haymaker acquisition corp   ii     spac ipo be get large and there be scope for a broad range of acquisition target   but -pron- will remain critical to have a top notch operator   a financial expert and a business plan that do not depend on too many promise   that s accord to steven heyer   a veteran business executive who bring onespaworld holdings   ticker   osw   public as ceo of haymaker acquisition corp   the health and wellness company   which operate spa aboard major cruise line such as carnival and royal caribbean   have be one of the most successful spac combination in recent year   with the share trade nearly 70   high   and more for those who keep warrant   since the merger be announce   steven heyer and -pron- brother andrew heyer   who be president of haymaker   have subsequently raise   400 million for haymaker acquisition corp   ii   which be currently search for another acquisition target   the full interview be below      steven heyer be chief executive officer and executive chairman of haymaker acquisition corp   ii   -pron- be also lead director of onespaworld holdings and serve as a director of lazard ltd and lazard group   mr   heyer have over 40 year of experience in the consumer and consumer related product and service industry lead a range of company and brand   -pron- have apply -pron- leadership and analytical skill in a variety of leadership position across diverse industry group   include broadcast medium   consumer product   along with hotel and leisure company   mr   heyer be the chief executive officer of starwood hotels    resorts worldwide and president and chief operate officer of the coca cola company   -pron- also be president and chief operate officer of turner broadcasting system   inc    and a member of aol time warners operating committee   among other role   -pron- be an advisor and director to   and investor in   several private company   include startup and turnaround      ipo edge   what type of leadership quality be most important in a successful spac      mr   heyer   the most successful spac should have a mix of an operator who can see the potential in a business and someone with the financial mind need to craft a deal   -pron- really enjoy work with andy on haymaker and be do the same thing with haymaker ii   -pron- have come to love -pron- even more      ipo edge   what kind of company make a good spac target      mr   heyer   -pron- look for a good business that have both growth and free cash flow   -pron- should be differentiate from the rest of the market with a wide moat around the business   onespaworld have all of those feature and -pron- be able to get a deal do with a fabulous company   -pron- have almost no redemption and great enthusiasm for the transaction      ipo edge   what be the reason to do a spac versus a traditional ipo      mr   heyer   if the owner want to take significant money off the table immediately   a spac be good   -pron- also an opportunity for the owner to roll some of the investment to participate in the upside of a well perform stock      however   for a spac to succeed   -pron- ne trust and motivation on both side   that s how -pron- get a friendly   fast negotiation with onespaworld      ipo edge   be there a size limitation for spac ipo   what s help -pron- get big      mr   heyer   -pron- raise   400 million for haymaker ii but -pron- could be a billion dollar   the issue be that -pron- be probably look for a middle market deal   so -pron- do not need that much in the spac ipo   -pron- be not go to raise   5 billion      with a more successful track record   -pron- can attract investor who want to bet on -pron- team before the target be know      ipo edge   how have spac be perceive over the year      mr   heyer   if -pron- go back 20 year   spac be a dirty word   the reason be that people be use -pron- to line -pron- pocket   -pron- be be bad steward   even recently   -pron- have a handful of investor who have a knee jerk negative reaction to a spac because of that history   but with more successful deal   attitude be change   -pron- evolve from be a niche vehicle to become a real asset class      ipo edge   -pron- talk about cash flow   could a spac deal be do with a fast grow company that s not yet profitable      mr   heyer   -pron- would do -pron- if the growth story be compelling enough and the potential for meaningful profit creation be clear   the expectation need to be that the business can float on -pron- own and do not hinge on a dozen promise or flawless integration   at some point -pron- stretch credibility      phil denning   partner   icr inc      spac deal be likely to expand into new industry such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get   that s accord to phil denning   partner and co head of icrs special situation group   icr have advise on dozen of spac transaction   include onespaworld   haymaker acquisition corp     repay holdings   thunder bridge acquisition   ltd     and simply good foods company   conyers park acquisition corp    mr   denning attribute much of the recent success in spacs to the presence of well regarded private equity firm that remain shareholder after deal close and take board seat to stay on as advisor   -pron- also point out that spacs benefit from regulation that allow company to communicate very clearly with investor   give guidance for metric such as revenue and ebitda   something that s not allow with traditional ipo   the full interview be below      ipo edge   what have be the main driver of the success of spacs in the last several month      mr   denning   one key feature of many successful deal have be the presence of a well regarded private equity firm that have elect to keep a significant stake in the company after -pron- go public   -pron- not only send the message that the private equity firm believe in the business   but can be helpful as the company plot -pron- strategy move forward   -pron- see that with both onespaworld   which have l catterton as a shareholder and repay   which have corsair capital as a shareholder   the role of the private equity firm be generally to advise in the form of one or more board director   but -pron- can also go with informal advisory role or even more formal   such as an executive position create      there have also be an element of creativity in recent deal that make -pron- succeed   the repay deal would have close without the pipe investor   but -pron- additional capital make the term even better because of the dilution that be eliminate   -pron- think that the flexible nature of the product have foster creative thinking   which have lead to success      ipo edge   warrant coverage have decrease in many recent deal   with some as low as   per share   do -pron- believe that the warrant feature be likely to keep shrink or do some deal ne -pron-      mr   denning   the warrant can be a great incentive to get investor into a spac ipo   especially with a team that have a lot of potential but not a proven track record   there be investor out there who really just buy into a deal to get the warrant and have no intention of keep the share   and that s fine   because -pron- help get the cash raise   but the idea be to attract investor who believe enough in a management team that -pron- want to stick with the spac share and wind up own the target company      -pron- will probably always need some warrant feature to keep investor incentiviz   after all   if -pron- be go to let -pron- cash sit in a trust account and just earn minimal interest   -pron- ne a carrot      there will be deal with very small fraction of a warrant   those be go to be the spacs whose leadership have very strong track record   for those new to the game   a full warrant per share be probably go to remain the norm      ipo edge   do -pron- expect spacs to get even large in the next few year      mr   denning   -pron- actually think that spac under a billion dollar be the ideal size   if -pron- get much big the company be probably best suited to go the typical ipo route      the reason why spac may do so well at the current size be that there s plethora of middle market target company own by private equity   many of those private equity firm be in a difficult position because the company be not an ideal fit for an ipo   mean -pron- can only rally be sell to a strategic or another private equity firm   so spac have create an entirely new exit path      and spac be more appealing than a straight sale because many private equity owner want to participate in further upside   if -pron- sell the company to another firm   -pron- obviously can not do that      ipo edge   what be the key advantage to go public via a spac rather than a traditional ipo      mr   denning   one major advantage -pron- have observe relate to disclosure   with a spac   -pron- relatively easy to communicate a target companys growth plan once the deal be announce   -pron- be able to show the investment community specific target for metric such as revenue and ebitda that -pron- can not with a traditional ipo   that take a lot of guesswork out of the equation for potential investor      another advantage from the perspective of a company owner be the ability to sell a large stake but also remain a significant holder   with an ipo   -pron- be really only sell a sliver of the company at the time of the deal      spac can also happen much more quickly   if -pron- raise money and find a target right away   a deal can be do in a matter of month   the ipo process be much more long and arduous      ipo edge   be there specific industry that be best suit for spac      mr   denning   there have be a lot of success with consumer and consumer relate deal   look back to hostess brands and more recently to onespaworld   but -pron- think there be plenty of scope to grow in different industry   just recently -pron- have a real estate spac deal announce with broadmark   which be merge with trinity merger corp    ticker   tmcx    -pron- would expect sponsor to get

real time data will be a key value proposition for all use case   segment   and solution     market lead company be rapidly integrated big datum technology with iot infrastructure     the big datum market consist of infrastructure provider   datum center   datum as a service provider   and other vendor   solution for manage unstructured datum be evolve beyond system align towards primarily human generate datum   such as social networking   message   and browse habit   towards increasingly great emphasis upon machine generate datum find across many industry vertical          for example   manufacturing and healthcare be anticipate to create massive amount of datum that may be render useful only through advanced analytic and various artificial intelligence   ai   technology such as machine learning and cognitive computing   the long term prospect for these technology be that -pron- will become embed in many different other technology and provide autonomous decision make on behalf of human   both directly   and indirectly through many process   product   and service          emerging network and system such as iot and edge computing will generate substantial amount of unstructured datum   which will present both technical challenge and market opportunity for operate company and -pron- vendor   emerge big datum tool such as open api much be implement to facilitate datum capture and processing with the ability to perform localize processing and decision make          big datum solution provider dynamic be evolve almost as much as the data management technology -pron-   while some company rely upon proprietary solution   many lead company such as hortonworks and cloudera offer product and service primarily base on open source apache hadoop technology   one important distinction between market leader be collaboration vs   competition   for example   cloudera compete with ibm   microsoft   and other in data science and ai whereas hortonworks partner with these company          in term of data management and analytic technology   the big datum industry be experience profound change across the entire stack include infrastructure   security   analytic   and the application layer   the data service industry as a whole be shift from host base network topology to cloud base   datum centric architecture   thereby create enormous challenge and opportunity for transition and secure datum system   in concert with this shift   big datum infrastructure will require strategic governance and framework for optimize security          advanced analytic provide the ability to make raw datum meaningful and useful as information for decision make purpose   ai enhance the ability for big datum analytic and iot platform to provide value to each of these market segment   the use of ai for decision making in iot and datum analytic will be crucial for efficient and effective decision make   especially in the area of stream datum and real time analytic associate with edge computing network          the ability to capture stream datum   determine valuable attribute   and make decision in real time will add an entirely new dimension to service logic   in many case   the datum -pron-   and actionable information will be the service   however   real time data be anticipate to become a highly valuable aspect of all solution as a determinant of user behavior   application effectiveness   and an identifier of new and enhance mobile wireless and or iot relate apps and service          augmented reality   ar    virtual reality   vr    and mixed reality   mr   be perhaps best know as datum intensive immersive technology that require high bandwidth for operation   one of the least evaluate opportunity be the market opportunity associate with visualize datum and information in ar   vr   and mr environment   much of this data will be unstructured   require big datum analytic tool to process   categorize   and display in a meaningful manner   this will allow the end user to visualize and utilize information in way previously inconceivable          in addition   lead data management company be develop tool for improved general datum visualization   facilitate improved information interpretation and decision make   couple with ai and cognitive computing   the field of advanced datum visualization and analytic know as augment analytic be transform otherwise useless datum into highly valuable and actionable smart datum   often enable dynamic decision make that may positively impact business operation as process   transaction   and other event occur   much of this smart data will be monetize in a data as a service approach by enterprise thank to lead big datum service provider solution          additional topic

  -pron- may know someone who toss a few thousand buck into share of beyond meat during this amazing run   -pron- cnbc editor tell -pron- about a millennial co worker who tell -pron- about a personal

 and the plant base protein burger craze be trend   cannabis stock tilray be a good recent example   -pron- share be over   200 last september   now tilray share be roughly   40   the fall have be as spectacular as the rise   put on full display the great fool theory   that -pron- be possible to make money by buy security   whether or not -pron- be overvalue   because there will always be someone willing to pay a high price when -pron- sell -pron-   fundamental like earning and revenue be never part of the evaluation process   people be buy on the early gain and the hype that the company would somehow play a major role in the future of mankind   the lesson in tilray s comedown   market price usually catch up with the fundamental and not the other way around   if give enough time   let -pron- make one thing clear   tilray have do okay   -pron- go public at   17   and -pron- first trade open around   23   at   40 today that be still a healthy gain for investor   but only for long term investor who never expect the   200 share price to be hit within a year when -pron- buy in the first place    the stock market be a buyer beware environment   and -pron- ne to do -pron- homework   look at a post ipo stock chart that have skyrocket do not count as research    the tough thing about judge a hot stock be that the metric -pron- investor use to judge these be temporarily suspend   -pron- may be familiar with ratio like p e   price to earning ratio    p s ratio   price to sale ratio   and profit margin   but when a stock jump so much and so quickly that -pron- own ratio can t keep pace with -pron-   -pron- typically mean that the stock be go up on non financial catalyst   what could these be   investor euphoria   extreme optimism   and crazy high expectation that fundamental to match win t be far behind    momentum vs   fundamental   -pron- would never say a company that isn t make money yet be a company investor have to avoid   that would have rule out some of the great ipo of the technology era   but when a stock rapidly ascend for more than a few day   -pron- be consider a   momentum   play   or   momo   if -pron- want to use wall street lingo   stock price be generally ahead or behind the fundamental of the underlie company   which be why stock go up and down in the first place   but momentum stock general outdistance the stock price by such large degree that when -pron- turn back toward the company s fundamental   -pron- cause devastating loss for the johnny come lately investor   in the near term   when what be call the   lock up   period for company insider end   put -pron- share out on the open market add to what have be a limited supply of beyond meat share   and that can pressure the stock price   there also could be an ipo of plant base protein competitor impossible burger   which could pull current beyond meat investor into the new hot trade   the only way to avoid this   in -pron- experience   be to be in stock whose price isn t too far above fundamental   if -pron- typical food company have a p e ratio under 15 and bynd be melt up without any earning   -pron- be a sign   not a guarantee   that be go to reach the end of investor enthusiasm and come back down to earth   food stock   which be part of the consumer staple sector   typically trade at low valuation than that of the overall market due to those exhibit less earning growth   want to look up beyond meat s price to earning ratio   -pron- can t   because a company that have no earning yet can t have a p e ratio   same for tilray   price to sale ratio on tilray be about 65 time sale   beyond meat be trade at about 45 time sale   compare that to some of the large consumer and fast food company   coca cola   6 7 time sale    kellogg   1 4    unilever

teacher and writer   jim like to focus on contrarian aspect of the railroad industry    today   freight railroading have the opportunity to use two business process to support good customer rail freight service   improve safety and generate high return for railroad investor   the senior management of north american railroad can integrate the benefit of precision schedule railroading   psr   with the robust new private communication network and two   to four meter accuracy of positive train control   ptc   technology    psr seek to improve return on investment with cargo delivery that be more   truck like   in term of reliability   the initial psr result have be financial in nature   shareholder   rather than freight customer   be receive the early psr benefit in the form of high

percent or high range since psr be implement widely    how can precision schedule railroad improve even more   the answer be in the roll out of the ptc safety device system    the digital age business hypothesis be that psr and ptc can support each other    the simple message be that the solution to good precision like scheduling of freight car could be satisfied use the precise   gp like   feature of ptc for train and crew dispatch    when congress pass the federal law that mandate ptc   the rail safety improvement act of 2008    -pron- want a train control system design for a minimum level of

wrong position that could cause a crash into freight car on siding adjacent to warehouse or industrial plant   that be the minimal expect functionality of ptc    to be blunt   the railroad have collectively fail almost entirely to implement ptc   on october 29   2015   the positive train control enforcement and implementation act of 2015   ptcei act   be sign into law to extend the original statutory deadline for full implementation of ptc system from december 31   2015   to december 31   2018   the ptcei act also establish six criterion that a railroad must meet in order to qualify for

do that    now -pron- can    with the ptc navigation aid and a robust private railroad communication system integrate into ptc   railroad can now develop such digital software application    to date   only a few railroad   like bnsf   have signal to -pron- customer and investor that -pron- be committed to both the safety and the improved train and carload movement aspect offer by ptc    the holy grail like mission of psr have be to create   then monitor and execute rail carload freight movement use a carload trip plan   the north american railroad have be chase that goal for about three decade    the ptc network of gps constant position reporting of train on the rail industry s private radio network be the miss part    leader like bnsf s ceo matt rose and fra s administrator ron batory be on record as define this advanced next generation ptc version two as an accuracy enabler    at this time   traditional train dispatching efficiency be only about two third to three quarter effective accord to zeta tech associates inc study and other source    typical location information when a train be in a long signal block   perhaps 10 to more than 20 mile long   can be compute with ptc to exact head end and rear end location within six to 12 foot of track    that accuracy improvement can increase the number of train move along an otherwise restrict train per day section of railroad   the improvement with software advance can be in the 20 percent or good range    the possible improved rail yard to rail yard movement and arrival of train at the next yard or customer delivery point can also be improve   the target for carload freight deliver to a track side at a plant or warehouse be 85 to 95 percent on time as originally schedule in a rail car s trip plan   not exactly truck beat performance   however   -pron- be a huge improvement for freight customer who must suffer with today s 50 to 60 percent on time percentage    what be the key component of ptc that will improve train and carload movement that be different than the use of gp in trucking    the critical component of a railroad ptc system be   the on board engineer s computer   the private communication digital network   the central dispatcher s computer console   the back office datum warehouse for ptc   read write   action   the way side track switch   open or closed   sensor operate   and the continuous gp   read   and transmission    railroad win t ne to use cell phone or public cell network to communicate in real and continuous time with train    writing and testing software to integrate thing like rail car weight from automatic equipment identification   aei   use radio frequency technology into brake algorithms and test rail car trip plan be go to take some time   early technical result may still be six month or more away    the technical delivery of good performance may not come from engineer or marketing folk   -pron- be more likely that system integrator in the information technology department will create these new digital application package    ironically   the gps enabler in system come from a federally mandate   10 billion capital investment in ptc   this amount equate to a decade or more of railroad   typical research and development program   which be generally fund at 1 percent of revenue    in summary   rail freight could see a 20 to 33 percent improvement in on time customer arrival service level   this be still not   truck like    but -pron- be much good than today   railroad car cycle time may improve by 20 to 30 percent    therefore   ptc may cause an unexpected commercial utility of gps datum that could pay huge dividend for railroad and -pron- customer   in other word   shipper and freight rail car owner could see a huge productivity gain    this be a benefit that be long overdue   image source from pixabay   want more content like this   click here to subscribe   permalink

peninsula hong kong in 1928   be differentiate from the majority of hotel operator in three key aspect    firstly   hsh operate a single hotel in each city   while most hotel operator prefer to operate multiple hotel in a city to extract revenue and cost synergy   hsh target to be the top hotel in every city -pron- operate in   by operate a single hotel in the city   hsh send a clear signal to both competitor and hotel guest that -pron- have put in the maximum amount of effort and resource to make -pron- hotel the good among peer in the location    secondly   hsh only have one hotel brand   in contrast with the multi brand strategy that a lot of hotel operator adopt   the prevailing view among ceo   management consultant and investment analyst be that a multi brand strategy deter new entrant with entry level   firewall   brand   improve profit margin with premium   up scale brand and capture the full industry profit pool with multi tier brand target at every customer segment    but the reality be that a multi brand strategy dilute brand image   as savvy consumer eventually find out which company be behind any individual brand   hsh understand this very well   so both the company and -pron- single hotel brand   the peninsula   be synonymous with luxury hospitality precisely because of this insistence on a single brand strategy    thirdly   hsh own all of the hotel -pron- operate   while an asset light strategy focus on hotel management be the prevail trend among hotel operator   -pron- own a majority stake   50   or high stake   in eight of -pron- 10 hotel   with a 20   interest in the peninsula beverly hills and the peninsula paris hotel    the negative associate with a hotel ownership strategy be obvious   such as low profit margin   e g   hotel

most significant revenue contributor   account for 22   of the company s 1h2019 top line   the weak performance for the peninsula hong kong be attribute to a high base in 1h2018 due to incremental

earlier   -pron- don t get political in this show   but this issue seem to be get a little political   doesn t -pron-   in -pron- opinion   there s two side what -pron- re see happen with juul and the vap crisis   -pron- can put -pron-   here in the united states   the first one revolve around health issue   this be a move target that change every day   -pron- think   as of yesterday   10 people

-pron- s really unclear what s cause these issue   now   there s lot of theory out there   whether -pron- be vitamin e or black market drug   the vape -pron-   all of these   the government s flounder right now   the regulation that -pron- see come out on the federal level   at least   have be target toward flavored juul pen   this be really different because -pron- s not the flavored juul pen that be cause the health crisis that -pron- re see right now   -pron- s vape in general   but   the flavored juul pen be target toward kid   so -pron- have these two regulation come out   one say    -pron- ne to prevent these device from get in the hand of kid   and flavor appeal to kid    and one say    wait   be these device actually kill people   do -pron- need to do something on a federal level to get rid of -pron- entirely     so   this propose merger between altria and philip morris     -pron- s a remerge   the company be combine back in 2008 before be spin off   the fact that that fall through   -pron- think   be a testament to the fact that philip morris still have a relatively stable international tobacco business   altria   at this point   see decline tobacco sale in the united states and a potentially devastating investment into the vape company juul   so -pron- s not great right now    greer   let s talk about that   when -pron- look at altria   the stock   share and lose around a third of -pron- value over the last 12 month   the stock be down over the last five year   if in five year from now   altria have outperform the stock market   -pron- s do much good than expectation   what happen    flippen   -pron- don t think that s go to happen      greer   -pron- s a thought exercise   work with -pron-    flippen    laugh   altria s core business be decline   altria have some interesting investment into thing like edible nicotine   let s pretend for a second that edible nicotine take off   that could maybe save the company   -pron- re much small investment than the   13 billion -pron- put into vape   though   so   -pron- would require vape   all of the report come out say that -pron- s cause illness and death   need to be debunked   but -pron- d also expect   these small investment in thing like edible nicotine would need to start to pay off    greer   ok   and -pron- want to ask -pron- one more question   -pron- follow the cannabis industry    flippen    laugh   -pron- s be a fun month for -pron-    greer   when -pron- look at all of the vaping news   and the fact   as -pron- mention   this be a dynamic story   -pron- don t know what s behind these death and these health concern exactly but when -pron- look at the vaping story   what do -pron- mean for the cannabis industry    flippen   -pron- mean a lot   virtually every cannabis company out there have some exposure to vape   if not directly   the main way that people consume cannabis be through vap   what -pron- make -pron- think about the industry be   long term this will eventually blow over   but -pron- get really excited about the extraction industry   the company in the cannabis space that be actually work on the scientific process of extract cannabinoid from the marijuana plant   that allow -pron- to put -pron- into thing that don t require vape to be use     topical   edible   drinkable   whatev that may be   -pron- make -pron- really bullish about that sector of the industry    but as -pron- say many a time   this be an extremely volatile   hard industry to be in right now    greer   let s close with some big news from beyond meat   share of beyond meat up more than 10   at the time of -pron- tap on news that mcdonald s will test a beyond meat burger in canada   the burger   as -pron- mention earlier   will be call plt   plant   lettuce   tomato   -pron- kind of like that   -pron- can talk about that   -pron- ll be sell in 28 restaurant around canada start september 30th   -pron- s a 12 week trial   only a few month   share of mcdonald s up only slightly on the news   emily   -pron- m a mcdonald s shareholder   be -pron- the only one excited about the plt    flippen   -pron- know -pron- m personally excited   while andy may be on -pron- peloton bike get a good workout      cross    laugh   -pron- m excited    flippen   well   -pron- may be up in ontario sit at a mcdonald s do what -pron- do good     eat burger   as a new vegetarian   -pron- m personally excited about this   maybe mcdonald s shareholder aren t rejoice as much as beyond meat s shareholder may be   -pron- still think this be a strategic move for mcdonald s   -pron- re just test -pron-   as -pron- mention   very early stage   -pron- will say   -pron- think part of the reason why -pron- re not see the rally at mcdonald s   mcdonald s be a challenging business in the sense that -pron- s virtually all franchise own   -pron- ve have issue in the past in get -pron- franchisee on board with company improvement   now   do -pron- think franchisee be go to turn -pron- nose to fake meat product   probably not   but -pron- be just earlier this year   a month or two ago   -pron- be send letter to mcdonald s corporate office   say    -pron- ne a chicken burger    mcdonald s wasn t quick to jump on that   but -pron- re be relatively quick to jump on the fake meat or meat alternative market   -pron- m bullish on the fact that -pron- may be able to roll this out internationally   here in the u s   and allow -pron- to try -pron-    cross   yeah   -pron- ve talk about this     if -pron- think about how the market will be evolve over the next 5   10   15   20 year   beyond meat whether -pron- s a health option or not   just the fact that -pron- s an alternative   franchisee   mcdonald s   -pron- have to drive -pron- same store -pron- sale   and -pron- have to get more and more people come into -pron- restaurant   if -pron- have an opportunity to offer something that s maybe a little bit differentiate   test -pron- out in the market   see how -pron- go   and   like emily mention   if -pron- s great   roll -pron- out   come down here   get on -pron- peloton   have a little plt    greer   -pron- just roll off the tongue   plt    cross   name aside   -pron- think -pron- s encourage to see a company mcdonald s at least test this out   other be do -pron-   -pron- get to be competitive   -pron- ll see how -pron- all play out for the franchisee    greer   -pron- want to talk beyond meat   -pron- s value around   9 billion   the stock up around 600   since -pron- ipoed in may     in may   people   be there a beyond meat bubble    flippen   -pron- see a beyond meat bubble      greer   -pron- s down a little   but be there still a beyond meat bubble    flippen   -pron- gut want to say yes   the valuation on -pron- for the sale   -pron- look absolutely insane   but then -pron- think about -pron-   and -pron- think about the way that -pron- re   in -pron- opinion   revolutionize a lot of this space   and -pron- s easy for -pron- to say     like -pron- say   as a new vegetarian   -pron- appreciate the work that -pron- re do    greer   be -pron- a flexitarian    flippen   well   -pron- don t feel like -pron- re target vegetarian   -pron- don t feel like -pron- re target people who eliminate meat   -pron- think -pron- re target flexitarian   people who be just try to consume less meat   and that s a huge market   if -pron- do believe that that s a genuinely big market   then -pron- make that valuation look more reasonable   personally   -pron- m not sure the way to get to the flexitarian be to name burger   plant   lettuce   tomato burger    that s not appeal to -pron-   but   mcdonald s may prove -pron- wrong    cross   burger king be do the impossible whopper   that to -pron- sound much more attractive    flippen   beyond fried chicken   too   plt   without understand what the p stand for    greer   people don t want to eat plant    cross   no   people like plant   well   not everybody    flippen   flexitarians want plant    cross   well   to the beyond meat bubble   clearly there be   -pron- think there still be   -pron- m not rush to buy into the stock   even though -pron- love the market opportunity and the way -pron- re go about that   -pron- will say   -pron- be negative on beyond meat sandwich before -pron- come public   -pron- have -pron-   -pron- do not like -pron-   -pron- try -pron- again maybe two week ago and -pron- have to say   -pron- be pretty good   -pron- like   -pron- be good   -pron- m a little bit more excited about how -pron- and other be go to evolve that space and serve a different     flexitarian   vegetarian   whatev -pron- may be   and like -pron- say   over the next 20 year   the market will be move that way   -pron- just think there s too much excitement around the stock   too much excitement around the business   let -pron- die down   -pron- ve already see a little bit of that   the whole ipo market have pull back   -pron- just think -pron- s still a little bit too much froth   too much sauce on that patty right now    flippen   should -pron- stop talk about -pron-   the more -pron- talk about beyond meat   -pron- find -pron- more bullish every time   every single time -pron- come back to marketfoolery there s some new thing for beyond meat   the first time -pron- cover -pron-   eh   but the more -pron- learn about -pron-      cross   -pron- win t be the only one    flippen   that s true   in -pron- opinion   the impossible burger be far superior to beyond meat    cross   -pron- too   -pron- like the impossible a lot    greer   -pron- m go to defend the plt one more time   and here -pron- be   ready   plt   remind -pron- of blt   and when -pron- think blt   -pron- think bacon   -pron- love bacon   so -pron- love the plt   -pron- s the

- Seeking Alpha,investing in and trade the 2x leveraged mreit etns   in -pron- first seek alpha article publish on june 21   2013   federal reserve actually prop up interest rate   what this mean for mreits   -pron- set forth a proposition that   contrary to the widely hold belief that the federal reserve be artificially depress interest rate   -pron- be actually prevent -pron- from fall even more than -pron- then very low level   additionally   as describe in -pron- july 11   2013   seek alpha article   a depression with benefit   the macro case for mreits   -pron- premise be that government policy shift the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class result in much more fund be available for investment relative to productive us for those investable fund   that tend to put downward pressure on interest rate    these two article be the basis for -pron- view that interest rate would be low and for long   than be the then current consensus   this be -pron- macroeconomic rationale for invest in ubs etracs monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn   morl     the only 2x leveraged mreit etn in existence at that time   -pron- logic be that   if the primary risk associate with agency mreits be interest rate risk   then the good environment for invest in mreits would be for interest rate to be low than the market be predict    since -pron- first article be publish on june 21   2013   the total return from morl have be 147 48   though to september 27   2019   assume reinvestment of dividend   this be an annualiz return of 15 55   over that 6 27 year period   thus   morl outperform the s p 500 index   spy   which have a respectable total return of 111 23   over the same period   that be an annualiz return of 12 56   over that 6 27 year period   again assume reinvestment of dividend    morl and later   the ubs etracs monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn series b   mrrl   and the credit suisse x links monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn   reml   have be the primary instrument by which -pron- have attempt to utilize -pron- long term macroeconomic interest rate outlook to manage a portfolio constrain to only include security with 15    current yield    mrrl be essentially an identical twin to morl   reml be base on the ftse nareit all mortgage capped index of mreits   that s the same index use by the ishare mortgage real estate capped etf   rem    as can be see in the tables -pron- and ii below   the index that reml be base on be a slightly different index of mreits   than that upon which mrrl and morl be base   which be the mvis us mortgage reits index   thus   -pron- have use reml as a somewhat interchangeable substitute for mrrl and morl    until september 6   2018   morl and mrrl usually trade very close to each other and to -pron- net indicative   asset   value   which be identical for both   the price relationship between morl and mrrl change after september 6   2018   ubs then announce that -pron- would no longer issue any new share of morl   while typically call   share    etn be actually note   the price of mrrl have continue to closely track net asset value since that announcement   however   morl begin trade far above mrrl   and the net asset value of both    the spread between morl and mrrl eventually widen out to   0 97 on september 17   2018    this enormous spread prompt -pron- article   sell morl   buy mrrl which include       just because morl can possibly trade at a significant premium to net asset value do not mean that -pron- should   this be especially true since the identical twin mrrl be still available at very close to net asset value   there may be some sort of a short squeeze occur in morl   these be dangerous to participate in from either side   however   some short term trader may want to get involve   for investor who own high yield 2x leveraged etn for the very high current yield   if -pron- be make a new purchase   mrrl be a good buy than morl at present price   those that own morl may want to take advantage of the historic spread and sell morl and use the proceed to buy mrrl      the spread between morl and mrrl narrow dramatically soon after the article appear on seek alpha   the spread have bounce around since then   with morl generally trade high than mrrl   the chart below show the morl    mrrl spread for the period after september 6   2018   on june 26   2019   the spread close at an all time high of   1 45   this deviation of morl from mrrl be good thought of as a deviation of morl from -pron- net indicative   asset   value   since mrrl be be create and can be redeem by professional at net indicative   asset   value   mrrl always trade very close to morl and mrrl s net indicative   asset   value   the deviation of morl from net indicative   asset   value also drive the spread between morl and reml discuss in reml yields more than morl   but trade -pron- can be tricky    as can be see from the chart above   the morl    mrrl spread be now near the midpoint of where -pron- have be since september 7   2018   that spread be not the only one involve 2x leveraged etn   various arbitrage opportunity exist in the 2x leveraged etn sector   morl and etracs monthly pay 2x leverage u s   small cap high dividend etn   smhd   at time trade far above -pron- respective net indicative   asset   value   generally   new purchaser should avoid morl and smhd   in favor of mrrl and ubs etracs monthly pay 2xleverag us small cap high dividend etn series b   smhb    2x leveraged monthly pay etn that be base on the same index as morl and smhd   respectively   the index upon which smhb and smhd be base   the solactive us small cap high dividend index   contain a fair number of mreits that be also in the index upon morl   mrrl   and reml be base   thus   smhb and smhd could be a way to achieve high yield from mreits as well    regard smhb and smhd   -pron- should be note that -pron- be more volatile than morl   mrrl   and reml   even though smhb have more than double the number of component of the other 2x leverage etn   this seem to be the nature of some of the component in the solactive us small cap high dividend index   upon which smhb be base   as be discuss in   prospect for the double digit yield etn      an issue with most passive investment base on portfolio of component   which include most etn and etf   be that -pron- may include individual security that -pron- normally would not proverbially   touch with a ten foot pole    this seem to be a significant factor with smhb   common stock with very high dividend yield be   in many case   very distressed company   the large component in the solactive us small cap high dividend index   upon which smhb be base   be realogy holdings corp   rlgy    which have decline by 66   in the last 52 week   signet jewelers ltd   sig   be the second large component and have decline by 73   in the last 52 week   both of those company have some well known problem   the conclusion from smhb s volatility and return statistic during the period be that individual idiosyncratic risk associate with specific issue in an index can undo   in term of risk reduction   some of the benefit of diversification   this do not mean that smhb be a bad investment   per se   however   those who use smhb to achieve -pron- high current yield should be aware of the relatively high volatility associate with -pron-   -pron- be possible that if the last 52 week have much high economic activity the distressed company in the index upon which smhb be base could have outperform and thus smhb would have be the good performing of the 2x leveraged etn      holder of morl and smhd should consider when to switch to mrrl   reml   and shmb   sell morl or smhd and use the proceed to buy mrrl   reml   and shmb will usually result in an immediate increase in current yield   however   wait for the spread to be even more favorable could be even more advantageous   this suggest that not switch -pron- entire position at any one time may be a good course of action    more sophisticated trader may try to trade both way when the spread deviate from the mean by close to two standard deviation   likewise   trader may want to play the spread between morl and smhb as discuss in the most bullish thing for a 2x leverage high yield etn   holder of 2x leveraged etn have usually experience a windfall when the sponsor cease sale of newly create note   and a twin 2x leveraged etn   base on the identical index   exist   holder of such 2x leveraged etn should recognize that a potential windfall exist and consider what strategy -pron- will employ to take advantage of the potential windfall   -pron- should be keep in mind that the windfall will disappear   if the old 2x leveraged etn be hold long enough   since   at some point   all 2x leveraged etn will be only worth above -pron- respective net indicative   asset   value   this will be when -pron- be redeem   either prior to maturity or at maturity    one consideration be that -pron- be unlikely that 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn will pay -pron-   25 face value at maturity   -pron- will pay whatever the net indicative   asset   value be at the maturity date   that be not as scary as -pron- may sound    as be explain in   apply net present values and internal rate of return to 2x leverage etn yield more than 20         that the net indicative   asset   value and dividend from a 2x leveraged high yield etn should be expect to decline over time can be a cause of concern or even scary   however   understand that this be due to the fact that expense and fee be deduct from the net indicative   asset   value of a 2x leveraged high yield etn   rather than the income   should alleviate some of the concern   deduct the fee and expense from income rather than principal would not impact the actual return receive from invest in 2x leveraged high yield etns   the expect decline over time of the net indicative   asset   value and dividend be a consideration   however   once the magnitude of this factor be understand   -pron- should not be much of an impediment to invest in these 2x leveraged high yield etn      lower libor rate would alleviate this concern   since   at current level   the implicit libor interest expense comprise most of the total expense and fee that be deduct from the net indicative   asset   value of a 2x leveraged high yield etn    prospect the 2x leveraged mreit etns   the prospect of weak economic growth have already cause the federal reserve to cut interest rate   much soon than many have forecast during the last 8 year   the consensus now be that the next move by the federal reserve will be to further lower rate   however   2x leveraged mreit base etn have generally decline along with the equity market when protectionist policy and trade war fear have roil stock market   that have occur even though mreits   mortgage and mortgage back security that be hold by mreits   would generally not be impact by trade policy relate risk as much as would be the case with many other sector of the economy and security that be related to those sector   possible reason for this be discuss in   mreits be underperforming as interest rates decline   why    the financial market have be mostly trade   on a day to day basis   on trade and tariff news   many market participant fear that president trump s trade and tariff policy threaten economic activity   in trump s trade policies   america s brexit    the risk relate to protectionism be discuss in depth   lately   the news have be dominate by the prospect that trump could be remove from office   as a result of -pron- attempt to coerce ukraine   by hold up military aide to ukraine that congress have appropriate   to come up with damaging material on joe biden and or biden s son   these two factor   trade and possible impeachment   could be relate   in term of the outlook for economic growth and the equity market    -pron- appear that the house of representatives will likely enact article of impeachment   in order for trump to be remove   two third of the senate must vote to convict -pron-   that do still seem somewhat of a long shot   as of today   most of the republican senators be keep quiet   some have say that -pron- see no quid pro quo when trump ask the president of ukraine for a favor   in -pron- discussion of military aid to ukraine   which trump be hold up at the time   some senator have find the whistleblower s complaint and the report of the inspector general disturbing   this be reminiscent of what happen with nixon   initially   most republican legislator support nixon   however   as the evidence mount   -pron- turn against -pron-    whereas   previously   many think that   even if the house of representatives do enact article of impeachment   the senate may not even take the matter up   today   that do not seem as politically tenable   this would suggest a trial

approach 25   for 2x leveraged etns    do that compensate for risks   -pron- say       trump famously say    -pron- could shoot someone on 5th avenue and not lose any vote    that have now be replace by   trump could be catch on videotape hand american military secret to russia and still not have any republican vote for impeachment    whatev evidence and proof of criminal act that mueller could have come up with   -pron- be certain that such evidence and proof could not be as a powerful indication of wrongdoing as the evidence in the public record that bret kavanaugh be lie in the senate

1982   and ford s description of the interior of gaudette s house in rockville   md exactly match that of the actual house   which still exist   the only way that kavanaugh be not lie be either   ford somehow obtain access to -pron- 1982 diary calendar   or ford have a time machine or ford stalk kavanaugh in 1982 and plan to do this   if and when -pron- be nominate to the supreme court     there be now some possibility that   as be the case with nixon   the republican legislator will be absolutely against impeachment until -pron- aren t   when nixon resign as -pron- removal become a certainty   president ford and most of the other republicans call for a break from some of nixon s policy   a similar scenario could occur if mike pence become president as the result of trump s removal    if trump be replace by a president pence   -pron- could be a dream come true for the business community and the stock market   -pron- be likely that president pence would retain everything that business love about trump   these would include low business tax and the reduction of regulation   appointing judge who tend to favor employer rather than labor would also be a plus for business that pence would surely retain   while keep the thing that business like about trump   pence would likely remove the thing that corporate america fear and loathe about trump    business and the stock market would cheer a return to the free trade policy republicans have traditionally stand for   as politico report       pence succeed -pron- good friend david mcintosh in congress   now the president of the

campaign against   in the letter   pence argue that   reduce tariff and other trade barrier so that indiana business can enjoy increased market access and fairly compete on the world stage be something that congress must do        additionally   the business community and the stock market would likely take comfort in the reduce risk that trump could take some reckless action that could precipitate military conflict   especially in the persian gulf region   when gerald ford succeed nixon   some of nixon s policy be reverse   the status of america s participation in the war in southeast asia be the most significant   a president pence could likewise try to distance -pron- from some of trump s policy that most distressed the business community    as be discuss in trump s trade policies   america s brexit    concern that trump s trade policy could cause an economic collapse be well found   however   there have always be an optimistic view that trade policy risk could possibly evaporate overnight   trump and some of -pron- adviser such as larry kudlow assert that trump be really a free trade advocate who want to eliminate all tariff and trade restriction   in that respect   trump could be think of as less likely to destroy the world trading system than the truly commit protectionist like peter navarro   bernie sanders   and senator sherrod brown   d ohio   who be prime example of the   progressivism of fool   branch of protectionist   the only objective of tariff support by those protectionist be to transfer wealth to the employee and owner of favor domestic producer   that the cost and loss to the rest of americans far exceed the gain to the employee and owner of favor domestic producer be never a concern of the   progressivism of fool   branch    how would a recession impact 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn    for the last eight year   -pron- investment thesis have be that interest rate will be relatively low for long than many believe   this lead -pron- to seek out investment such as inverse floater that would benefit from that forecast   as describe in -pron- article   be mreits the new inverse floater    as there be no inverse floater available for -pron- to invest in   -pron- conclude that mreits be the next close thing   in 2011   there be a few individual mreits with current yield above 15    there be even less now   since 2012   when morl become available -pron- have focus on 2x leveraged etn to obtain current yield above 15     there be significant difference between agency inverse floater and mreits   the most important be that mreits be manage   whereas inverse floater be note govern by indenture   as be etn   thus   even if interest rate decline   the management of a particular mreit could have hedge away any of the gain that would have be expect from the decline in rate   additionally   most mreits   even those whose objective be to primarily invest in agency security   can take credit risk   thus   a recession that cause default in mortgage hold be an mreit could hurt those mreits    even though the great risk associate with the 2x leverage mreit base etns be interest rate risk   high long term rate be a two edge sword for mreits   high long term rate reduce the value of -pron- mortgage portfolio   and thus   the book value of the share   the other side of the two edge sword be that high long term rate and low price of mortgage security provide an opportunity for mreits to reinvest the monthly principal payment -pron- receive in high yielding mortgage security   a highly leverage mreit with   say   9 to 1 leverage and cpr of 11   would be generate new cash available for reinvestment from prepayment of principal each year approximately equal to the entire equity of the mreit   the flip side of that two edge sword be that low long term interest rate reduce the coupon income on new mortgage back security buy by the mreits   -pron- be already see some dividend cut result from that effect   the possibility that negative interest rate could occur in america make the picture even cloudy    as be discuss in   bank issue could impact 20   yield etn   a french court order switzerland s large

of a trial   of course   then the country and financial market may start to worry about the possibility of the democrats enact some of the harmful policy and social program that have be try and   in

especially true since morl s identical twin mrrl and reml be still available at very close to net asset value   there may be   at time   some sort of a short squeeze occur in morl   these be dangerous to participate in from either side   however   some short term trader may want to get involve   for investor who own high yield 2x leveraged etn for the very high current yield   if -pron- be make a

on balance   -pron- still tend to believe that the massive tax policy induce increase in inequality will cause increase excess of loanable and investable fund   above commercially reasonable way to

in -pron- pessimistic perception of how mreits will behave in a recession   this suggest diversification may be even more important than usual   in any case   -pron- s always good to remember   as keynes famously say    the market can stay irrational long than -pron- can stay solvent     the phenomenon of the old 2x leveraged high yield etn trade significantly above -pron- net indicative

at some point in the future   in the 2x leveraged etns base on mreits sector   this could apply to reml    one reason that sale may be suspend by the issuer could be to allow -pron- brokerage arm to

recent fed move didn t prevent jpmorgan from hit a record high three day later   and to trade in a narrow range since then   investor seem to believe that jpmorgan s fundamental business strength will be able to outweigh the short term effect of low interest rate    while rate cut lop   1 billion from jpmorgan s project net interest income for the year   -pron- s much good for the bank to have a fed that s willing to support the economy with stimulus measure to boost asset value   increase financing activity and possibly extend growth    why jpmorgan s still in good shape   set aside cyclical

resource that many small bank don t have to build out fintech capability that be a key competitive advantage    to unify -pron- branding   jpmorgan shut down -pron- branchless banking service call

down on costly error   ai also power virtual assistant that can answer question and support internal help desk    keep an eye on jpmorgan chase   jpmorgan will report -pron- late quarterly result on oct   15   give investor a chance to hear more about management s outlook for the come year   along with an initial look at how rate cut in july and september affect -pron- income   -pron- s be 12 year since the fed last start an ease cycle   and bank like jpmorgan be the first to feel the effect of change in monetary policy   -pron- also have a front row seat on how rate cut affect consumer   business   market and the broad economy    the consensus estimate indicate that jpmorgan s earning will rise 4 7   to   2 45 per share   but the bank have surprised to the upside for the past two quarter   jpmorgan s valuation be slightly above the industry average   put a premium on good result   however   in -pron- view   jpmorgan merit a high valuation for long term holder with -pron- stable balance sheet   expansion plan   and technological expertise   -pron- ll be interesting to see whether the bank s result bear out that thesis later this month

those be some of the highlight for the q4 and 2018    -pron- ll get into the 2019 guidance now   so   report revenue will be in the range of   1 01 billion to   1 03 billion   a 15   the 17   increase over report revenue of 2018   of which   62 million to   62 million   ph   be non core revenue relate to cianna   vascular insight   bd   ninepoint and a couple of other acquisition   and that include

 that s a 165 basis point to 200 basis point improvement over -pron- 2018 and the non gaap gross margin of 48 9     the margin improvement be build up of several different piece   specifically from a mix of operational efficiency   cost save initiative and -pron- recent acquisition   -pron- do plan on move -pron- malvern manufacturing into -pron- mexico facility   which -pron- expect to contribute   3 million to   5 million in saving once fully transfer   those transfer expense be include in -pron- guidance   and -pron- start the transfer in q4 of 2018 and -pron- expect that transfer to be

regulatory requirement   clinical study and support for -pron- therapeutic product    move on to the tax rate   -pron- forecast include a tax rate of approximately 22 5   to 24 5    again   -pron- continue to be conservative here as more guidance on tax reform come out and -pron- have a good understanding of the new tax rule    eps gaap will range between   1 02 and   1 13 for 2019   on a non gaap basis   the range will be between   1 97 and   2 08   with the increase come from -pron- core business   acquisition and continue benefit from tax reform   and as a reminder   this also include the additional 4 million share from -pron- follow on    now   that be a lot of information   but -pron- think -pron- 2019 guidance show that the business continue to be robust   which allow -pron- to cover the investment -pron- ne to make for -pron- continued growth and margin expansion   and this include -pron- investment in the new european regulatory requirement   mdr   clinical study for a

the new mdr and -pron- think -pron- ve estimate that s   3 million or   4 million of expense that -pron- put into -pron- number    -pron- s just an uncertain world all the time   but what -pron- be certain of be the momentum   the new product   just the overall efficiency in the business and the focus of -pron- operational group   and -pron- think the work that s come out of -pron- fp a group in

there s nothing quite like be on the battlefield and watch a skilled physician treat a patient   and -pron- think this physician make a couple of comment about how important this technology be   -pron- watch the physician   the surgeon use the cianna probe at least 30 time   as -pron- be excise mass on this patient and -pron- become more convinced that this acquisition be an extraordinary opportunity for the company    and so -pron- just want to build -pron- confidence in that   but -pron- also want to make sure that as -pron- look at the kind of the scorecard for last year   look at stand alone device up 33    almost 34   custom kit   a little bit slow at 7   and -pron- s one of the area that -pron- re not push   so those be the low margin product   if -pron- look at inflation device   -pron- think -pron- s just very interesting to note that -pron- be up almost 16   for the year and -pron- have a couple of new entry into the marketplace for merit this year   and -pron- believe that -pron- market share be go to continue to grow in that particular area as -pron- look forward   -pron- look at catheter at 22   and -pron- look at -pron- ep business at 16 5    the only one that -pron- think maybe need a little explanation be -pron- embolization device and these be thing like embosphere and -pron- quadrasphere   and -pron- think -pron- ve have a lot of competition come into that market area    and so -pron- hope that define new   -pron- know who the name be that -pron- re compete with   -pron- do have a new product this year call the embocube   -pron- ve release that product   -pron- be get a very   very good response   -pron- s very convenient for physician   so   -pron- s -pron- belief that that will start to add into this number mostly improvement this year   and then if -pron- look down at the endoscopy business   endotek   at 22     so if -pron- look at that   -pron- look at the new product   -pron- look at the efficiency of the business go forward   -pron- make -pron- comfortable with -pron-   19 and -pron- view of the 2020 business in term of what merit hop and plan to deliver   so   listen   -pron- think that pretty well speak to -pron-   -pron- m go to go ahead now and turn some time back over to -pron- administrator   and just a reminder that raul and -pron- will be here for an hour or two follow the call for clarification   no new information   but just clarification on various aspect that -pron- may have that -pron- re interested in    so   that be say   let s turn the time over to administrator   and -pron- be ready now for -pron- question    question and answer    operator    operator instruction   -pron- first question or comment come from the line of matthew o brien from piper jaffray   -pron- line be open    matthew o brien     piper jaffray     analyst   afternoon guy   thank so much for take the question   just for starter on cianna   -pron- d love to hear a little bit more about the integration there   sale force retention and do -pron- think about that business add after -pron- get through this year   something on the order of magnitude of 100 basis point to 150 basis point organic growth go forward   and then -pron- be sorry for such a long wind question   but the rest of the business this year and next year would still have to be deliver quite a bit of growth   so   where do all of that come from   be -pron- emerge market   -pron- product introduction   et cetera    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   yes   matt   thank -pron- very much   there be a lot of stuff there and -pron- be ponder -pron- question   on the cianna business   the integration   -pron- think be go as well as to be expect   but -pron- mean   -pron- be spend a lot of time -pron- ve be down there two or three time to southern california   -pron- have team down there yesterday   -pron- ve go order to cash   in term of the sale force   everybody be essentially still online   -pron- recently have president s club and -pron- invite -pron- good producer to join -pron- at that meeting   -pron- join -pron- in all of -pron- national meeting and international meeting   -pron- will tell -pron- that when -pron- be in europe recently   all of the sale people over there who be come to -pron- say that -pron- get two or three inquiry a week as to when will the product be available   -pron- re expect approval at any time   could be late this quarter   but very likely second quarter for the cianna business    so that s important   so -pron- think everything be work quite nicely   the r d guy     think on the administrative side   some of those position have turn over   those have be essentially voluntary where people who have work in sort start up company move to another start up company   but in term of the sale force   which ultimately   in -pron- view   be the most important factor   -pron- ve essentially have no turnover in that particular area   -pron- think   that s a good start    as -pron- mention   when -pron- get out in a procedure and -pron- see how the physician use this product   this physician say to -pron- in dallas that this be the great innovation in woman s healthcare and breast care in 50 year   and that s not -pron- quote   that s     that be -pron- quote and so -pron- think that the other thing that help -pron- as be in those procedure   matt   as -pron- get to see what -pron- mean in term of the importance in other product   there be several other idea that come up and -pron- have no match than four   five r d product and that r d team be still in place as well    so   -pron- think -pron- ve manage this correctly   in term of the growth go forward   -pron-     -pron- think be try to be conservative   -pron- job be to make sure that whatev -pron- give -pron- be something that -pron- can attain and then to move on to the opportunity   now   -pron- personally   don t have the number in front of -pron- in term of -pron- growth go forward   but   -pron- will tell -pron- that -pron- have high expectation personally than -pron- have when -pron- first buy the business because -pron- be understand these good and -pron- do due diligence    -pron- mean   -pron- just   a lot of work on the operation   the manufacturing   the sale force   -pron- talk to customer   but -pron- couldn t     -pron- can t say enough good thing about cianna   and what -pron- think ultimately what mean of this business go forward   that s a long answer    matthew o brien     piper jaffray     analyst   no   -pron- s a long question   so -pron- appreciate that fred   and then as a follow up question   just the top line outlook be great   the gross margin outlook be great   -pron- mean   the bottom line outlook in total be great   but -pron- do   -pron- do account for some of the high either sg a or r d spending than -pron- have model   so can -pron- just help -pron- understand where some of that extra spend come from in either of those two line item    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   raul   -pron- answer that    raul parra     chief financial officer   yes   operating expense be in line there about 35   for 2019   interest expense be in there too   so -pron- may be pick that up   -pron- m not sure -pron- when model there   but -pron- do have some additional expense that -pron-     that -pron- talk about in the guidance and that relate to mdr   -pron- be move the malvern facility over to mexico   -pron- ve get some new regulatory requirement   which -pron- just mention   the mdr   and then -pron- also have clinical study for the rhapsody   so those be expense that be be bake in into -pron- guidance    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   matt   if -pron- could jump in on that too   -pron- mean   -pron- think that -pron- ve always try to say that this merit make this transition between the company that -pron- have be in the past to these more therapeutic product that -pron- take more clinical support   -pron- take the study on the r d line and rather than miss or do this math on those kind of operating expense   -pron- ve choose that for the last several year to keep those maintain   so that -pron- can put those type of structure   clinical training and those thing and make sure that there a priority   so again   what -pron- re really focus on be make sure that any acquisition -pron- make be into one of -pron- silo that -pron- be a product that help to be an improvement in gross margin   but -pron- think -pron- ve be able to do that   so   the formula that -pron- ve used for the last four   five year be work and work very   very well and -pron- think -pron- believe that those thing will continue to work in the future   so that s -pron- general belief   raul   anything further    raul parra     chief financial officer   nothing   that s all    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   okay   very good    matthew o brien     piper jaffray     analyst   thank so much   appreciate -pron-    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   thank -pron-   sir    operator   thank -pron-   -pron- next question or comment come from the line of bruce nudell from suntrust   -pron- line be open    bruce nudell     suntrust     analyst   good afternoon   guy   and congratulation on a very successful year   fred   other have articulate the guidance   -pron- look great and -pron- have two pretty simple question   one   next year organic guidance be 8   to 10    what be kind of the factor that could kind of push -pron- to the low end and conversely push -pron- to the high end   and secondly   -pron- s kind of unusual but welcome for company to put out a second     of -pron- size to put out 2020 guidance   and what give -pron- the confidence to really take that forward look step   that s -pron-   thank so much    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   thank -pron-   bruce   a number of thing   bruce   here -pron- be two month into the year and as -pron- go down another month or so   -pron- be already be ask by analyst   what about 2020   what about this and what about that   and -pron- think to -pron-   look   -pron- be confident   -pron- ve have two or three month of cianna   -pron- confidence be build there   -pron- would say the same thing about vascular insight   there s opportunity for -pron- there as well   that s a small deal   but   -pron- think there be thing like the preludesync   which be     this be the wrist band   and then -pron- ve add to -pron- a product that really nobody else have right now   and that s the distal radial sync and that s a product that -pron- come into the area know as the snuffbox   -pron- s a different approach and -pron- remember last night   -pron- get -pron- a text from someone that be tweet out about     there be a picture of bunch of physician who have just adopt -pron- and be the first hospital in the that system in louisiana    so that s important   the ideal be probably     -pron- don t want to call -pron- a surprise   but the pretty good   ph   idea which give -pron- a large id and a small od   so   -pron- allow -pron- to take the     put a large device and give -pron- flexibility   -pron- s a sheath   but the sheath be sell for in the range of   50 to   80 and when take a product like that that -pron- s a big hit in australia   that s a big hit in the canada   -pron- s     in canada   -pron- ve have a little bit of a problem   just kind of keep up with -pron-   -pron- ve bring additional capacity on and then -pron- look at the pipeline of product    the embocube   as -pron- mention in -pron- comment   be a product that have a gel foam that be produce in -pron- facility in france and the product be a convenience to physician   in fact   the good response from customer that see -pron- be   why didn t -pron- think about   and when -pron- hear that from a customer   that s kind of a nice thing   -pron- mean   -pron- know that what -pron- re do be solve a problem from    so   -pron- think that s part of -pron-   -pron- take a look at some new spine product that -pron- have that be come -pron- way   -pron- take a look at new balloon   -pron- take a look at new inflation system   so   -pron- mean   -pron- s a kind of across the board in endoscopy   in cardiac reason   in peripheral medicine   -pron- mean   just everything   if -pron- can go through the slide deck   and -pron- s a good time for -pron- to make sure that everybody look at because what -pron- try to do be to put into the slide deck kind of a preview of come attraction   and whether -pron- be temno elite   now     so here s merit    -pron- m give -pron- a long answer   but     so here s the     -pron- just now anniversari the becton dickinson deal   so that -pron- think be on february 14th   -pron- already have a product that -pron- ll see call the temno elite   which again along with -pron- corvocet and other product -pron- believe be thing that just put -pron- first in class and so as -pron- work through that manufacturing and bring that online at -pron- think attractive manufacturing price    in one of the slide   -pron- think -pron- s on page 9   -pron- ll see -pron- nu star ablation system   and this be a big deal   -pron- ll see a new device that -pron- use in the electrophysiology area   so   again   -pron- put a lot of slide in here to again support and answer -pron- question about the new product that -pron- have come online this year   so -pron- s all of that   -pron- s the mature of the sale force   -pron- s the stability of the sale force   raul   -pron- ll let -pron- jump in on this    raul parra     chief financial officer   yes   not   -pron- mean -pron- think -pron- ve be get question since november essentially on what 2020 be go to look like or what -pron- be go to do with -pron- long term plan   but -pron- think -pron- be only     -pron- think if -pron- make sense just to extend that     originally   -pron- think   fred   -pron- think -pron- may do something in june   but -pron- -pron- think feel confident enough in the number and -pron- momentum that -pron- go ahead and put out the 2020 guidance    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   and then finally      bruce nudell     suntrust     analyst   and -pron- gues just      fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   well   go ahead please    bruce nudell     suntrust     analyst   -pron- m sorry   just     2019 guidance   8   to 10   organic   what get -pron- to 8    what get -pron- to 10     fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   yes   these be good question   so   -pron- think -pron- s     get -pron- approval and get on the market   so -pron- re always sit here a number of these product that -pron- re see on here be schedule to release   some of -pron- require approval   some of -pron-   inaudible   the disruption of brexit   one of the thing that -pron- have find be that in great britain have a presence there mean bring a big deal in term of the confidence of customer    -pron- have recently a conversation with     -pron- want to be careful how -pron- say this   but with those who run the healthcare system   who     have that presence and know that -pron- prepare for brexit by have that facility be a big deal and some company haven t do that   and so clearly no matter how -pron- go   -pron- ll work at merit   as a company that s make a commitment   -pron- ve be in great britain for a long time   but -pron- s a situation -pron- re see a lot of growth in those opportunity   so -pron- s the international business   china     -pron- be slow down in -pron- own mind on china a little bit   but -pron- know what   -pron- hasn t slow down at all   in fact   joe wright   who be responsible for southeast asia and the pacific rim   as -pron- look at vietnam and obviously     so -pron- just think that the momentum   the preparation   the new product   -pron- s not all stat into on silo   these be high margin product   so -pron- think that     and by the way   just -pron- s kind of go through -pron-   if -pron- take a look at what -pron- do   and raul 
 once -pron- give -pron- the number for -pron- core growth last year     for the year    raul parra     chief financial officer   11 4    for the year and then 13 1   for the quarter    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   yes   11 4   and 13 1    but     -pron- mean   those be for the year   so -pron- ve move this up because -pron- confidence be grow and -pron- -pron- believe   south africa   -pron- ve go and now have -pron- own warehouse and -pron- own sale force there   simply because the margin be extraordinary   but get the product there be always the problem   so now -pron- have a warehouse   -pron- can deliver same day to -pron- customer   that give -pron- a huge advantage over competitor and -pron- get retail price instead of wholesale   so   on the downside   because -pron- ve always just talk about the upside   -pron- ve get     do -pron- miss anything on brexit   be there any public policy issue that come to play    raul parra     chief financial officer   geopolitical    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   geopolitical disruption   weather     last year when -pron- have maria that slow everything down a bit and that affect -pron-   so -pron- s mostly those kind of unpredictable issue on the downside and maybe -pron- enthusiasm on the upside   raul    raul parra     chief financial officer   yes   -pron- think the only one thing -pron- will add   -pron- re go direct in a couple market and just make sure that -pron- understand that if there s any hiccup   -pron- ve get a little bit of room there    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   yes    bruce nudell     suntrust     analyst   thank so much guy   congratulation    fred lampropoulos     chairman and chief executive officer   thank -pron-   sir    operator   thank -pron-   -pron- next question or comment come from the line of larry biegelsen from wells fargo   -pron- line be open    adam maeder     wells fargo     analyst   hi   guy   -pron- s adam maeder in for larry   congrat on a nice finish to the year   and thank for take the quest,,,,,,,

that nearly all the vendor be cashless   -pron- payment badge flash green for wechat pay and blue for alipay   in fact   the more dominant ant financial   which jack ma control have be heavily compete with tencent for retailer   user   and relationship with financial institution    and competition seem only set to heat up   as the people s bank of china   pboc    the country s central bank

that s why -pron- have expand -pron- market share so quickly     if these deal be more the rule than the exception   then expect tencent s balance sheet to suffer as the company continue to expand

y o y to rmb 86 7bn   mainly from cloud investment   operate cash flow be almost unchanged from 2017    the point here be that tencent s success at these initiative be in no way assure   and success
