of the opportunity for -pron- business but on the other hand if -pron- have never execute the business profitably why would people give -pron- all that money -pron- mean -pron- probably will modern tech funding market can get -pron- arbitrarilyclose to this extreme still the why seem like a reasonable question the -pron- co the parent company of wework have raise about 12 8 billion from private investor in -pron- nine year of operation naively -pron- may think that that much money could pay for rent and spruce up a lot of building and that wework could then find tenant for those building and make a lot of money if -pron- goal be to rapidly scale -pron- building rent business 12 8 billion would probably get -pron- a lot of the way there but not all the way in fact wework have a net loss of about 1 9 billion in 2018 and of about 904 million in the first half of 2019 as -pron- continue to pursue rapid growth wework explain -pron- continue to operate in a state where the majority of -pron- location be non mature and have not reach stable operate performance -pron- could be profitable but -pron- would rather grow and so -pron- be seek to raise 9 or 10 billion from an initial public offering 3 or 4 billion in the ipo -pron- and another 6 billion in bank loan contingent on the ipoto keep throw into that furnace that do not seem to be go especially well but another way to look at -pron- be no actually this be great -pron- present wework with a golden opportunity to manage -pron- profitability profile anyway anyway anyway and here be bloomberg news on softbanks effort to postpone the ipo on the other hand the wework initial public offering be full speed ahead source familiar with the matter tell cnbcs david faber one possibility here be thatsoftbank group corp -pron- affiliate vision fund and weworks other private investor own stake in a high quality business with fundamentally sound unit economic give the attractive market opportunity -pron- would like -pron- to raise another giant slug of moneyto continue -pron- rapid growth but public investor have start to doubt thequality of -pron- business and be not willing to fund -pron- growth at a price reflect -pron- strong fundamental so wework can step back remain private slow -pron- growth flip to profitabilityand just harvest the rich reward of rent out office space for more than -pron- cost then after -pron- demonstrate how profitable the underlying business be maybe public investor will start clamor to get in to fund more growth or maybe -pron- will not and softbank et al will just own stake in a lucrative private business that send -pron- fat dividend every year from all the money -pron- be make there be other possibility the investor who doubt wework underlie business model havereadthat paragraph -pron- quote above the one about how wework can turn on the profit at any time -pron- have doubt anyway one nice thing about postpone the ipo be that -pron- get to find out miss out on the 10 billion of public money would slow down weworks growth plan but if wework be right then there be just a dialthat -pron- can turn betweengrowth and profit and dial down the growth automatically dial up the profit if -pron- be confident that -pron- posses this dial and that -pron- work this way then delay the ipo be a no brainer sure -pron- delay -pron- positive expect value growth but -pron- get to keep ownership of a good lucrative business rather than sell -pron- too cheap on the other hand if the dial turn out not to work then -pron- will end up wish -pron- would sell -pron- cheap elsewhere aswath damodaran make an effort to value wework and come up with about 13 75 billion which be probably not a number that softbank want to hear andwework plan to rely on junk bond for funding for the foreseeable future and could also explore whole business securitization -pron- look forward to read that prospectus and wework bonds drop below par for first time since ipo filing and at stratechery ben thompson consider the big picture and here isfr wilson on why positive cashflow matters if -pron- have positive cashflow -pron- can control the timing and term of -pron- capital raise positive cash flow put -pron- on control versus the capital market ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh what happen here be that the estate of lehman brothers be sell off some random scrap of bond include 22 955 peruvian government gdn exotix want to buy some different bond and to get that trade do also agree to take the gdns off of lehmans hand each gdn have a face value of 1 000 peruvian sol about 354at the time but -pron- seem that neither the lehman trader charge with unload -pron- nor the exotix trader who agree to buy -pron- know that all -pron- know be that the bond trade for 91 5 cent on the dollar and thaton -pron- screen -pron- see something like 22 955 peru gdns there be a perennial extremely low grade yet haunt problem in finance which be this if -pron- look at a screen and see 22 955 peru gdns do that mean 1 22 955solesworth of gdn or 2 22 955 gdn each with a face value of 1 000 sol this be not a peruvianproblem and -pron- may similarly wonder if 22 955 apple bond mean 22 955 worth of bond or 22 955 bond worth 23 million there be no absolutely reliable universal convention though context generally clear -pron- up for one thing peruvian gdn seem to come in 1 000 sol unit just as many dollar bond come in 1 000 unit so -pron- could not actually buy 22 955 sol worth of gdn if -pron- try so there would have be noconfusion if either trader know anything about peruvian gdn which -pron- apparently do not for another thing people usually just do not have three order of magnitude of uncertainty about the size of -pron- trade like if someone -pron- regularly trade with call -pron- up and offer -pron- ten thousand bond or ten million bond -pron- would be the sort of person who regularly trade 10 000 or 10 million or 10 billion worth of bond with -pron- so -pron- would just instinctively understand if bond there mean dollar worth of bond or thousand dollar increment of bond but this trade be a weird scrap that neither side be pay attention to -pron- have no practice deal in peruvian gdn and thecontext be lose and so somehow both trader just assume without specify that 22 955 gdn mean 22 955 sol worth of gdn rather than 23 million worth and so lehman agree to sell -pron- and exotix agree to buy -pron- at a price of 91 5 cent on the dollar or about 7 438 for the lot if -pron- think the lot be 22 955 sol worth as -pron- do and exotix wire lehman the 7 438 plus a little bit of accrue interest and lehman send exotix 7 4 million worth of bond and then exotix figure -pron- out and after some internal hesitation decide -pron- would keep -pron- -pron- pause at this point to spend some happy minute in contemplation of that internal hesitation and almost write -pron- a little imagine dialogue to capture exotixs reaction to find an extra 7 4 million of free bondsand -pron- debate about whether to give -pron- back but then -pron- read further in the court judgment and that hesitation be actually describe in some detail and good than -pron- could have imagine lehman eventually figure this out though only after exotix have sell the bond -pron- sue in an english court and yesterday lehman win -pron- have be quote from the judgment -pron- fine either way would be fine really an early version of this newsletter say that exotix win because -pron- misread -pron- sorry though -pron- suppose there be something appropriately metaabout that a basic way to do market manipulation be -pron- own some stock and -pron- want to sell -pron- so youdo some trade with -pron- friend at high price so bystandersthink the stock trade at a high price and then -pron- sell the stock to someone else at a high price this work sometimes imperfectly because practically speak the main input into most people valuation model be the price if a stock trade at 10 people tend to think -pron- worth 10 so -pron- can probably sell -pron- to -pron- for 10 another basic way to do security fraud be -pron- own a company and -pron- want to sell some stock so -pron- put out fake financial statement that say that -pron- company make a lot of money last quarter and fake announcement that -pron- will make even more money next quarter and then -pron- sell

electoral politic involve -pron- early to speculate on such thing of course there s be no polling on the whistle blower complaint that prompt this announcement nor do -pron- knowwhether the house will wind up vote for impeachment or what the senate will do but -pron- can think about how public opinion and election normally work and how the uncertainty of impeachment may factor in so far president donald trump be unpopular and poll say so be impeachment -pron- expect the latter to change the more that highly visible democrats be unite in favor of impeachment the more that democratic voter and independent who dislike trump will likely shift towardtheir position -pron- would not be surprised if that shift happen rapidly at least if the news media give saturation coverage to the story and voter startto learn more about -pron- -pron- think -pron- a lot less likely that trumps popularity will change yes president richard nixons approval rating drop dramatically over the course of the watergate scandal but there be a lot of difference start with the fact that trump have a lot less ground to lose -pron- possible that new fact could push mild trump supporter into be mild trump opponent and so onfor other level of support buti would not count on a lot of that what really could hurttrumpwould be if numerous high profile republicans turn against -pron- that s unlikely because those republican know that the less popular trumpis the bad off all party candidate will be in the next election but if trumps approval rating be go be harm that s how -pron- will happen could impeachment actually make trump more popular that too be possiblebut unlikely president bill clinton be probably help by a partisan impeachment that most neutral opinion leader and even some republicans think be a bad idea -pron- do not think that s where elite opinion will be this time if however this wind up unite congressional republicans and some democrats go along in opposition -pron- could conceivably help trump but -pron- would not count on -pron- one reason -pron- s go to keep do thing that people who have turn against -pron- do not like assume trump survif and become the republican nominee next year the effect of impeachment per se on the presidential election will probably be smalland possiblynonexistent -pron- do not know how long any impeachment and trial would last but voter tend to have shockingly short memory what about congressional election in 1974 republicans lostin a landslide soon after nixon resign that be in large part a story about expectation since both party expect disaster for republicans strong democrats run while strong republicans do not and democrats maximize -pron- resource while republicans fail to voter be not try to punish nixon or new president gerald ford but the effect of a highly unpopular presidency matter in 1998 democrats do very well for a midtermwith a second term president actually gain seat in the house congressional election expert gary jacobson find that republicans actually be help in candidate recruitment by the clinton scandal but that impeachment underway at election time be unpopular with voter which hurt -pron- the net effect jacobson conclude be probably a wash right now be in the period where candidate include incumbent be decide whether to run in 2020 so expectation about how impeachment will play out could certainly have some influence but -pron- would expect fewvoter tochoosecandidate base mainly on impeachment which will presumably be long over by then in fact -pron- suspect democratic hope of use impeachment against marginal senate republicans such as susan collins in maine and cory gardner in colorado be likely to fizzle as be republican hope of use impeachment againsthouse democrats who wonin republican friendly district in 2018 those candidate may lose but -pron- guess be that impeachment vote will not be a major factor and may be no factor at all 1

marcus overstock david shaw and wework the simple weird thing about the spike in repo rate two week ago be thatthere be a day when big bank could borrow money at around 2 unsecured overnight and lend -pron- out overnight secure by treasury for at least 5 maybe as high as10 on sept 17 overnight libor a measure of bank unsecured borrowing cost be about 2 15 up from about 2 11 the day before 1 the federal fund effective rate another measure of unsecured bank borrowing be 2 30 up from 2 25 the day before meanwhile the secure overnight finance rate a broad measure of the cost of repo that be overnight borrow secure by treasury be at 5 25 up from2 43 the day before the 99th percentile sofr borrower pay 9 and rate as high as 10 be report the cost of unsecured borrowing for bank go up a little the cost of secured borrowing against treasury shoot up a lot the world should not work that way if big rational financial actor have the capacity to borrow at 2 and lend risk free at 5 or10 -pron- should do that all day long but really -pron- should only be able to do -pron- for a few minute until the rate converge like there s a lot of money over here not enough money over there -pron- connect a pipe between -pron- and collect a fee until the amount level out -pron- do not know this be kind of how financeworks but that s not how -pron- work on sept 17 and repo rate only get back to normal sofr on friday be 1 82 versus 1 83 for fed fund and 1 83 for libor 2 after the federal reserve intervene by set up -pron- own pipe and lending in the repo market a lot of people have talk about a lot of cause for this and -pron- will list some here as long as -pron- promise not to email -pron- to say -pron- be miss the most important cause which be that freedonias central bank be liquidate -pron- bitcoin portfolio or whatev post crisis liquidity regulation and real economic need for liquidity havemade -pron- more important for bank to hang on to -pron- money so -pron- may not want to lend out money even at very attractive rate leverage regulation have make -pron- more important for big bank not to borrow so -pron- may not want to borrow to get more money to lend out at very attractive rate the repo market be much big than the fed fund market so if -pron- actually try to suck money from fed fund to repo -pron- would quickly use -pron- all up bank in common usage be actually bank hold company and the actual bank that do the borrowinghave limit on -pron- ability to move money over to -pron- affiliate broker dealer that do the lending lot of other stuff too the essential nature of the problem involve the absence of a pipe where a pipe should be which mean that -pron- explanation will be sort of specific and finicky and plumbing relate but here -pron- want to abstract away from that stuff and just focus on the big simple weird thingthat during the repo spike bank could still borrow at 2 even as -pron- be lend at 5 or 10 and what -pron- tell -pron- one very very simple thing that -pron- tell -pron- one that -pron- be almost embarrassed to mention here because -pron- be so obvious be that the repo spike be not an indication of acrisis for bank the fact that the big bank could at the height of the repo spike borrow unsecuredwithout collateral base only on -pron- own financial strengthat around 2 mean that investor just be not particularly worry that bank be run into trouble the repo spike be bad for some hedge fund and non bank broker dealer people who fund -pron- in the repo market and do not have access to bank type borrowing but the bank be fine fine be not quitethe word the second thing to notice be that the repo spike be an indication of abig opportunity for bank like sure the fact that bank could borrow at 2 and lend at 10 be notarbitrag away which mean that not enough bank be do -pron- but the fact that those rate print mean thatsomebodywa do -pron- bloombergs yalman onaran and shahien nasiripour report that one of those somebodieswasjpmorgan never mind unsecured borrowing bank could lend money to hedge fund or dealersat 5 or 10 secure by treasury and then turn around and borrow against those treasury from money market fund at 3 or 4 the pure sort of pipe connect transaction the money market fund mostly cantlend directly to the hedge fund or dealer 3 but the bank can connect -pron- and take a generally tiny or occasionally gigantic cut the third thing to notice here be that despite this be a big opportunity for bank -pron- mostly do not take advantage ofit some do somewhat but the arbitrage get nowhere close to closing meaning that bank leave a whole lot of money on the table partly that be for regulatory reason liquidity and leverage rule limit the bank ability to lend out the money -pron- have or borrow more partly -pron- be for genuine liquidity risk management reason bank ne to keep money around to settle customer transaction and so be hesitant to lend all of -pron- 4 partly -pron- be for sort of operational muscle memory reason -pron- forget that this be the sort of opportunity -pron- be suppose to seize and how to seize -pron- there be no more fed fund desk at the big bank and the fed staff who use to keep the wheel of the market grease be no longer there glenn havlicek tell onaran and nasiripour so when there be a funding spike nobody remember what to do this mostly seem like a straightforwardlybadresult market should clear money should move from low value to high value use bank be in the business of make that happen and if -pron- can not do -pron- then -pron- be not do -pron- job and something be break and in particular overnight lending secure by treasuriesis about the safe business a bank can be in so bank safety regulation that 1 prevent bank from do that and 2 break that market be probably unhelpful but -pron- tend to think about the post financial crisis rule mainly from a cultural perspective of have -pron- succeed in make bank bore if -pron- have that be not at all an unalloyed good if bank be too boring then -pron- will not be do -pron- job effectively and market may get more exciting and scary to make up the difference and also of course -pron- will have less fun stuff to write about but banking boredom do seem to -pron- to be the centralintendedconsequence of post 2008 regulation and if -pron- want boring bank then the repo spike be almost something to celebrate the market go haywire and create opportunity for bank to make a profit and -pron- mostly pass on -pron- because 1 the rule tell -pron- not to takerisks 2 -pron- own internal requirement tell -pron- not to take risk and 3 -pron- forget how to take risk let say -pron- want to borrow money and arentsure if -pron- be go to pay -pron- back like -pron- be borrow -pron- to do something risky and if the risk do not pan out -pron- will not be able to repay -pron- or maybe -pron- just do not know if when the time come -pron- willfeel like pay -pron- back usually if -pron- borrow money and do not pay -pron- back the lender will come after -pron- for the money but different lender will do that with different level of aggressiveness if -pron- borrow money from -pron- parent and do not pay -pron- back -pron- will occasionally drop awkward hint at family gathering if -pron- borrow from a bank and do not pay -pron- back -pron- may seek to garnish -pron- wage or put lien on -pron- property -pron- probably know enough not toborrow from the mafia and not pay -pron- back in general if -pron- be have doubt about -pron- future ability or desire to repay -pron- should choose a lender who will not come after -pron- very hard where do -pron- think goldman sachs group inc fall on this range naively -pron- may think that the great vampire squid wrap around the face of humanity would becloser to the mafia than -pron- parent but nope the delightful answer be or at least be for a while that in goldmans consumer face marcus businessthey be absolute pussycat and figure that if -pron- do not pay -pron- back -pron- have trouble of -pron- own and -pron- do not want to bother -pron- no -pron- be kid -pron- be absolute pussycat because -pron- figure that if theydidbother -pron- that would look bad for goldman and enough thing look bad enough for goldman that -pron- money be not worth -pron- if -pron- be able to game this out in advanceif -pron- be like -pron- be gon na borrow 10 000 from goldman and not pay -pron- back because the bad publicity of pursue -pron- will deter -pron- from do anythingthen one congratulation on -pron- 10 000 but two send -pron- a resume because really -pron- should be work at goldman not in the consumer business either -pron- could use a bond trader with instinct like your the arbitrage have close now and marcushas dedicated collection staff that be specially train a spokesman say -pron- hope -pron- re specially train to leave a dead squid on -pron- doorstep kid mostly disclosure -pron- use to work at goldman in the pre marcus day when -pron- mostly try to get pay back two of -pron- favorite theme around here be 1 that everything be security fraud and 2 that the going on at overstock com inc be pretty banana so -pron- be nice to see -pron- combine in one story here be the complaint on behalf of a class of overstock shareholder as -pron- have discuss a few time overstock declare a special stock dividend payable in share of -pron- blockchain base digital voting series a 1 preferred stock which would be tradable only on -pron- own blockchain platform and not tradable at all for -pron- first six month eventually the market realize that this would be a big problem for short seller who would be obligate to deliver share of the blockchain stock to -pron- security lender and who would not be able to find any this lead to a short squeeze that drive upoverstocks stock price as short seller capitulate and buy in the stock then this squeeze deflate as broker agree to accept cash in lieu of the series a 1 stock and as people start ask question about whether declare a weird blockchain dividend to cause a short squeeze may be manipulative overstock back down and the dividend be delay and will now be freely tradable immediately also separately from all of this byrne resign as ceo to spend more time blogg about -pron- relationship with a russian spy anyway if that happen be that security fraud oh -pron- do not know the narrow question be like 1 do overstock announce -pron- weird blockchain dividend for the purpose of engineering a short squeeze and 2 if -pron- do would that be a fraud specifically would -pron- be a fraud on people whoboughtoverstock stock at inflated price during the short squeeze from the complaint oh yeah -pron- forget to mention that byrne sell -pron- stock in the middle of all this the whole thing be sonut the good part be that byrne be name as a defendant and -pron- have a hard time see -pron- quietly settle to make this go away so there be a real chance that the case will go to trial in the most over the top -pron- be not out of order the whole system be out of order sort of way this new york magazine propublica article about hedge fund billionaire david shaws allege method for get -pron- kid into college be really something or honestly a lot of thing for one thing there be agossipy account of how shaws highly compensate ivy educate hierarchical household staff work there be the odd irony that shaws wife beth kobliner be a personal finance advice writer the college admission method -pron- be pretty straightforward though -pron- just donate a million dollar a year to a bunch of top college and figure -pron- kid haveto get into one of -pron- -pron- help that the kid seem to be smart and high achieve the article emphasize the portfolio approach from a hedge funder perspective invest in multiple college be a classic asymmetric bet -pron- s hedge -pron- bet etc and fine but to -pron- the most interesting part be thepric specifically thetiersof pricing ouch for brown koblinerwent there and shaw get -pron- ph d at stanford neither of -pron- go to any of the other school also what be that bump for columbia which come after shaws second child start at yale be -pron- worry that the third will need more of a backup plan -pron- have to increase -pron- annual gift to columbia after -pron- brother get intoyale sound to -pron- like an amazingly subtleexpression of billionaire parental disappointment the good line in the story though go to jules feiffer which be both unsurprising -pron- s jules feiffer and surprising what be -pron- do here -pron- come in a paragraph full of great line so be harvard and yale to be fair meanwhile her a bloomberg story about how wework be a family affair in which co founder adam neumann and -pron- wife and nominal co founder rebekah neumann do not have a line at all between work and life as -pron- put -pron- in 2016 -pron- not even a blurred line there be no line -pron- be no longer with the company and -pron- be no longer chief executive officer largely for that reason a sampling yes another way to provide for -pron- children education be to just have thetech startup -pron-

company repay holdings corporation mr greenberg note that spacs offer distinct advantage over traditional ipo include the ability to take a large position early on at a reasonable price baron have play an especially active role in spac deal recently invest in a private placement alongside the spac transaction that take repay holding public mr greenberg say -pron- be supportive of the private placement because -pron- help the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrant greatly reduce potential dilution -pron- note that the amount of warrant attach to spac ipo continue to fall as sponsor gain credibility and initial buyer do not need as much incentive to invest story continue mr heyer bring perspective as both the ceo of two recent spac and a veteran business executive with decade of experience -pron- believe that spac ipo be get large and there be scope for a broad range of acquisition target but -pron- will remain critical to have a top notch operator a financial expert and a business plan that do not depend on too many promise mr heyers late deal be to bring onespaworld public as ceo of haymaker acquisition corp the health and wellness company which operate spa aboard major cruise line such as carnival corporation and royal caribbean cruises ltd have be one of the most successful spac combination in recent year with the share trade

bridge acquisition ltd and simply good foods company conyers park acquisition corp mr denning attribute much of the recent success in spacs to the presence of well regarded private equity firm that remain shareholder after deal close and take board seat to stay on as advisor -pron- also point out that spacs benefit from regulation that allow company to communicate very clearly with investor give guidance for metric such as revenue and ebitda something that s not allow with traditional ipo the complete interview with each of the four roundtable participant can be find below elliott smith partner at winston strawn llp successful spac ne transaction advisor with spac deal make experience often the good acquisition target be growth company rather than distressed asset and while some spac ipo have approach a billion dollar huge spac can encounter challenge in find a viable target that s appropriate in size that s accord to elliott smith partner at winston strawn llp which have advise client in spac transaction include new frontier corporation netfin acquisition corp willscot corporation target hospitality and limbach holdings mr smith also say that spacs can be a fast cheap and easy avenue to become a public company than traditional ipo but also face -pron- own unique challenge the full interview be below elliott m smith focus -pron- practice on corporate and security law elliott advise client on a wide variety of capital market transactional matter include ipo follow on offering and private placement of debt and equity security elliott have particular experience represent spac and -pron- sponsor team in ipo and back end business combination elliott also advise public company client on corporate governance matter and compliance with the federal security law ipo edge how have the warrant feature on spac evolve and where do -pron- see -pron- go mr smith way back in the 1990s spac issue unit consist of one share and two warrant one of which be strike in the money mean the strike price be below the per unit ipo price the in the money warrant function like an immediate capital raise follow the closing of a business combination but create a lot of dilution to stockholder which put pressure on the stock price in the 2000 spac ipo unit evolve to typically include one in the money warrant towards the end of that cycle around 2008 spac start issue unit with one share and one warrant which be strike out of the money these day spacs issue unit in -pron- ipo for 10 00 and the unit include a share and a warrant or a fraction of warrant the warrant have an exercise price of 11 50 per share some repeat sponsor team or sponsor affiliate with well known private equity fund be able to leverage -pron- deal make track record in order to reduce the number of warrant issue as part of the unit to one half or even one third of a warrant by reduce the warrant coverage i e the number of share issuable upon exercise of all the warrant these sponsor can market -pron- spac as more attractive vehicle to target company and investor as compare to other spacs that have more warrant outstanding since the former represent less potential dilution to stockholder upon completion of the business combination the warrant be a necessary sweetener in order to bring investor into a spacs ipo but can be unattractive to potential investor in the stock later on after a business combination because of the overhang over the year spacs have try to mitigate this by eliminate or clean up the warrant at the time of the business combination or shortly thereafter usually through amendment to the warrant agreement that effectively convert the warrant into cash and or share in term of the future warrant will likely always be part of a spacs ipo unit in one form or another and -pron- do not see spac unit include less than one third of a warrant anytime soon ipo edge how do -pron- convince investor to take few warrant with -pron- ipo share mr smith -pron- really a function of investor regard for the quality of the sponsor team and -pron- track record and the investor perception of -pron- ability to find a good target business and complete a business combination top tier sponsor team that generate a lot of investor interest in -pron- ipo can offer less favorable term i e less warrant first time sponsor team rarely can get away with include less than a full warrant in -pron- spac unit and when the market slow down even repeat sponsor will sweeten -pron- ipo with additional warrant coverage in order to get the ipo sell ipo edge what be the key ingredient in get a spac ipo to work mr smith frankly in recent year -pron- have see a lot of first time sponsor team able to complete ipo which make -pron- look like -pron- not too difficult to raise a spac if the sponsor be willing to provide favorable term to ipo investor such as overfund the trust account or provide significant warrant coverage that say -pron- have see some ipo downsize or get pull due to investor skepticism of team that come in to spacs who have not be involve in public deal or growth equity transaction before like distressed asset investor or even successful executive who want to do a spac because -pron- like the look of the potential return but do not have much of a track record for deal make the spac product be really best suited to growth equity story where the right combination of a savvy sponsor and a solid target business generate investor interest distressed asset and value transaction have generally not fare so well with spacs ipo edge some spac have recently raise several hundred million dollar in -pron- ipo can -pron- keep grow what be the remain issue mr smith in the past few year the size of spac ipo have increase in some instance to nearly a billion dollar but oddly enough there be challenge with big spac generally in order to mitigate the dilution from the founder share and warrant a target business should be 3 4x the value of the spacs trust account find a target business with valuation of 2 billion can be challenge for spac company that size often do not need some of the thing a spac offer and can just go do a traditional ipo if desire so the pool of target company can be small for big spac and -pron- have have some sponsor team ask whether -pron- possible to reduce a spacs size after the ipo which be not really possible as a result depend on the industry in which a spac be focused -pron- see repeat sponsor opt to raise spac in the 200 400 million range for maximum flexibility to look for a target 3 4x -pron- size or sometimes large if need spac can scale up for large deal by raise additional capital at the time of the business combination ipo edge what kind of advantage do combination with spacs have over traditional ipo mr smith -pron- can be fast easy and often cheap to go public through a spac than a traditional ipo the traditional ipo process typically take 9 18 month a spac business combination can get do in four month with spacs there s great flexibility regard deal structure marketing material and communication with investor target seller can take more cash off the table than be otherwise possible in a traditional ipo spac marketing material can include projection which be rare for ipo there be also flexibility on timing in an ipo if the market be not there the deal often will need to be pull and the company be back to square one with spacs the transaction term can be re cut to be more favorable to investor additional capital can be bring in through a pipe or debt financing if need and these change can be make in real time during the marketing process right up until the closing in an ipo those kind of change would need to be push through a form s 1 and would likely delay the sec review process so that s another advantage for spac one potential downside of all that flexibility with spacs be that sponsor and target can get deal do even if the transaction be not well receive by the market that can lead to real challenge for the post close company if too many public investor redeem at the time of the business combination the stock will be thinly trade which can make -pron- hard to raise additional capital -pron- can be challenge for post spac company to attract institution to invest in the secondary market if there be low trading volume in the companys stock another thing to remember be that with a traditional ipo the company be typically sell a minority stake in the company to the public so the potential to be oversubscribed can be high in a traditional ipo the offering size can be calibrate to investor demand and the underwriter can ensure there be healthy aftermarket trading in the stock with a spac particularly the large one sponsor have to turn over all the outstanding stock of the spac which can soak up all the demand in the market make for choppy trading follow the close ipo edge what about limitation on spac and can -pron- be improve mr smith the product -pron- be inherently flexible to accommodate all type of transaction -pron- really about the sponsor team and the kind of target business that -pron- br to the market if a spac do not bring a good target business to -pron- shareholder then -pron- do not matter what the warrant coverage be or if the founder be give up some of -pron- founder share public stockholder will redeem -pron- share and the stock price be go to suffer on the other hand -pron- have see spac that have a full warrant do a deal that be well receive and -pron- be able to withstand the overhang issue and create value for investor post close so -pron- really a function of the quality of the transaction as well as the target management team ability to execute on -pron- growth plan that say there be headwind for spac one be perception people continue to view spac as high risk unfortunately there be several example of deal that have go south after close or people remember 2008 when several spac liquidate with no deal unfortunately with each business combination that get do and the stock price tank -pron- a ding on the spac product which be not really right but -pron- about the perception some think that spac have a tendency to overpay when time be run out for -pron- and -pron- ne to find a deal there s probably some truth to that but again if a sponsor team and target companys seller understand the product and the process and be focus on position the company to perform post close then -pron- think those negative factor can be overcome lastly -pron- have hear some sponsor lament that -pron- bank do not show up for -pron- to market the business combination with the same energy compare to a traditional ipo that may be because of how the deferred underwriting fee get allocate within the bank and so there probably be room for improvement there that would help back end deal get execute successfully cliff greenberg senior vice president and portfolio manager at baron funds spac can offer distinct advantage to institutional investor over traditional ipo include the ability to take a large position early on at a reasonable price that s accord to cliff greenberg svp and portfolio manager at baron funds which have invest in a number of recent spac company include at sea spa operator onespaworld ticker osw and payment company repay holdings ticker rpay baron have play an especially active role in spac deal recently invest in a private placement alongside the spac transaction that take repay holding public mr greenberg be supportive of the private placement because -pron- help the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrant greatly reduce potential dilution -pron- note that the amount of warrant attach to spac ipo continue to fall as sponsor gain credibility and initial buyer do not need as much incentive to invest cliff greenberg be the portfolio manager of baron small cap fund -pron- invest in small sized u s company with significant growth potential investment include fall angel with strong long term franchise that have disappoint investor and special situation where lack of investor awareness create opportunity mr greenberg have 35 year of invest experience include 22 year at baron funds ipo edge -pron- fund be instrumental in the process of repay go public through a spac with baron fund participate in a private placement that help extinguish 75 of the warrant in the deal how do -pron- view that situation mr greenberg repay have enough money to close the deal but -pron- advise -pron- to take a little more to immediately buy the warrant the warrant be dilutive and add confusion to the capital structure -pron- also prefer that -pron- run with a little less leverage and have more capital to pursue accretive acquisition ipo edge spac have be raise large and large amount of money what s -pron- view on invest in a spac at the time of ipo mr greenberg -pron- do not like to invest in blind pool -pron- invest in company so -pron- approach be to wait until the spac identify a target and then decide sometimes ill put more money in if -pron- ne -pron- like -pron- do with repay in other case ill just go out and buy spac share in the market as -pron- do with clarivate ipo edge what do -pron- like about spac compare with ipo mr greenberg -pron- can get size with a spac in a regular ipo -pron- may get 5 million or 10 million in the allocation but then the stock may jump and -pron- will not want to buy any more since -pron- too expensive -pron- be often not able to establish a full position at a reasonable price a big advantage with a spac be that -pron- can invest more capital upfront at what -pron- believe be a reasonable price another advantage be there be more disclosure and more time to do due diligence -pron- can learn more about a spacs acquisition target see projection and communicate with management -pron- take advantage of the ability to meet these company and get to know -pron- well before invest ipo edge what s contribute to the success of spacs over time mr greenberg there have be an evolution these use to be 20 50 100 million raise -pron- be acquire flaky company and there be a big risk that the deal would not get approve also excess compensation be go to sponsor who do not play a role in the acquire company now -pron- have 300 400 500 million raise the sponsor be play a very significant role in the future of the company and be more reasonably compensate for -pron- role ipo edge get back to the repay deal what role do -pron- think warrant will play go forward mr greenberg warrant complicate financial structure and be dilutive there use to be two warrant issue per share then one -pron- have have deal do with less than one warrant and there be some in the market now with a quarter of a warrant which be a favorable development for new long term investor investor be not demand as many goody upfront as -pron- be in the past institutional buyer do not need as much incentive -pron- a positive that repay be able to retire a good portion of the warrant that be issue upon approval of the deal -pron- believe this will be emulate go forward and be a major positive steven heyer chief executive officer and executive chairman of haymaker acquisition corp ii spac ipo be get large and there be scope for a broad range of acquisition target but -pron- will remain critical to have a top notch operator a financial expert and a business plan that do not depend on too many promise that s accord to steven heyer a veteran business executive who bring onespaworld holdings ticker osw public as ceo of haymaker acquisition corp the health and wellness company which operate spa aboard major cruise line such as carnival and royal caribbean have be one of the most successful spac combination in recent year with the share trade nearly 70 high and more for those who keep warrant since the merger be announce steven heyer and -pron- brother andrew heyer who be president of haymaker have subsequently raise 400 million for haymaker acquisition corp ii which be currently search for another acquisition target the full interview be below steven heyer be chief executive officer and executive chairman of haymaker acquisition corp ii -pron- be also lead director of onespaworld holdings and serve as a director of lazard ltd and lazard group mr heyer have over 40 year of experience in the consumer and consumer related product and service industry lead a range of company and brand -pron- have apply -pron- leadership and analytical skill in a variety of leadership position across diverse industry group include broadcast medium consumer product along with hotel and leisure company mr heyer be the chief executive officer of starwood hotels resorts worldwide and president and chief operate officer of the coca cola company -pron- also be president and chief operate officer of turner broadcasting system inc and a member of aol time warners operating committee among other role -pron- be an advisor and director to and investor in several private company include startup and turnaround ipo edge what type of leadership quality be most important in a successful spac mr heyer the most successful spac should have a mix of an operator who can see the potential in a business and someone with the financial mind need to craft a deal -pron- really enjoy work with andy on haymaker and be do the same thing with haymaker ii -pron- have come to love -pron- even more ipo edge what kind of company make a good spac target mr heyer -pron- look for a good business that have both growth and free cash flow -pron- should be differentiate from the rest of the market with a wide moat around the business onespaworld have all of those feature and -pron- be able to get a deal do with a fabulous company -pron- have almost no redemption and great enthusiasm for the transaction ipo edge what be the reason to do a spac versus a traditional ipo mr heyer if the owner want to take significant money off the table immediately a spac be good -pron- also an opportunity for the owner to roll some of the investment to participate in the upside of a well perform stock however for a spac to succeed -pron- ne trust and motivation on both side that s how -pron- get a friendly fast negotiation with onespaworld ipo edge be there a size limitation for spac ipo what s help -pron- get big mr heyer -pron- raise 400 million for haymaker ii but -pron- could be a billion dollar the issue be that -pron- be probably look for a middle market deal so -pron- do not need that much in the spac ipo -pron- be not go to raise 5 billion with a more successful track record -pron- can attract investor who want to bet on -pron- team before the target be know ipo edge how have spac be perceive over the year mr heyer if -pron- go back 20 year spac be a dirty word the reason be that people be use -pron- to line -pron- pocket -pron- be be bad steward even recently -pron- have a handful of investor who have a knee jerk negative reaction to a spac because of that history but with more successful deal attitude be change -pron- evolve from be a niche vehicle to become a real asset class ipo edge -pron- talk about cash flow could a spac deal be do with a fast grow company that s not yet profitable mr heyer -pron- would do -pron- if the growth story be compelling enough and the potential for meaningful profit creation be clear the expectation need to be that the business can float on -pron- own and do not hinge on a dozen promise or flawless integration at some point -pron- stretch credibility phil denning partner icr inc spac deal be likely to expand into new industry such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get that s accord to phil denning partner and co head of icrs special situation group icr have advise on dozen of spac transaction include onespaworld haymaker acquisition corp repay holdings thunder bridge acquisition ltd and simply good foods company conyers park acquisition corp mr denning attribute much of the recent success in spacs to the presence of well regarded private equity firm that remain shareholder after deal close and take board seat to stay on as advisor -pron- also point out that spacs benefit from regulation that allow company to communicate very clearly with investor give guidance for metric such as revenue and ebitda something that s not allow with traditional ipo the full interview be below ipo edge what have be the main driver of the success of spacs in the last several month mr denning one key feature of many successful deal have be the presence of a well regarded private equity firm that have elect to keep a significant stake in the company after -pron- go public -pron- not only send the message that the private equity firm believe in the business but can be helpful as the company plot -pron- strategy move forward -pron- see that with both onespaworld which have l catterton as a shareholder and repay which have corsair capital as a shareholder the role of the private equity firm be generally to advise in the form of one or more board director but -pron- can also go with informal advisory role or even more formal such as an executive position create there have also be an element of creativity in recent deal that make -pron- succeed the repay deal would have close without the pipe investor but -pron- additional capital make the term even better because of the dilution that be eliminate -pron- think that the flexible nature of the product have foster creative thinking which have lead to success ipo edge warrant coverage have decrease in many recent deal with some as low as per share do -pron- believe that the warrant feature be likely to keep shrink or do some deal ne -pron- mr denning the warrant can be a great incentive to get investor into a spac ipo especially with a team that have a lot of potential but not a proven track record there be investor out there who really just buy into a deal to get the warrant and have no intention of keep the share and that s fine because -pron- help get the cash raise but the idea be to attract investor who believe enough in a management team that -pron- want to stick with the spac share and wind up own the target company -pron- will probably always need some warrant feature to keep investor incentiviz after all if -pron- be go to let -pron- cash sit in a trust account and just earn minimal interest -pron- ne a carrot there will be deal with very small fraction of a warrant those be go to be the spacs whose leadership have very strong track record for those new to the game a full warrant per share be probably go to remain the norm ipo edge do -pron- expect spacs to get even large in the next few year mr denning -pron- actually think that spac under a billion dollar be the ideal size if -pron- get much big the company be probably best suited to go the typical ipo route the reason why spac may do so well at the current size be that there s plethora of middle market target company own by private equity many of those private equity firm be in a difficult position because the company be not an ideal fit for an ipo mean -pron- can only rally be sell to a strategic or another private equity firm so spac have create an entirely new exit path and spac be more appealing than a straight sale because many private equity owner want to participate in further upside if -pron- sell the company to another firm -pron- obviously can not do that ipo edge what be the key advantage to go public via a spac rather than a traditional ipo mr denning one major advantage -pron- have observe relate to disclosure with a spac -pron- relatively easy to communicate a target companys growth plan once the deal be announce -pron- be able to show the investment community specific target for metric such as revenue and ebitda that -pron- can not with a traditional ipo that take a lot of guesswork out of the equation for potential investor another advantage from the perspective of a company owner be the ability to sell a large stake but also remain a significant holder with an ipo -pron- be really only sell a sliver of the company at the time of the deal spac can also happen much more quickly if -pron- raise money and find a target right away a deal can be do in a matter of month the ipo process be much more long and arduous ipo edge be there specific industry that be best suit for spac mr denning there have be a lot of success with consumer and consumer relate deal look back to hostess brands and more recently to onespaworld but -pron- think there be plenty of scope to grow in different industry just recently -pron- have a real estate
