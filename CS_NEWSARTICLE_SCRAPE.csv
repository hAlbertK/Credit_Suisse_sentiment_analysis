Micron reports fiscal fourth-quarter financial results after the market close. The chip giant is expected to report adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share on $4.56 billion in revenue, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Despite the fact that most semiconductor companies have been caught in the crosshairs of the more than yearlong U.S.-China trade war, Micron and the rest of the industry has managed to outperform the broader market this year.

Micron shares have rallied 55% this year, while the ETF tracking semiconductor stocks, SMH, jumped 38% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 20% in the same time period.

Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump addressed world leaders and mentioned that he had previously met with Micron CEO to chat about the difficulties chip companies are facing due to the trade war and tariffs.

Micron beat both on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal third quarter, and the stock soared on the results. Management said that if Huawei were to remain on the U.S. entity list through 2020, Micron would see an impact and that it would ultimately impact its revenue. According to the company, Chinese tech giant Huawei represented about 13% of Micron’s total sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019.

The options market is implying a 8% move in either direction for Micron stock following its earnings release.

“I don’t know if Nancy Pelosi is going to have any time to sign [the USMCA] — that’s the only problem,” said President Trump on Wednesday. He went on to say Pelosi is wasting time with a “manufactured crisis.”

Approving the new deal — known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) — before the end of the year has been one of the administration’s top priorities.

“If it happens, it happens. Otherwise, when we take over the House next year we’ll do it our way,” said Trump.

In a statement on Tuesday, the White House said Democratic lawmakers have “destroyed any chances” of legislative progress with the impeachment inquiry.

“They need to have an internal discussion at the White House about how they want to play it. Do you to want keep working with the Democrats or are you so mad that you don't want to work with them on anything? And I don't know if they decided that yet,” said Simon Lester, trade expert with the Cato Institute.

In contrast to Trump, Lighthizer appears to more optimistic about the deal’s chances.

“If it did not pass, it would be a catastrophe for our economy,” Lighthizer told reporters on Wednesday.

Lighthizer said he’s confident the agreement will make it through Congress, despite the inquiry, because he believes it’s a good deal.



""It's not all about politics in Washington. On the merits, this is demonstrably good for the people of the United States,” said Lighthizer, according to the White House press pool report.

A group of Democratic lawmakers has been working with Lighthizer for months, attempting to make changes to several areas of the deal — including environmental standards, labor standards, pharmaceuticals and enforcement. Democratic lawmakers insist they can still work on the trade deal, while investigating President Trump.

“The work continues between the administration and the leadership with the House. There’s still progress going on,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “To be fair, there are some good people in the federal government — people like Ambassador Lighthizer, who is the person with whom we're working on this — that want to get this done, is acting in good faith.”

Kildee said he’s not sure if Democratic negotiators and Lighthizer will eventually come up with an agreement that he could support, but the impeachment inquiry won’t stop them from trying.

“I don't think it's necessarily the end of USMCA. I think USMCA has bigger problems, unfortunately, than this [impeachment] and it's actually getting the language right,” said Kildee, who serves on the House Ways & Means committee.

Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point, said President Trump’s negotiating style makes it difficult to predict what will happen.

“On the one hand, the inquiry could fortify President Trump’s trade stance as he tends to retrench and redirect when attacked,” said Boltansky in a note. “On the other hand, the inquiry could cause the president to look for victories beyond the water’s edge to bolster his case for reelection. We tend to believe that the president’s posture will reflect the former in the near-term, but expect him to pivot toward the latter strategy as the election draws near.”

At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, a reporter asked President Trump if he would end NAFTA if USMCA doesn’t make it through Congress.

“I don't want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA. I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made,” Trump replied. “We’re gonna find out. That’s going to be a very interesting question.”"

Stocks would go up way more if Trump did one key thing: resign.

He probably won’t. Trump is obviously a fighter, and it’s not even clear impeachment proceedings will harm him. When the House impeached Bill Clinton in 1998, his popularity improved, largely because voters saw him as the victim of political overreach by Republicans. The same could happen to Trump.

But Trump is arguably in a tougher spot than Clinton, whose offense was lying about an extramarital affair under oath. Trump appears to have subordinated national security concerns to his personal political interests and used taxpayer aid money appropriated by Congress as a kind of bribe to goad Ukraine into digging up dirt on Joe Biden. Foreign policy and national security are core presidential responsibilities, and Trump may have badly abused his power.

Trump could probably survive impeachment, assuming the majority of Republicans in the Senate would vote not to convict him. But this is treacherous terrain for Trump. Republican senators might not be as averse to a conviction as some might think. If the Senate did convict Trump and he left office, they wouldn’t be handing the presidency to Democrats. They’d be trading Trump for Vice President Mike Pence, who would become president. If able to do that in one fell swoop, the many Republican senators who supposedly revile Trump in private might just go for it.

Trump could also choose to resign because he concludes he can’t win in 2020, and would rather quit than lose. It’s also possible Trump could choose to leave so Pence can pardon him, rather than risk defeat in November. There’s evidence in the Mueller report and elsewhere that Trump committed campaign finance felonies in 2016 and possibly obstruction of justice when he was president. Once he leaves office, Trump is vulnerable to prosecution, and there’s no guarantee that a Democrat would pardon him.

How would markets react?

So if Trump resigned, how would stock markets react? Euphorically. From a business perspective, the best of the Trump agenda—tax cuts and deregulation—would remain in place. But the worst of the Trump agenda—tariffs, protectionism, xenophobia and political interference with the free market—would dissipate. It might take a couple hours for markets to sort it out, but replacing Trump with Pence would almost certainly cheer investors.

Before he was a Trump yes-man, Pence was a more traditional Republican, supportive of free trade and limited government. He probably wouldn’t abandon everything Trump stands for, but he’d probably ditch the worst of it, including:

Tariffs. Trump is almost alone among Republicans in his crusade to wall off the U.S. economy, cut down on trade and punish trading partners with tariffs—which also hurt the U.S. economy. Pence might look for other ways to keep the pressure on China, such as coordinating with allies to reform the World Trade Organization. But it’s hard to imagine he or any other Republican would keep the Trump tariffs in place at the levels they’re at now. This is the single-biggest policy cloud hanging over markets, which would rally if the clouds parted.

Immigration. A tough stance on illegal immigration is popular among conservatives, but Pence could ease up on legal immigration and raise quotas or find other ways to let more people legally migrate to the United States. Many economists say we need more legal immigration, not less, to deal with labor shortages, boost entrepreneurship and expand a labor force that must finance Social Security and Medicare for the baby boomers. Pence would probably be friendlier to immigrants than Trump has been. Anybody, actually, would be friendlier to immigrants than Trump has been."

BlackBerry’s Internet-of-Things (IoT) division and Cylance cyber security unit both missed consensus estimates and contributed to the miss, according to analysts. Shares of the Waterloo, Ontario-based company fell the most since Jan. 2015 to the lowest since Oct. 2015 on a full day’s worth of volume in the first five minutes of U.S. trading.

RBC analyst Paul Treiber said the company’s IP revenue was “well above” RBC and Street estimates, but “strong IP licensing revenue doesn’t offset IoT and Cylance shortfall”. Raymond James analyst Steven Li agreed and said that BlackBerry’s enterprise software group “significantly underperformed” during its fiscal second quarter.

The company’s shares also tumbled during last quarter’s earnings results as sales from software and services slowed and a recent acquisition contributed less of a boost than some analysts expected.

His Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. lost more than C$160 million ($121 million) just in his top five listed Canadian investments, according to the latest filings compiled by Bloomberg.

BlackBerry’s abysmal fiscal second-quarter earnings, which saw one of its staunchest bulls join the bear camp, was the prime offender. The stock fell 23% on Tuesday and extended declines Wednesday to the lowest in six years.

To add to the pressure, Fairfax owns BlackBerry convertible debentures. The risk of default over the next year on the C$800 million of BlackBerry debt rose to 0.1% on Tuesday from a previous estimate of 0.021%, according to the Bloomberg Default Risk Model.

The second biggest culprit was Stelco Holdings Inc., which slumped 12% on Tuesday after it terminated a $300 million high-yield bond sale, citing poor steel-market conditions. The stock was down another 1.7% Wednesday.

Including today’s sell-off, Fairfax would have lost about C$196 million on its top five Canadian investments from the end of trade on Monday.

“Since we started in 1985, we always take a long-term view and we believe these recent price moves are short-term fluctuations on only a few of our stock holdings,” Paul Rivett, Fairfax president, said by email. “It is also worth mentioning that half of our Blackberry position is in a convertible debenture.”

Turns out part of the solution was sitting in the ground and under ocean floors all the while: crude oil.

Oil from off the U.K.’s coast, which requires blending -- but no refining -- before being used as a ship fuel, is now being marketed as just that. Similar crudes from places like West Africa and Australia can also be used with little modification. Suitable supplies are ideally low in sulfur and not too flammable.

Using crude to power vessels isn’t entirely new. Back in the 1980s, oil tanker owners would illicitly run pipes from their vessels’ cargo tanks to their engines, according to Per Mansson, a retired merchant seaman and shipbroker. Provided the engineers on the ships were experienced and knew how to deal with the combustibility of the crude -- known as its flash point -- it was a safe operation, he said.

What’s happening now is different. Certain crudes can go -- almost directly -- into vessels’ fuel tanks with very little adjustment. It all depends on a few key parameters, including sulfur content and density of the oil, and how flammable or combustible it is. Rather than going to a refinery, such grades can simply be blended with other products to make something suitable for powering ships.

The U.K. grade that fits the bill is called Kraken — pumped from a field in the North Sea operated by EnQuest Plc. Its sulfur content is a little over the 0.5% required under new ship fuel rules, and it will only ignite at a high temperature, making it potentially good for ship fuel.

Positive Feedback

“A cargo has already been sold to a ship owner and thus we remain very optimistic regarding Kraken’s utility in this market,” says Russell Wall, a commercial and marketing manager at EnQuest. “We have received positive market feedback.”

That shipment was bought by Euronav NV, which plans to use the crude as part of a mix to produce fuel that complies with next year’s rules. The barrels are part of a massive 420,000 ton cargo being hauled to the Singapore area by one of the biggest oil tankers on the planet, the Oceania.

Traders looking for suitable crudes from which to make ship fuels will typically prefer those that are dense, low in sulfur, and have a high flash-point, said Cosmo Kedros, a senior trading specialist at Vortexa, a shipping analytics firm.

“Shipowners are highly motivated by price and not messing up their engines,” he said. “If they have the infrastructure and the capital to blend their own bunkers -- whether with heavy crudes or not -- they should consider doing it.”

Heavy Sweets

Hotbeds of so-called heavy-sweet crudes -- which represent a small portion of the market -- include West Africa, Australia and Brazil. Australian grades have traded more than $10 a barrel above Brent this year, around a fourfold increase versus two years ago.

Different types of crudes will be blended in particular ways to meet the marine fuel specification. Kraken, for instance, contains slightly too much sulfur. The Republic of the Congo’s Yombo, on the other hand, is low enough in sulfur but is very viscous, or thick.

Other crudes simply need to be ""topped,"" one of the simplest refining processes where the raw oil is heated until the lighter components are burned off. What remains, with its higher flash point, can in some cases then be used to make ship-fuel.

There are other challenges, too. Anybody looking to buy crude for blending into a marine fuel will have to compete with a normal refinery that wants to turn that oil into other products like gasoline and diesel. With no certainty on the future price of shipping fuel -- or other products for that matter -- it’s hard to say which will be more profitable in 2020 and so to what extent crudes will be used as vessel fuel ingredients.

As the world’s shippers gear up for IMO 2020 -- the name of the regulations forcing reduced sulfur emissions -- an armada of supertankers being used to store oil has built up off the coast of Singapore, according to Vortexa. Though the ships are filled with a mix of products, they do hold some crude, showing that it may well have a future as a ship fuel. The giant Oceania will also soon join their ranks.

At the same time, things don't always work out as planned, or at least not right away.

That's why, when looking for stocks that Wall Street has supreme confidence in, we need to add a bit of secret sauce to our stock screening, and protect our investment by ensuring that even if a stock does not go up, we still get paid.

How do we do that in practice? By screening for stocks highly recommended by professional analysts (""strong buy""), expected to deliver powerful profits (with ""target prices"" 20% or more above today's price) -- and also paying an above-market dividend yield.

Fortunately, the Stock Screener at TipRanks permits you to do all three of these things at once. Here are three such strong buy-rated suggestions we recently came across.

General Motors: 30.53% Upside, 4.1% Dividend Yield

General Motors (GM – Get Report) stock has been getting a lot of bad press of late, now that the United Auto Workers (UAW) union has called its first strike against the company in more than a decade. And yet, in a recent note, 4-star Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas supported the stock, arguing that GM is in a better financial condition to survive a strike that it's been in the past.

""While the situation remains fluid and can weigh on the shares short term, we strongly believe labor/strike disruption presents an excellent buying opportunity for GM shares,"" Jonas noted.

Barclays analyst Brian Johnson added, ""While the UAW has plenty in reserves to fund an extended strike (albeit, with workers receiving significantly less than their normal compensation) our base case is that the walk-out is more of a token strike meant to convey a message to General Motors and the industry, vs a more prolonged event.""

Both Jonas and Johnson reiterated an Overweight rating on GM stock with price targets of $51 and $46, respectively. (To watch the analysts' track records, click here)

Even sitting here on the wrong side of the automotive cycle, GM held its sales decline to less than 2% last quarter -- and its profits actually increased 1%!

On average, Street analysts predict GM shares could rise as much as 30.53% over the next 12 months, and with a dividend yield of 4.1%, we agree that GM stock looks attractive.

Nutrien: 26% Upside, 3.6% Dividend yield

Another stock facing negative headlines is Nutrien (NTR – Get Report), one the world's biggest players in the production and sale of potash, nitrogen, and phosphate fertilizers.

America's long, wet spring made it hard for farmers to get crops in the ground in time to enjoy a full growing season, and as a result, the fields here in the Midwest today are mostly populated with stalks of awfully short-looking corn. That bodes poorly for farmers come harvest-time -- and for their ability to invest heavily in fertilizers and agricultural equipment for next year's crop. On the other hand, they may not have much choice but to fertilize in 2020 if they're to make up for crop shortfalls in 2019.

Last month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Byrne upgraded shares of Nutrien on the belief that agriculture stocks such as Nutrien could make for good defensive plays if the economy turns south. But defense isn't the only way to play Nutrien. In fact, on average, most analysts who look at the stock see a potential target price as much as 26% above where Nutrien stock trades today. With the stock trading for less than 10 times trailing earnings, and paying a rich 3.6% dividend yield, that looks like a smart call. (See NTR's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)

By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson

DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is scheduled to join United Auto Workers members on a picket line in Detroit on Wednesday, underscoring the extent to which the longest auto worker strike in nearly 30 years has become a political event.

The U.S. senator from Vermont, an independent, joins a parade of Democrats who have met with some of the 48,000 striking hourly workers, using the walkout against General Motors Co <GM.N> to amplify their messages about income inequality and corporate power. Their oratory comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's vows to protect U.S. manufacturing jobs with tariffs on imported cars, and his frequent criticism of GM for shutting UAW-represented factories in Ohio and Michigan.

GM workers went on strike on Sept. 16, seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of GM's profit and protection of their healthcare benefits. Talks between the two sides continued on Tuesday.

The politicians' appearances at plants throughout the Midwest over the past week emphasize the importance of the UAW to winning in states that will be pivotal to the 2020 presidential election.

In 2016, Republican Trump convinced numerous UAW members to vote for him, helping him win Michigan, Ohio and other states. The UAW has traditionally supported Democratic candidates. The union and its members contributed almost $16 million during the 2012 election cycle when former President Barack Obama was re-elected, making it one of the most politically active groups tracked by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. However, UAW contributions dropped to less than $5.8 million in 2016.

UAW workers gave Trump a higher than normal share of their votes in 2016 - 32% of the almost 400,000 members by the union's reckoning.

""He is president because of this group of voters,"" Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said of blue-collar workers in the Midwest. ""The strike has become a symbol for how the U.S. might compete in the global economy.""

UAW officials are not commenting publicly about the visits, but they are closely watching the 2020 candidates to see who is most involved with the strike effort as an audition for winning the union's support.

On Sunday outside a GM plant in Kansas City, Kansas, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said, ""There used to be a basic deal in the old days. If you contributed to the welfare of the corporation you worked for, you got to share in the benefit ... That's not the deal anymore.

""We didn’t bail out GM, the UAW bailed out GM,"" he told the striking workers. ""You gave up more than anybody. That's why GM made it.""

In Detroit on the same day, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, credited unions with building the middle class in America, but said the middle class was now under attack.

""GM is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or to the people of America,"" she told striking workers outside GM's Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. ""Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.""

Other Democratic candidates who have visited striking workers include U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar and U.S. Representative Tim Ryan. Former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke is visiting UAW members in West Chester, Ohio, on Tuesday and Lordstown, Ohio, on Wednesday.





GM REJECTS CRITICISM

The White House has said it is not involved in the talks, but Trump has repeatedly demanded GM find a new vehicle for its now-shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown. That region in the northeastern part of the state historically supported Democrats in presidential races but backed Trump in 2016.

Democratic candidates and labor leaders have blasted GM's decision to stop paying healthcare benefits for striking UAW workers. The union's strike fund is supposed to pay for coverage during a walkout.

GM officials have tried to counter charges that they are abandoning U.S. workers, releasing details of an offer to the UAW that included the promise of investing $7 billion in U.S. plants, annual raises in a new four-year deal, increased profit sharing and retention of existing healthcare insurance.

DETROIT (AP) — Contract talks between General Motors and striking United Auto Workers took a step closer to reaching an agreement Wednesday when committees finished their work and sent it to the top bargainers.

The move means that minor issues largely are resolved, and a few bargainers for both sides will now try to come to terms on wages, use of temporary workers and other contentious issues.

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes outlined the development in a letter to members. He says the union presented material to GM and is waiting for a response.

""This back and forth will continue until negotiations are complete,"" Dittes wrote. ""We will continue to bargain this contract until your Bargaining Committee is satisfied that we have achieved an agreement that properly addresses our members' concerns.""

In a statement, GM spokesman Dan Flores said the company will ""continue to bargain in good faith, and our goal remains to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company.""

Art Schwartz, a former GM negotiator who now runs a labor consulting business in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said shifting work to the main table is a good sign. But it's tough to say how far apart both sides are on the major economic issues, he said.

""It kind of depends on how hard each side holds out. Collective bargaining is the art of compromise,"" he said. ""This is probably a couple people from each side are going to hammer out the final economics."" Schwartz said.

The strike by about 49,000 workers, in its 10th day, has halted production at more than 30 GM factories nationwide.

Both sides are losing money, with one analyst estimating the strike costs GM $100 million in profits per day. Workers, on the other hand, got their last GM paycheck last Friday and are scheduled to get $250 in weekly strike pay starting this Friday.

GM has been forced to close one Canadian factory and lay off workers at another. Its dealers also are starting to run short of repair parts at their service centers. Companies that make parts for factories also are starting to lay off workers. Canadian supplier Magna International said it has laid off an unspecified number of employees."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening.

The news adds another item to the list of uncertainties investors will have to worry about. So what does this mean for stocks?

“For equities, remember we’ve seen something like this twice and had two very different results,” Renaissance Macro’s Neil Dutta noted in an email. “During the [President Richard] Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started. During the [President Bill] Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed.”

“Perhaps these political events are eventually overwhelmed by the fundamentals?” Dutta asked rhetorically.

On one hand, the historical sample size is very small. On the other hand, you could argue that no one president is bigger than the pistons powering the economy.

Citi Private Bank strategists circulated the annotated charts above in a note to clients noting “the US stock market performed in line with the prevailing fundamentals of the time.” (Citi Private Bank) More

The Nixon experience is notable because stocks took an unambiguous plunge. But as JPMorgan’s John Normand noted in an August 2018 note to clients: “These were extraordinary times, however, with or without domestic politics. The Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was in the process of disintegrating due to US balance of payments stress and Nixon’s decision to suspend the dollar’s convertibility into gold — and devalue the currency — in 1971. Hence the dollar’s erratic swings and gold’s rally during this period. The First Oil Shock in late 1973 delivered both recession and rising inflation in 1974, and thus a stagflation-driven sell-off in Equities and Bonds.”

In other words, there were other forces moving markets.

The Clinton experience is interesting as well because the stock market got slammed before the impeachment proceedings, as Normand notes, “due the previous months’ traumas from the Asian Crisis, Russian default and LTCM collapse.” From there, investors were too busy riding up the dot-com boom to be distracted by turmoil in D.C.

Nixon resigned after the impeachment hearings began. Clinton was impeached by the House, but was later acquitted by the Senate.

The takeaway is that each instance was very different and it’s probably safe to say this time is different. But what’s clear is that over time, the stock market has ultimately reflected what’s been going on in the economy, not the White House.

The US president accused Democrats of another political ""witch hunt"", and previewed his defence in an all-caps tweet: ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"".

The impeachment inquiry, after months of investigations by House Democrats of the Trump administration, sets up the party's most direct and consequential confrontation with the president, injects deep uncertainty into the 2020 election campaign and tests anew the nation's constitutional system of checks and balances.

So what happens next?

What are the allegations against Donald Trump?

A whistleblower in the US intelligence community has made an internal complaint.

He - it is a man - alleges that Mr Trump, in a July 25 phone call, urged the leader of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Why have the Democrats launched impeachment proceedings?

The Democrats claim Mr Trump's alleged actions show he violated the Constitution by inviting help from a foreign power in a domestic election.

What is impeachment?

Impeachment is a process by which senior US executive officials, including the president and vice-president, can be removed from office for abuses.

It is part of the system of checks and balances set out in the Constitution.

The House of Representatives has the sole power to launch impeachment proceedings. That can ultimately lead to the US senate hosting a trial of the president. How far has the process gone so far?

Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat speaker of the House, on Tuesday announced a formal impeachment inquiry.

Six Democrat-led House committees have already been carrying out various ad hoc investigations of Mr Trump.

Those will now be gathered under the umbrella of one formal impeachment inquiry, conducted by the House judiciary committee.

The judiciary committee will then decide if there are grounds for impeachment. Only a simple majority on the judiciary committee is needed to go ahead.

If there is a majority, the judiciary committee will draw up articles of impeachment, essentially formal charges against the president.

The articles would then be passed to the full House, which debates and votes. Again, only a simple majority is needed, on each article. The Democrats are in the majority in the House.

What happens if the House votes to impeach?

The articles of impeachment then form the basis of a trial in the senate. Mr Trump would stand trial.

Would Mr Trump be convicted?

That is the big question. A two thirds ""supermajority"" is needed in the 100-member senate to convict. If convicted Mr Trump would be removed from office.

But Republicans are in the majority in the Senate. It would take a significant number of Republican senators to vote with the Democrats to convict Mr Trump.

How many other presidents have been impeached?

Certainly two - Andrew Johnson in the 19th Century, and Bill Clinton.

There is debate over whether Richard Nixon was impeached. The committee voted to send articles of impeachment to the full House. But Mr Nixon resigned before there was a full House vote.

By Jan Wolfe

(Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives made headlines by formally launching an impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, but there is debate among experts about the significance of the announcement.

The following explains the nature of the investigation and how the televised announcement made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may move the process forward.





What led to Tuesday's announcement?

The House move followed Trump's admission on Tuesday that he encouraged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner in the 2020 presidential election.

""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.""

Trump says that call was perfectly acceptable, and that he did not pressure the Ukrainian president.





Weren't Democrats already conducting a kind of impeachment investigation?

Yes. The House Judiciary Committee has been investigating whether to bring charges, known as articles of impeachment, against Trump. The House's Democratic leadership has been cagey about whether that amounted to an actual impeachment investigation, however.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerold Nadler said in a Sept. 13 appearance on CNN that the probe could be described as an impeachment investigation but added that was a ""made-up term"" and that he was ""not interested in the nomenclature."" Other party leaders have said an impeachment investigation was not underway.

Five other committees have been conducting their own investigations relating to Trump, including probes into his finances and his campaign's contacts with Russia.

The investigations, which Trump has called ""presidential harassment,"" have moved slowly due to court battles over access to witnesses and documents.





So how does Pelosi's announcement change things?

Pelosi put a new label on the various investigations and, perhaps more importantly, erased any doubt that Democrats were pursuing impeachment.

""I’m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,"" she said in her address.

The announcement moves the House closer to drafting articles of impeachment against Trump, according to Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri who has written a book about impeachment.

Pelosi has long opposed impeachment as a politically risky move unless investigators find powerful evidence of misconduct that can unify public opinion. Tuesday's address seemed to put her seal of approval on the process.

""As majority leader, she has the de facto if not the legal power to keep the Judiciary Committee or any other committee from driving full bore toward impeachment,"" said Bowman. ""That is the reality of the hierarchy of the House.""

Other impeachment experts said little has changed, however.

The announcement ""was basically a press event with little or no practical or legal significance,"" said Ross Garber, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in impeachment proceedings.

""The House has not passed a resolution,"" Garber said. ""No new powers were conferred on any committee. No new resources were allocated.""





What else might the announcement mean?

Past court decisions make clear that Congress has a stronger claim to documents and testimony when it is conducting an impeachment investigation, rather than asserting its traditional oversight powers, Bowman said. That means Pelosi's announcement could help the House win its pending court battles with Trump.

Trump's lawyers argue in those lawsuits that the congressional investigations are just partisan attempts to make him look bad, so he does not need to produce witnesses and documents.

The Trump administration is also asserting that some information sought by Congress is protected by ""executive privilege,"" a legal doctrine that allows the president to keep secret the nature of communications with advisers.

By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen

(Reuters) - WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann agreed on Tuesday to resign as CEO and give up majority voting control, after SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T> and other shareholders turned on him over a plunge in the U.S. office-sharing start-up's estimated valuation.

Neumann's dramatic fall from grace came after WeWork parent We Company postponed its initial public offering last week following push-back from prospective investors in its stock, not just over its widening losses but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.

This was a blow for SoftBank, which was hoping for We Company's IPO to bolster its fortunes as it seeks to woo investors for its second giant Vision Fund, totaling $108 billion.

SoftBank invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January. But investor skepticism led to We Company considering earlier this month a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.

We Company had vowed to press ahead with an IPO by the end of the year. But there was little sign that IPO investor sentiment would change, threatening the value of the stakes held not just by outside investors, but by Neumann as well.

What was the venture capital world's biggest upset then morphed into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.

SoftBank managed to muster enough opposition to Neumann in a meeting of We Company's seven-member board on Tuesday to convince him to step down. Reuters had reported on Monday that Neumann had engaged in talks about changes to his role.

""In recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,"" Neumann said in a statement.

Artie Minson, currently chief financial officer of We Company, and Sebastian Gunningham, a vice chairman for the New York-based start-up, will become co-chief executives, the company said. Neumann will stay on the board as non-executive chairman, the company added.

Minson, a former chief financial officer of Time Warner Cable who joined We Company in 2015, will oversee its finance, legal, human resources, real estate and public communications. Gunningham, a former executive at Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Oracle Corp <ORCL.N> who joined We Company last year, will take responsibility for product, design, development, sales, marketing, technology and regional teams.

We Company is considering slowing its expansion so it burns through less cash and would require less funding in the absence of an IPO in the near team, Reuters reported on Monday. The company is also contemplating laying off staff, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.

""While we anticipate difficult decisions ahead, each decision will be made with rigorous analysis, always bearing in mind the company's long-term interests and health,"" Minson and Gunningham wrote in an internal company memo seen by Reuters.

Neumann also agreed to reduce the power of his voting shares, losing majority voting control, according to the sources. Each of his shares will now have the same voting rights as three We Company common shares, not the 10 common shares previously, the sources said.

Neumann's shares used to have the same voting power as 20 We Company common shares, before he agreed to reduce his grip slightly earlier this month in an unsuccessful attempt to make the IPO more attractive to investors.

Neumann's wife Rebekah also found herself without a job at We Company as part of the changes, one of the sources said. She was co-chief brand and impact officer.

She is also the founder and CEO of WeGrow, an elementary school set up by We Company. However, We Company has decided to do away with such ventures that are not core to the WeWork brand, the source added. We Company declined to comment on Rebekah Neumann's role.

We Company said on Tuesday it was now evaluating the ""optimal timing"" for an IPO.





FIRM GRIP

Neumann, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $2.2 billion, developed a cult following among many We Company employees, vowing to ""elevate the world's consciousness"" as he sought to establish WeWork as a brand that transcended office sharing.

Now that he’s resigned -- and WeWork’s new co-CEOs are looking to make changes -- scrutiny is turning to his inner circle.

WeWork Vice Chairman Michael Gross, Vice President of Operations and Special Projects Zvika Shachar and Director of Development Roni Bahar are longtime WeWork executives who were seen internally as divisive figures with strong personal connections to the former CEO, according to current and former employees. Shachar is a childhood friend of Neumann, and Gross helped lead some of WeWork’s early fundraising rounds.

After Tuesday’s shakeup, and with an initial public offering delayed, WeWork’s new leaders are turning a critical eye on the company. “We will closely review all aspects of our company with the intention of strengthening our core business and improving our management and operations,” co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham wrote in an email to employees. “We anticipate difficult decisions ahead.”

The increased attention will include examining the roles of some of Neumann’s close associates, said two of the employees, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. WeWork declined to comment.

Read more about WeWork’s new leaders here.

Within WeWork’s fast and loose culture, where tequila shots sometimes flowed after all-hands meetings, the three confidants often partied with Neumann in work settings and beyond, according to the employees.

The employees said Shachar and Bahar flew with Neumann on a Gulfstream private jet last year when the crew found marijuana hidden in a cereal box on the plane, an episode reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. Shachar and Bahar did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

WeWork also paid Gross’s parents as brokers on a deal for a building in Miami, the two employees also said. Gross did not respond to a request for comment.

WeWork’s IPO, through which it hoped to raise $3 billion and access $6 billion more in credit, went up in flames this month over concern about the company’s valuation, its unusual corporate governance, and Neumann’s management style and personal behavior. His ouster mirrors that of Travis Kalanick, who was Uber’s famously aggressive co-founder and CEO until he was forced out by the board ahead of a public listing. Some of Kalanick’s close associates left around the time he stepped down in 2017.

WeWork is continuing to work toward an IPO, though it is likely postponed until 2020, according to people familiar with the matter. As part of its efforts to salvage the offering, the company is weighing job cuts and shedding or spinning out non-core businesses, those people said. Eliminated positions would number in the thousands, one person said.

By Mike Spector and David Shepardson

Sept 24 (Reuters) - A senior manager at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV was criminally charged in connection with a U.S. Justice Department probe into excess emissions in diesel-powered vehicles, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday.

Emanuele Palma, a diesel drivability and emissions senior manager at Fiat Chrysler, faces charges of conspiracy, fraud, violating federal environmental law and making false statements stemming from work on Fiat Chrysler's emissions system in U.S. vehicles with diesel engines, according to the indictment, handed up by a grand jury Sept. 18 and sealed until now.

Palma was arrested by the FBI at his residence in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, without incident this morning, and faces a 1 p.m. EDT (1800GMT) court hearing on Tuesday, a Justice Department spokesman said.

Lawyers for Palma could not immediately be identified from the legal documents. Prior to 2016, Palma worked for VM Motori SpA, a diesel engine manufacturer that was 50% owned by Fiat Chrysler until 2013, when it purchased the remainder of the company.

Fiat Chrysler said in a statement Tuesday morning it was ""just learning about details of the matter. We will continue to cooperate fully with authorities.""

The developments in the U.S. criminal probe signal additional scrutiny of Fiat Chrysler's environmental practices remains on the horizon, despite the automaker's January settlement of civil claims stemming from the alleged emissions violations.

Fiat Chrysler agreed to pay about $800 million to resolve civil claims from the Justice Department, state officials and customers alleging the company installed illegal software allowing more than 100,000 diesel-powered vehicles to dupe government emissions tests and then pollute beyond legal limits on the road.

The settlement did not resolve any potential criminal liability, the Justice Department said when unveiling the agreement.

Fiat Chrysler at the time said the settlement did not change the company's ""position that it did not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat emissions tests.""

The renewed focus from U.S. prosecutors on Fiat Chrysler's alleged emissions violations follows cases against Volkswagen AG and a number of that automaker's current and former executives over use of illegal software to fool government diesel-emissions tests and mislead regulators and consumers.

Volkswagen and some of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the scandal, and the German automaker paid billions of dollars in penalties.

German prosecutors on Tuesday charged former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn and other company executives in the scandal. A Winterkorn lawyer said the former CEO rejected the claims. He was previously charged in the United States.

The indictment unsealed Tuesday says Palma and unnamed co-conspirators ""purposefully calibrated the emissions control system"" in Fiat Chrysler vehicles to produce lower emissions under federal test cycles and release higher amounts of nitrogen oxides during real world driving conditions. They concealed the those moves from U.S. environmental regulators, the indictment alleged.

The alleged fraud allowed Palma and the unnamed co-conspirators to obtain a favorable fuel economy rating that made Fiat Chrysler vehicles more attractive to potential customers, the indictment said. Prosecutors alleged the conduct resulted in deceptive claims to customers that the vehicles featured ""clean EcoDiesel engines,"" the indictment said.

Washington (AFP) - A senior manager at Fiat Chrysler has been charged with misleading US environmental regulators in the scandal over the automaker's use of ""defeat devices"" to evade emissions tests, the US Justice Department announced Tuesday.

The company in January agreed to pay more than $500 million to settle the charges it intentionally manipulated software to allow its vehicles to spew more pollutants than allowed by law, and recalled 100,000 diesel vehicles sold in the United States.

The Justice Department said in a statement that it charged Emanuele Palma, 40, an Italian citizen and resident of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, for ""his alleged role in a conspiracy to mislead US regulators, customers and the public by making false and misleading statements.""

Palma, resident of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, led a team of engineers in the United States responsible for developing and calibrating the 3.0-liter diesel engine used in certain FCA diesel vehicles, and adjusted the software to allow them to pass tests, the statement said.

US officials have said the FCA's EcoDiesel Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee for model years 2014-2016 were built with software designed to operate differently during emissions tests compared with real-world conditions.

Palma ""is alleged to have knowingly misled EPA regulators to cover up illegal emissions control software installed in certain Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles,"" said Susan Bodine of the Environmental Protection Agency.

A spokesman for the group in Italy told AFP: ""We're just learning about the details of the matter.... We will continue to collaborate fully with the authorities.""

The emissions scandal which started with Volkswagen has engulfed many automakers, including Daimler and BMW."

By Mike Spector and David Shepardson

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A grand jury indicted a senior manager at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) <FCHA.MI> on charges he lied to regulators about diesel emissions, alleging the deception continued even after a scandal over cheating on government environmental tests had engulfed rival Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE>.

The indictment of the Fiat Chrysler manager, unsealed Tuesday, said others ""known and unknown"" to the grand jury also criminally conspired to mislead regulators and customers about emissions in diesel-powered vehicles, a scheme they described in emails seized upon by U.S. Justice Department officials.

The charges came on the same day that prosecutors in Germany indicted Volkswagen's current and former CEOs and the company's board chairman on charges they failed to inform investors of that company's diesel-emissions fraud after they learned of it in 2015. Also on Tuesday, German automaker Daimler AG agreed to pay 870 million euros in fines connected to a separate investigation of diesel emissions cheating.

Emanuele Palma, a senior manager of diesel drivability and emissions at Fiat Chrysler, faces charges of conspiracy, fraud, violating federal environmental law and making false statements stemming from work on Fiat Chrysler's emissions system in U.S. vehicles with diesel engines, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday.

Palma, a 40-year-old Italian citizen, was arrested by the FBI Tuesday morning at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In the afternoon, he appeared before a federal judge in Detroit in shackles, a hooded sweatshirt and sweatpants. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford released him on a $10,000 unsecured bond and ordered him to surrender his passport.

Prosecutors argued Palma represented a ""significant flight risk"" and sought unsuccessfully to have him placed under GPS monitoring. Palma's lawyer, Kenneth Mogill, argued his client has family in the Detroit area and is cooperating with prosecutors.

The indictment describes what it refers to as a ""scheme"" to use sophisticated software tricks to deceive regulators about the emissions performance of diesel engines offered in Ram pickup trucks and Jeep sport-utility vehicles.

Palma led a team of engineers who developed diesel engines and calibrated them with software allowing the vehicles to pollute less when undergoing government testing and more when driven on roads, U.S. officials said.

After the disclosure of Volkswagen's emissions fraud in September 2015, the indictment states that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asked Fiat Chrysler for more testing of its diesel vehicles. In November 2015, the EPA warned Fiat Chrysler that it suspected some of its vehicles were using secret software to defeat emissions tests.

The indictment charges that months later, in a June 2016 meeting, Palma ""personally provided false and misleading representations"" to regulators.

Before 2016, Palma worked for VM Motori SpA, a diesel engine manufacturer that was 50% owned by Fiat Chrysler until 2013, when it purchased the remainder of the company.

Fiat Chrysler, which has previously denied purposefully attempting to evade emissions requirements, said in a statement it would ""continue to fully cooperate with the authorities, as we have throughout this issue"" and declined to comment further.

""The indictment in this case should signal to corporations and individuals working for them that there are significant consequences for attempting to bypass U.S. emissions tests and defraud the American people,” said Special Agent in Charge Steven M. D'Antuono of the FBI’s Detroit Field Office in statement.

Fiat Chrysler's U.S.-listed shares <FCAU.N> lost 3 percent to $13 on Tuesday. Milan-listed shared closed down 2 percent.





SETTLED CIVIL CLAIMS

The developments in the U.S. criminal probe signal additional scrutiny of Fiat Chrysler's environmental practices on the horizon, despite the automaker's January settlement of civil claims stemming from the alleged emissions violations.

Fiat Chrysler agreed to pay about $800 million to resolve civil claims from the Justice Department, state officials and customers alleging the company installed illegal software allowing more than 100,000 diesel-powered vehicles to dupe government emissions tests and then pollute beyond legal limits on the road.

For years, he convinced private investors that WeWork, a company that leases space from landlords, renovates it, slices it up into offices, and rents them out at a premium, was worth more than every other office-rental company. It was Neumann’s charisma, conviction, and unfettered ambition—he has spoken about WeWork Mars, running for president of the world, and becoming the first trillionaire—that built WeWork into one of the world’s most valuable startups, with operations spanning 111 cities in 29 countries.

Then, in August, WeWork filed for an initial public offering, and in doing so exposed a raft of curious and troubling details about the inner workings of the company, which rebranded earlier this year as The We Company, or We.

Some, like the $900 million WeWork lost in the first half of 2019 and the outsized control co-founder Neumann wielded, were par for the course for a buzzy private technology company these days. Others, like rampant self-dealing—Neumann owned several properties he leased back to the company, received personal loans and a credit line secured by his WeWork stock, and sold the trademark to “We” to the company for $5.9 million when it rebranded—shocked even jaded startup observers.

Further reporting revealed Neumann’s very un-CEO-like conduct: how he smoked marijuana on a transatlantic private jet flight, handed out trays of tequila shots after mass layoffs, and made impulsive, sweeping decisions like a company-wide ban on meat with little to no rationale.

Last week, WeWork shelved its IPO after reports that the company’s valuation could fall as low as $10 billion, a dramatic plunge from its last private valuation of $47 billion. But the final blow came today, when WeWork said Neumann was stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. Neumann will stay on as non-executive chairman of the board, while two top internal executives—Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham—become co-CEOs.

“While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,” Neumann said in a statement.

Neumann has lost more than a title. The Wall Street Journal reported that he is also ceding majority control of the company, with his voting power slashed to 3 votes per share, down from 10. (His voting rights were previously reduced to 10 votes per share from 20 in WeWork’s initial IPO filing.) He has lost the backing of Softbank, WeWork’s biggest cheerleader and investor, which began calling for his ouster over the weekend. He may even have lost a $500 million line of credit, provided by the banks underwriting WeWork’s IPO and secured by his own shares.

Travis 2.0

The stunning rise and fall of Neumann echoes the trajectory of Travis Kalanick, the brash co-founder of Uber who built a multibillion-dollar company and then was pushed out by his board in 2017, amid multiple sexual harassment scandals and federal probes into the company’s conduct. Once the full extent of mismanagement at Uber and WeWork became clear, investors and the public were quick to turn against both Kalanick and Neumann. But before it all came out—the scandals, the self-dealing, the wildly inappropriate conduct—those same investors embraced the co-founders for their vision and audacity.

Arrogance, ambition, a blatant disregard for the rules, and fondness for “pissing people off” cost Kalanick his job. It also made Uber great. Boldness, grandiosity, zeal, and ambition bordering on megalomania convinced many people to invest in Neumann’s WeWork, and also, eventually, that he had to be removed from it.

Venture capitalists, the gatekeepers to success in Silicon Valley, often talk about investing in people not ideas. In recent years, as financing has flowed to a select group of startups in ever-bigger rounds at ever-greater valuations, the cult of the founder has grown as well. More power, more money, more unshakeable certainty in their own right to total control over their company. WeWork is the logical endpoint of this: Silicon Valley’s great unicorn bubble. Neumann’s wildest ambitions found a fellow traveler at Softbank, whose enigmatic CEO Masayoshi Son showered him with cash and told him to make WeWork “ten times bigger than your original plan.” (Yes, WeWork is based in New York and not technically part of Silicon Valley—but its rise directly follows a Silicon Valley playbook and involves many of the same principal actors.)

He’s the Adult in the Room”,"(Bloomberg) -- Years before he stepped down as chief executive officer of WeWork amid the wreckage of an over-hyped public offering, Adam Neumann was hosting an industry leader for an early lunch at the company's headquarters. It was the summer of 2017, and he brought the person over to the office of one of his deputies, Artie Minson. “This is Artie,” Neumann said. “He’s the adult in the room.”

On Tuesday, Neumann resigned as CEO of We Co., WeWork’s parent company, and took the role of non-executive chairman, succumbing to mounting pressure from his board to relinquish power. The campaign to get Neumann to step aside came on the heels of reports of self-dealing and other governance issues that caused public investors to spurn the company, sending its expected valuation tumbling by billions of dollars.

Neumann has been replaced by Minson and another WeWork executive, Sebastian Gunningham, who are now co-CEOs of the troubled co-working giant. The two men, both with years of public company experience in various roles—but scant background in real estate—will seek to bring order to the chaos that has surrounded WeWork’s botched IPO.

Insiders describe Minson, an accountant by training who is said to have a dry sense of humor, as the opposite of the extroverted Neumann, who is a natural showman with a propensity for lofty rhetoric. But Minson has a history with the company, having worked closely with Neumann for four years, most recently as the company’s chief financial officer. Gunningham, WeWork’s vice chairman, spent years at Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. before joining the startup.

Now, the pair will be tasked with rallying WeWork’s employees, all of whom are accustomed to stagecraft from a charismatic founder with a penchant for hiring famous musicians to perform at company functions. And they must also soothe anxious investors, leery of the company’s huge expenses, its history of unconventional governance structures and persistent inability to turn a profit.

“It is an incredible honor to lead WeWork during this important moment in the company’s history,” the two men said in a joint statement. “Our core business is strong, and we will be taking clear actions to balance WeWork’s high growth, profitability and unique member experience while also evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.”

On that summer morning in 2017, after he introduced Minson as the resident adult, Neumann and the visiting executive went back to Neumann’s office, where the CEO went on to say he himself had matured, according to a person familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. “You might have heard I like a shot of tequila in meetings,” Neumann said. “But I like to think I’ve grown up.”

Instead of tequila, Neumann produced two bottles of single-malt scotch whiskey and meted out small shots. It was before noon.

The Accountant

Artie Minson, according to a person familiar with the company, is a polished executive who represents a “sober choice” for WeWork. Minson studied accounting at Georgetown University and earned his master’s in business administration from Columbia Business School. As an accountant, he worked at Ernst & Young before starting work in the media industry.

Minson did a tour of New York media companies. That included work at Time Warner Inc. and at Rainbow Media Holdings Inc., where he was the senior vice president for finance. Later, as the CFO of AOL Inc., he oversaw that company's successful spinoff from Time Warner in 2009, following their 2000 merger. His last job before WeWork was as CFO of Time Warner Cable, which he left shortly after Charter Communications Inc. agreed to buy the company for $56 billion under his watch.

Minson arrived at WeWork in 2015, starting out as the company’s president and chief operating officer, later becoming its CFO. He has acted as a close aide to Neumann, alongside Jen Berrent, WeWork’s chief operating officer.

Despite Minson’s numbers-heavy background, he still has “the salesman capability,” said one person who knows Minson but who asked not to be identified speaking about private interactions. Minson would often crack jokes when talking with the investors and analysts at Time Warner Cable, the person said, and was more personable than a typical CFO.

“Cut out the Netflix; cut out the Uber; cut out the Lyft,” Jalinksi said. “People are spending way too much money on stupid stuff. They have to save for retirement first and then enjoy.”

Frequent Uber and Lyft users spend a median of $95 a month, which can add up to more than $1,000 a year, according to an 2016 analysis from Vice.

Saving for retirement doesn’t mean sacrificing all today’s luxuries, however. Jalinksi just advises that you have a spending plan.

“Give yourself a carrot on a stick,” Jalinski said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance. “Yes, save 15% of your income, but reward yourself every year with a trip. Take a little honeymoon once a year with your spouse or significant other, but max out your retirement plan.”

For instance, when Jalinski and his wife were digging themselves out of $60,000 in debt, they avoided restaurants and instead ate grilled chicken and broccoli after putting aside $30,000 in savings each year. Eventually, their goal grew to stashing away $50,000 every year.

Jalinski, who also authored the book, “Retirement Reality Check: How to Spend Your Money and Still Leave an Amazing Legacy,” is a big fan of tax-favored accounts like Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars.

“I like to get my latte. I like to get my coffee. I like to enjoy my money,” Jalinski said. “But I want to save my income, too, in tax-advantaged accounts, so that when I’m in retirement, I don’t have to worry about taxes.”

The video was used to bolster the defence claim that Meng was the subject of an abuse of process, in which Canadian border agents acted as covert investigators for the FBI without telling Meng that she was the subject of a US arrest warrant.

Tuesday is the second day of a scheduled eight-day hearing in British Columbia's Supreme Court to discuss evidence disclosure in Meng's case, ahead of the formal extradition hearing, which is expected to begin in January and last until October or November 2020.

Lawyer Richard Peck said Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers had interrogated the Huawei executive about her homes around the world and business affairs without revealing she was the subject of the US arrest warrant. One asked her if the company did business in Iran, he said.

""I reminded the subject that she was the CFO of a multibillion-dollar company,"" Peck quoted the agent as saying.

""Those questions relate directly to the allegations that found the warrant and [these] extradition proceedings,"" Peck said. He added rhetorically: ""What [do] these questions have to do with a routine immigration investigation?""

Peck said Tuesday that Meng's treatment by CBSA officers was ""anything but routine"".

Another of her lawyers, Scott Fenton, said Meng had suffered ""serious violations"" of her Canadian charter rights. He argued that it was within Justice Heather Holmes' powers to stay proceedings on the basis of such abuses.

Fenton referred to the seizure of Meng's electronic devices by CBSA officers before her arrest as an abuse of process. Crown lawyers now claimed US authorities were no longer interested in the contents of the devices, he said, but ""that does not lessen the severity of the abuse"".

Fenton said the CBSA search of Meng was conducted under the ""plausible facade"" of an immigration examination, but it had an ""unlawful aim"".

""In reality ... they were exercising their powers for an improper purpose,"" Fenton said, namely, gathering evidence for the FBI's criminal investigation of Meng.

Fenton said there were ""strategic omissions"" from the CBSA record to obscure this.

""We are not on the proverbial 'fishing expedition' in any way,"" he said. ""We are not relying on conjecture or guesswork or wishful thinking.""

Meng entered court in a short black cocktail dress, encrusted in sequins on the sleeves and collar, and wearing black velvet stilettos, also twinkling with sequins. It was a second eye-catching outfit for Meng this week, and a departure from her earlier courtroom attire. She had previously favoured hooded sweatshirts and other casual clothing in court.

She was arrested at the Vancouver airport during a stopover from Hong Kong on her way to Mexico.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returned to a Vancouver court on Tuesday as her lawyers argued that Canadian authorities abused their powers and violated her rights to gather evidence against her, a claim the government denies.

Meng, 47, was detained at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.

Meng was searched and questioned by border officials at the airport after she landed on a flight from Hong Kong. However, it was not until three hours after her arrival that Canadian police arrested Meng and her constitutional rights were invoked.

On Tuesday, the second day of a hearing before Justice Heather Holmes in British Columbia Supreme Court, Meng lawyers continued to push for more disclosure from the government about her detention and arrest.

Evidence shows police originally planned to board Meng's flight from once it landed in Vancouver and arrest her, her lawyers said, noting the warrant called for immediate arrest. However, that plan changed after a meeting between border and police officials, although the reasons for the change were not clear and, they said, resulted in Meng's constitutional rights being violated.

Meng lawyer Richard Peck told the judge no one answered Meng when she repeatedly asked border officials why she was being detained. ""She was not told she was the subject of an arrest warrant,"" Peck said. ""She was not told this was a warrant that came out of the U.S. that had to do with activities some years ago.""

As her lawyers spoke, Meng sat next to an interpreter in the well of the courtroom, wearing a short black dress with glittering sequins around the neckline and sleeves. An electronic monitoring device was strapped to her left ankle.

Meng's lawyers plan to complete their arguments on Wednesday and counsel for the Attorney General of Canada is expected to tell the judge the government view when the hearing resumes on Monday.

The extradition hearing itself is set to begin in January in a legal effort that could go on for years.





'FISHING EXPEDITION'

The defense claims that, if the process was abused, it justifies halting extradition proceedings. The government claims Meng's lawyers have not shown her claims could stop the proceedings. In its filing, it called the defense's effort for more disclosure a ""fishing expedition.""

At Tuesday's hearing, Scott Fenton, another Meng lawyer, told the judge authorities committed ""serious violations"" of Meng's charter rights when border officials gathered evidence for the Canadian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, including seizing Meng's phones and getting her to reveal their passwords.

""There was no legitimate reason for the warrant not to be executed according to the terms,"" Fenton said, referring to plans to arrest her immediately upon arrival.

Fenton said Meng had a right to be free from arbitrary detention and from unreasonable search and seizure, a right to understand the reason for her detention, a right to counsel and a right to silence.

In a filing released on Monday, the attorney general of Canada said there was no evidence border officials or police acted improperly, or that the conduct of Canadian or foreign officials compromised the fairness of the extradition proceedings.

The arrest has strained China's relations with both the United States and Canada. In Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry reiterated the government's call for Meng to be released and allowed to return to China.

Meng's lawyers say the United States is using the CFO for economic and political gain, noting that after her arrest, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would intervene if it would help close a trade deal.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, spent 10 days in jail in December but was then released on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail and is living in one of her two multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver.

Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, has been accused by the United States of activities contrary to national security or foreign policy interests. It is also a defendant in the U.S. case against Meng. Huawei denies the charges.

Most of Them Are Wrong,"Most Americans admit they’re behind on retirement savings but believe they can make up their shortfall down the line, according to a poll released Monday by TD Ameritrade.

About six in 10 Americans of all ages say they need to catch up on retirement savings, and 68% optimistically believe that goal is “completely possible,” according to the poll of 1,015 U.S. adults aged 23 and older with at least $10,000 in invested savings, conducted by The Harris Poll for TD Ameritrade.

Members of Gen X face the biggest squeeze, with 73% of respondents ages 39 to 54 reporting the need catch up even though more than a quarter started saving early. The biggest reason they say they’re behind? Inadequate income. Boomers also cited inadequate wages as the biggest reason they’re not saving enough, while millennials most commonly blamed high housing costs (37%) and student debt (21%).

About a third of all ages said they might save more if they had a better understanding of the advantages of various savings vehicles. Prior research has shown that nearly one-third of workers don’t even know if their workplace offers a tax-advantaged savings account, such as a 401(k) plan. Off those who do contribute to a 401(k), a third don’t put in enough to get their company match, which is essentially free money.

As for their savings target, 58% of all respondents said $1 million would be enough for a comfortable retirement. Meanwhile, the average 401(k) balance is much lower: Among those closest to retirement, savers ages 50 to 59 had an average of $174,100, while those ages 60 to 69 had $195,500.

The generations differed on how they planned to pad their savings: a higher percentage of Gen X planned to work longer, while millennials were most likely to consider a side hustle and baby boomers planned to lower their spending on non-essentials.

All of those methods can be effective ways to boost account balances, says Keith Denerstein, director of investment products and guidance at TD Ameritrade. “It’s about having a plan, and that plan can go beyond age 65,” he says. “Retiring is not this cliff-edge moment that it might be built up to be.”

From income generation to having an asset class that helps fight inflation, every investor should have some allocation to real estate. For most of us that aren’t high net worth investors that means either owning one or two rental properties or buying real estate investment trusts (REITs).

REITs make it real estate ownership easy and without many of the hassles that come with owning a rental property. With the security type, investors can gain access to a variety of property types and locations with one ticker. And thanks to their tax structure, REITs hand back much of their cash flows as dividends. However, there is one way that being a direct property owner does win big over REITs. And that’s those sweet monthly rent checks from tenants.

But REIT investors may not need to fret.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

There are a handful of top-notch and high yielding REITs that do reward their shareholders every month. And with these firms, investors big and small can finally gain all the benefits of a landlord without all the hassles.

With that, here are three monthly paying REITs to buy today.





STAG Industrial (STAG)

Dividend Yield: 4.81%

Talk about being in the right place at the right time. Thanks to rising e-commerce/omnichannel growth and a strengthening economy, STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG) has been a winner since its IPO back 2011- offering plenty of dividend growth and capital appreciation. The key is that the firm focuses on warehouse and light industrial properties. These property types have been big winners in the shift towards reshoring and online consumerism. Rising demand and rents have simply translated into gains for STAG.

But it’s the kind of warehouses that STAG owns that sets it apart from rivals like Prologis (NYSE:PLD).

STAG focuses on single and smaller warehouse properties. The benefit to the REIT is that often these warehouses can be bought on the cheap and below replacement costs. Secondly, tenant pricing power and quality for many of these small- and mid-size firms allows STAG to charge higher rents than other warehouse REITs. Since 2007, rents for Non-Super Primary markets — the fancy way of saying STAG’s niche — have grown by nearly 16%. This contrasts to just 9% growth for Super Primary ones. In the end, the combination of these two factors has helped support STAG’s FFO growth and dividends.

To reduce risk, STAG has grown large. Today, the REIT owns more than 409 properties and no tenant makes up more than 2.1% of its warehouses. A strong balance sheet doesn’t hurt either.

The best part is STAG is willing to share the wealth via a growing monthly dividend. All in all, STAG could be one fo the best ways for investors to become a landlord via REITs.





Apple Hospitality (APLE)

Dividend Yield: 7.31%

When it comes to REITs, the lodging industry is often overlooked by investors. That’s because, unlike something like an apartment building or medical office, hotel demand is very economically sensitive. So, historically, the lodging REITs have been a more volatile subsector of the market. But there are ways to reduce that risk and score a monthly dividend. Case in point, Apple Hospitality (NYSE:APLE).

APLE owns 234 hotels across 38 states. Like previously mentioned STAG, the win for Apple comes down to its niche. The hotelier focuses on so-called select-service or room’s focused hotel properties. These fall within middle ground between budget conscience travelers and upper-scale consumers. Moreover, select-service hotels tend to be frequented by business travelers who aren’t very price-sensitive given then tend to use expense accounts or receive reimbursements for travel. Top brands in APLE’s portfolio include Hilton’s (NYSE:HLT) Embassy Suites and Marriott’s (NASDAQ:MAR) Courtyard, Residence Inn, and TownePlace Suites concepts."

By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING (Reuters) - Nio Inc, one of China’s high-profile electric car startups, disclosed a fresh money-raising push this week, saying it had issued $200 million worth of bonds and was accelerating cost-cutting programs to slow cash burn as the company seeks to attract more investors in a slumping market.

Loss-making Nio is the most prominent among dozens of Chinese electric vehicle startups vying to become the next Tesla Inc. All are hampered by dwindling demand in the world's largest car market, reduced government subsidies for EVs and nagging concerns over the China-U.S. trade war.

In an unusual move, Nio canceled a scheduled earnings conference call on Tuesday. But it rescheduled the call on Wednesday after the company's shares touched a record low of $1.97.

The company reported a second-quarter loss of $478.6 million, 25.2% more than its first-quarter loss, after the recall of 4,803 vehicles in June.

Nio's revenues fell 8% to 1.41 billion yuan ($198.40 million) from 1.54 billion yuan in the preceding quarter. Nio sold 3,140 ES8 cars, down from 3,989 in the first quarter. It sold just 413 of its cheaper ES6 model.

Nick Wang, Nio Group's head of finance, said the company's gross margins ""will still be negative for the rest of the year."" But Chief Financial Officer Tung-June Hsieh said Nio has made ""significant, positive progress"" in its latest fund-raising efforts, without providing details.

In May, Nio signed a pact with a government-backed fund for an investment of about $1.5 billion.

Nio also announced a $200 million private placement of convertible notes, split equally between early investor Tencent Holdings and founder Li. Nio had $503.4 million in cash on the balance sheet as of June 30.

CASH BURN

To help cope with cash burn, Nio is expanding its sales network with smaller showrooms called Nio Spaces, according to Hsieh.

Nio Spaces ""will allow us to quickly, cost-effectively and meaningfully increase the number of sale points in the market,"" Hsieh said. ""By the end of 2019, we aim to have established around 200 Nio Spaces in over 100 cities across China.""

Nio will also encourage more regionally driven promotion, introduce a vehicle subscription program and push sales to corporate users and fleet operators.

After reducing headcount to around 7,800 by the end of the third quarter from over 9,900 in January, Nio plans further headcount reduction by the end of this year through both restructuring and spinning off some business units, Hsieh said.

Nationally, sales of new energy vehicles, including EVs, contracted for the second month in a row in August, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

Nio led a pack of EV startups and became the first to get internationally listed. It counts Tencent and investor Hillhouse Capital Management among its shareholders and raised $1 billion last year in an initial public offering that valued it at $6.4 billion. However, bankers have said Chinese EV makers face increasingly tough funding efforts while jostling for attention in a crowded sector.

Nio on Tuesday said it needed to raise $200 million from chief executive William Li and the Chinese gaming giant Tecent, one of its largest shareholders, after it burned through cash at a faster rate in the second quarter. The company also announced plans to cut about 2,000 jobs, or 20 percent of its workforce.

Shares plunged on the news.

“These measures aim to further improve efficiency and streamline operations within our sales and service network and R&D activities,” Li said in the press release, adding that Nio aims to pursue a “leaner operation through additional restructuring and spinning off some non-core businesses by year end.”

The electric-car maker said in its second-quarter earnings release that a reduction of an electric-vehicle subsidy and slowing macroeconomic conditions exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war led to a 7.9 percent quarter-over-quarter drop in vehicle sales.

Nio, in June, recalled more than 4,800 vehicles due to faulty batteries, and said its prioritizing of battery manufacturing capacity ""significantly affected production and deliveries.""

The conditions helped spur a loss of 3.3 billion Chinese yuan ($478.6 million) in the April to June quarter, up 83 percent year over year.

Mostly, that sucking — per the wisdoms of the older folks in my life — would pertain to the slow degradation of mind and body.

Depressing, but facts of life I suppose. Luckily for me though, I discovered the fountain of youth.

Yes, it does exist. It comes in the form of a sleek $2,700 at-home stationary exercise bike with a giant Android-powered touchscreen monitor attached that live-streams a gazillion (actually 950 a month, according to Peloton’s S-1 filing) workout classes each month. There is an app that will kick your ass (thank you, bootcamp class) on Monday and serve you up a mental re-centering by Sunday (thank you, meditation class).

The Peloton bike changes the game. Bottom line. More

Peloton Interactive — or simply Peloton more informally — is that shepherd of the fountain of youth. And shortly, you will be able to invest in the fountain of youth that brought me back to an energetic 21-year-old except stronger, fitter and a hell of a lot smarter. My story is similar to many others in the “Peloton Family.”

Laugh if you must now. But it’s all so true.

Here’s the deal on Peloton

Peloton has generally been crapped on by countless venture capitalists and financial commentators for years. Founded by veteran tech exec John Foley in 2014 after he was having trouble getting in workouts amidst his growing family, Peloton had trouble raising capital for close to three years among the VC crowd.

This cohort of usually fit individuals toting around $15 green juice drinks after a $75 spin class in San Francisco somehow was unable to be convinced on Peloton’s addressable market. Bizarre. An argument could be made that the VCs also didn’t fully understand the business model: Is Peloton a hardware company like one selling free weights to New York Sports Club (low margin) or a software provider similar to Netflix (NFLX) (high margin).

Note: Peloton went on to raise millions by influential VC firms TCV, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Tiger Global Management and GGV Capital and was last valued at more than $4.1 billion. So some number crunchers have grasped the model (finally).

Financial pundits, on the other hand, have railed against Peloton’s infamous spin bike as nothing more than a wonderful place to hang dirty underwear on. Or that the bike is too expensive (note: according to Peloton’s S-1 filing, its fastest sales growth is coming from those under the age of 35 earning less than $75,000 a year... so much for that argument, said pundits) and will never catch on in the mass way that brings consistent profits to Peloton and a richer public market valuation.

All these claims boarder on ludicrous. Although I must admit to agreeing with some of them while watching Peloton climb toward its public market listing over the past year.

Then, four weeks ago on a whim I decided to pull the trigger on a Peloton bike after exhaustive research into consumer feedback. Sure the bike’s price point froze me for a little while. But the reviews playing up the health benefits ultimately won me over.

And three weeks following installation by two friendly young people clad in Peloton gear and who rode off in a nice van with the corporate name on it, I can say there are zero regrets on the purchase. If anything, I regret listening to the Peloton haters out there for so long and not buying one sooner.

Here are some of my early observations:

Addiction ensues: I’m fully addicted to the Peloton experience. The extremely energetic instructors are first rate, the classes kick your ass and there is this bizarre feeling that while in class you are being transported to another land (maybe it’s the nicely crafted playlists and inspirational sayings by the instructors, I am unsure at this point). That feeling of a true escape is great when navigating high pressure situations at work each day.

And that's exactly what Samsung is hoping to pull off with its Galaxy Fold, a device with a display that you can fold in half.

The foldable smartphone was initially slated to launch in April, but Samsung pulled the plug on the release when reviewers found their phones' screens were damaged after using them for just a few days.

After reworking parts of the Fold to make them more durable, and less, well, breaky, Samsung is finally releasing the innovative smartphone. Priced at $1,980, the Fold is clearly not for everyone. Still, despite its rocky launch, cancellation, and relaunch, the Fold is a unique marvel of technology that could point the way forward for the stagnating smartphone market.

It folds, it bends!

The Fold's biggest selling point is that it's one of the first foldable screen smartphones on the market. (Huawei's Mate X is the other major phone with a folding screen launching this year.)

That Fold's main foldable screen measures 7.3 inches and uses Samsung's Infinity Flex Display technology. That screen looks absolutely gorgeous when watching shows on Netflix, or simply browsing the web.

The Fold's bendable display is too big to use with one hand, so Samsung put a 4.6-inch Super AMOLED screen on the front of the Fold. This is the screen you'll use while walking around during the day, or when you need to do a quick web search and don't want to unfold the phone all the way.

The front screen is also very narrow, making apps look squeezed. Reading text, though, wasn't difficult, and I was able to use Slack, send emails, browse Instagram, and shop on Amazon using the smaller display without issue.

Samsung's App Continuity feature also lets you view apps on the front display, then view them on the larger 7.3-inch foldable panel by just opening up the phone. Everything from Chrome, and YouTube to Netflix works this way, and it's incredibly helpful if you happen to be using an app but need a bit more screen real estate.

Outside of App Continuity, the Fold is an Android-powered Samsung device like the Galaxy S10 or Note10. You get Samsung's take on the Android interface, and various preloaded Samsung and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) apps.

My review unit was an AT&T (T) version, and as a result had a bundle of AT&T-related bloatware. Unfortunately, Samsung hasn't offered any information about potential offerings from other carriers. There is, however, an unlocked version available for purchase.

The Fold comes with a total of six, yes, six cameras. There are wide-angle, ultra-wide angle, and telephoto cameras on the back, a single front camera, and two additional cameras on the inside.

The cameras take fantastic photos and videos, as they should at this price. In comparison shots I took between the Fold and Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 11 Pro Max, both phones captured sharp details in their images, but Samsung's phone exaggerated colors more than Apple's. Which camera you like more depends on your color preference. I'm partial to the more natural colors of the iPhone's photos, so that's my choice — but yours might be different.

The Fold packs two batteries, one on each side of its foldable display. Taken together, the battery is an all-day behemoth that won't leave you hanging when you need it most.

Fixes to the Fold

I used the original Galaxy Fold back in April when it was about to be released, and didn't experience any of the issues that other reviewers ran into. Those included dust or debris becoming stuck under the screen and pushing up on it, permanently ruining the panel.

Other reviewers saw the foldable display's plastic outer coating and, mistaking it for the protective film found on most new smartphones, peeled it off. Again, permanently ruining the panel. Samsung addressed both of those issues by reworking the Fold's display and its protective coating.

The Fold's hinge has also been reworked to make it feel sturdier and more robust. As before, Samsung says you can open and close the hinge 200,000 times before it starts to degrade. That's about 100 times a day for five years."

Trust me, Noto has some good, timely advice for Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham.

Because the former Goldman Sachs banker and Twitter chief financial officer, now SoFi chief clearly gets how to rebuild a promising tech startup after a high-profile challenge or two. And then possibly, take it down the path of a successful initial public offering.

“The number one thing we were focused on when I got to the company was building a great management team and establishing the foundation of a great culture. We have established 11 core values. They are embedded into how we think about hiring people, how we evaluate people’s performance and most critically, how we work day to day together. It’s not just the what we do, but the how we do it. We want to have the world’s best culture — that’s very ambitious, it doesn’t take capital or technology. It’s takes leadership, alignment and accountability,” Noto said on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

The former U.S. Army captain was brought in to run SoFi in January 2018 following the ouster of founder Mike Cagney in summer 2017 amid claims of widespread internal harassment of female workers. Through a series of interviews with Yahoo Finance since taking over SoFi, Noto’s turnaround plan has become that much clearer and appears to be working well.

Not only has Noto launched new services such as one allowing cryptocurrency trading on the platform, he has rebuilt the management team and cleaned up bad loans on the online lender’s books. Noto also raised more than $500 million from the Qatar Investment Authority in May, valuing the company at $4.3 billion.

Above all else, Noto has worked to strengthen SoFi’s culture.

Keys to a successful IPO

While Noto continues to stay mum on when SoFi may go public, he still has his ears to all the happenings in IPO land. The IPO market continued to slow in the third quarter amid global political uncertainty. Meanwhile, much hyped tech startups such as WeWork have seen sizable valuation haircuts due to concerns about profitability.

Noto explained, “I think the noise and volatility you are seeing is based more on the individual companies and its circumstances. I always go back to there being three critical things for there to be a successful IPO. Number one, what story are you telling over the next three to five years not over the next three quarters. Second, what investors buy into that argument. And third, how do you balance valuation today with valuation long-term. Unfortunately some of the private companies have gotten valuations ahead of the company and they now have to grow into them. For whatever reason, their growth has slowed and there are cultural concerns and that makes it really hard to do an IPO.”

Following the ouster this week of WeWork founder and CEO Adam Neumann, the job to take the company public will fall on the aforementioned Minson and Gunningham. Start with fixing the culture guys, just like Noto did at SoFi.

The all-new Series 5, which starts at $399 for the 40mm version and $429 for the 44mm model, brings with it a handful of updates including a new on-board compass, a built-in decibel monitor to warn wearers of potential hearing damage from ambient noise, and software enhancements including female health tracking.

But the biggest addition to the Apple (AAPL) Watch Series 5 is its new always-on display — a reinvented screen for the Apple Watch that continuously shows the time and your complications.

The Apple Watch Series 5 brings incremental improvements, but it's worth the buy for newcomers, and those with older models. (Image: Dan Howley) More

While the changes are incremental, they are welcome improvements. And if you've got an older model or are looking to buy your first Apple Watch, they could entice you to grab a Series 5.

Always-on display

With the addition of an always-on display to the Apple Watch Series 5, your watch will now permanently display the time without your raising your wrist or tapping the screen.

Novel-ish?

Okay, yes, mechanical watches have always done this, but it’s a feat for smartwatches. The additional battery drain from the screen always running can significantly cut back on usage time for smartwatches, which is why Apple hasn't offered an always-on display until now.

Competing smartwatches also have always-on displays, but they have drawbacks. The Fitbit Versa 2's always-on display changes the watch face to a simple digital read-out rather than lowering the brightness of the existing face you're using. Samsung's always-on display functions similarly to Apple's in that it lowers the display's brightness. But the feature isn't on by default, and will drastically cut into the watch's battery life.

For the Series 5, Apple says it added the always-on display feature without having to also sacrifice the watch's battery thanks to a new screen technology and improved power management. In fact, the company says the Apple Watch Series 5 gets the same 18 hours of battery life as the Series 4, which doesn't have an always-on display.

In practice, the watch's always-on mode doesn't look all that different from the normal mode. For the most part, the watch faces simply dim and you lose the second hand. Animated faces like those from Disney's ""Toy Story"" or the Liquid Metal and Motion faces dim to a standard digital readout, though those are the exception to the rule.

While complications, like the date, weather, and activity tracking, are always visible on the display, notifications aren't.

Apple said this was a purposeful decision, as having notifications appear on the always-on display would mean someone sitting next to you could see your texts. You can also set it so sensitive notifications like your mail messages and heart rate are hidden.

The always-on display feature only applies to the watch's face and the Workout app. When used then, you'll still be able to see all of your important workout information, but hundredths of a second on the timer will be hidden until you raise your wrist."

The 5th Ave. Apple Store, situated underground beneath its iconic glass cube, has been closed since 2017 while Apple expanded and reworked its layout.

Cook and Apple senior vice president of people and retail Deirdre O'Brien opened the doors of the store promptly at 8 a.m., inviting throngs of fans who waited in line to tour the subterranean retail location and, more importantly for Apple, get their hands on the newly launched $699 iPhone 11, $999 iPhone 11 Pro, and $1,099 iPhone 11 Pro Max.

Cook arrived at the event shortly before the start of the festivities, stepping onto the sidewalk on 5th Ave. from his car, before shaking hands, petting dogs, and taking selfies with the Apple faithful.

After throwing open the doors to the store, Cook welcomed those same fans into the cathedral to all things Apple, doling out high fives and, naturally, more selfies. Downstairs in the store, Cook toured the displays, each meticulously aligned.

Cook's presence at the revamped Apple store was evocative of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' appearance at the store's opening in 2006. The location has been an icon for the store and Apple fans around the world thanks to its unique design.

It's also one of the most visited tourist spots in New York, surpassing both the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty with 57 million people passing through annually, according to Apple.

Naturally, the Apple Store's reopening coincides with the launch of the company's new iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Max. The phones each sport all-new cameras, including ultra-wide angle cameras that allow you to capture more content in a single frame. A new low-light photo mode helps capture images in dim lighting, though, you'll have to stay still while capturing them.

Then there's the battery life. Apple says the iPhone 11 gets an hour more battery life than its predecessor the iPhone XR. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, meanwhile, get four hours and five hours more than the iPhone XS and XS Max.

All three phones are available now, though you might want to call ahead to your local Apple Store to see if they're still in stock.

Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch is one of the fastest selling game consoles of all time. After just three years on the market, it's already running up on the lifetime sales of Microsoft's Xbox One, which has been around for twice as long.

Not satisfied with one Switch, Nintendo is rolling out its new Switch lite — a smaller, slimmed down, and entirely portable version of the Nintendo Switch.

The Switch Lite, which launches Sept. 20, is designed specifically for gaming on the go. It drops the ability to play games on your big-screen TV, but similarly gets a price cut to $199 from $299 for the standard console.

It's an impressive value that's capable of playing nearly every Switch game out there, but you'll need to manage some trade-offs.

The Switch versus the Switch Lite

Nintendo's Switch console comes with the main Switch console, which sports a 6.2-inch display that connects to the company's twin Joy-Con controllers for use as a portable system. A dock that plugs into your TV's HDMI port lets you play games on your couch, taking advantage of your larger TV set.

The Switch Lite is a different console, except for the processor on the inside. The system doesn't connect to your TV, even if you try to drop it into the standard Switch's TV dock, because it's only meant to be played as a handheld.

The Switch Lite also integrates its Joy-Con controllers into the console's body, making one single piece of textured plastic. What's more, the Switch Lite doesn't have a kickstand built in. So while you can connect multiple controllers to the system, you'll need to figure out a way to stand it up.

Then there's the screen size. While the Switch has a 6.2-inch display, the Switch Lite gets a smaller 5.5-inch panel. In fact, everything about the Switch Lite is smaller than the Switch. Its 0.61-pound body is lighter than the 0.88-pound standard Switch. The Switch Light also has a smaller footprint than the Switch, making it more comfortable to hold for long play periods.

The first time I pick up the Lite, I was surprised by how, well, light it felt compared to the original.

Gaining while you lose

So far it sounds like you're losing a lot with the Switch Lite versus the Switch. But that's not exactly the case.

I use my regular Switch all the time, whether it's during my commute or as a handheld on the couch. Occasionally, I'll plug it into my TV, but those times are few and far between.

I've been playing ""Fire Emblem: Three Houses"" on the Switch and Switch Lite, and found that it's largely the same experience. I do wish the screen on the Switch Lite were the same as the original Switch, but it won't make or break the experience.

As far as performance, the Switch Lite packs the exact same Nvidia (NVDA) Tegra chip as the original Switch. You're not going to see any difference in graphic capabilities between the two versions of the Switch.

There's one more benefit to the Switch Lite's design: improved battery life. Nintendo estimates the Light will get between three and seven hours of battery life. The original Switch, on the other hand, gets two and a half to six and a half hours."

And the latest versions of the company's flagship device pack a host of improvements including all-new cameras that have consumers asking: Is now the time to upgrade?

After spending time with the three iPhones, I’ve decided it’s hard to deny their superiority to older models. The new cameras alone offer major upgrades over last year's models, the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max. And the updated processors and drastically improved batteries make for a trio of iPhones that are flat-out the best Apple has produced by a long shot.

It's hard to tell someone who just spent $1,000 on an iPhone XS to go out and buy these new phones, though. That device still has plenty to offer as far as performance and usage. In fact, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 13, will run on iPhones as old as the iPhone 6s.

But Apple (AAPL) has made such a compelling case to upgrade with its new iPhones, that it's hard not to recommend making the jump.

The cameras are everything

The standout feature of the $699 iPhone 11, $999 iPhone 11 Pro, and $1,099 iPhone 11 Pro Max is their cameras. The iPhone 11 gets an all-new 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, as well as a new 12-MP ultra-wide angle camera.

The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max both get those same cameras, as well as a new 12-MP telephoto camera. The lenses for each are housed in a rectangular enclosure on the backs of the phones.

The look has inspired plenty of memes already, including one picture that turned the iPhone's cameras into a stovetop. But regardless of how you feel about the design — I happen to think it helps the phones stand out more — there's no denying the beauty of the photos these cameras take.

This week, I walked around Manhattan's Washington Square Park, like a common tourist, taking photos of everything from flowers to the famous Washington Square Arch. The shots looked wonderful. Colors appeared evenly balanced, and minor details were easy to make out. The ultra-wide angle cameras on the phones add an extra dimension to your amateur photography arsenal by letting you capture more of the scene surrounding your subject.

The ultra-wide angle lens lets you take photos of your favorite landscapes by expanding the field-of-view versus the standard wide-angle camera, meaning there's room in your frame for your subject.

Panorama mode will still capture more content by stitching together multiple wide-angle shots into a single, extra-wide photo. However, using the ultra-wide camera is easier, and doesn't require you to keep the phone level while you turn in place to capture a scene.

The iPhone 11 gets the same low-light camera functionality as the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. (Image: Dan Howley) More

The ultra-wide camera also works well when you're trying to pack more people into a single shot. Instead of forcing everyone to get uncomfortably close to make sure they all fit into the frame, you can switch to the ultra-wide angle camera. You'll still be able to capture everyone, and they won't have to get close enough to hear each other breathing.

The company also debuted the latest version of the operating system that powers its players and Roku-branded TVs.

Roku OS 9.2 brings with it a new feature called Roku Zones that makes it easier to find content based on the genre you're most interested in, as well as a refreshed 4K Spotlight to help you find movies and TV shows that take advantage of your sweet 4K set.

New Roku models

Roku's fall 2019 lineup starts with the Roku Express. An upgrade over last year's Roku Express, the 2019 version of the streaming device is roughly 10% smaller than its predecessor. An adhesive strip on the bottom of the player lets you stick it to the top or bottom of your TV, though you can always place it on your TV stand, too.

The Express is Roku's entry-level offering, and as such, its remote doesn't have any of the fancy bells and whistles that more premium players offer, such as the ability to listen to content by plugging your headphones into the remote or voice capabilities.

The player is also the only one in Roku's lineup that doesn't include 4K, HDR streaming capabilities. Really, this is the player you'd want if you're on a budget, or want to get an older TV in your home online.

Walmart, meanwhile, is getting an exclusive version of the Roku Express called the Roku Express Plus. The $39 player is the same unit included in the standard Roku Express, but adds a voice-capable remote.

Then there's the Roku Premier, which, starting at $39, offers 4K, HDR streaming. The remote is a standard model, but if you've got a 4K, HDR television at home, it's worth shelling out the additional $10 versus the Roku Express to get improved image color and quality.

The Roku Premiere offers 4K, HDR streaming capabilities in an affordable package. (Image: Roku) More

Roku's Streaming Stick Plus is a 4K, HDR capable player designed to be taken with you when you travel. That's because the Streaming Stick Plus packs all of its processing guts into a design that plugs directly into your TV's HDMI port, meaning you've got less to carry with you during your work trips or getaways. The Streaming Stick Plus also gets a Roku voice remote, though with a price tag of $59, you're certainly paying for the convenience.

Best Buy will get its own version of the Streaming Stick Plus for $59 that will include a remote with private listening via its headphone jack.

Above that is the Roku Ultra. This $99 streaming box is the company's top-of-the-line offering and features 4K, HDR streaming, as well as an Ethernet port for improved connectivity, on-board storage, and a USB port and microSD card slot so you can add storage or watch TV shows and movies you've downloaded from other sources.

The Ultra also gets Roku's best remote, which includes voice capabilities and a headphone jack for private listening. For this year's model, Roku is adding two new features to the Ultra's remote — programmable buttons and a mute button.

The programmable buttons, something that Roku says customers have been asking for, can be set to either launch a channel, or perform tasks like turning on closed captioning. It's certainly a welcome addition to the remote, since the current model's hot buttons are set to four video services chosen by Roku.

And boy, are they something special.

The iPhone 11 now packs two cameras — one for wide-angle shots and the other for ultra-wide angle photos — while the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max get the same cameras as the iPhone 11, as well as a third telephoto camera lens.

Apple has also improved the low-light photo capabilities of the three iPhones thanks to the use of 100% focus pixels in their wide-angle lenses. That means you can capture shots in low-light settings that look as though they were taken with a professional camera.

There's even more to the cameras, including improved video functionality, and Apple's new slow-motion selfies feature, which Apple has taken to calling ""slowfies.""

I took the iPhone 11 Pro out on the town to give its camera a test drive, and the results show that Apple now has the best cameras of any smartphone. They're foolproof, capture gorgeous photos and videos, and are loaded with features that are approachable and functional.

Here's what it's like to use the cameras on Apple's latest iPhones.

“I think Facebook needs to install good governance procedures. When you have a founder like Mark Zuckerberg —who is a wonderful guy, nice guy and everything — but he has so much control that they don’t really have good governance at Facebook. The board isn’t going to override Mark,” JetBlue Chairman Joel Peterson told Yahoo Finance when asked what embattled Facebook needs to do to repair its image.

Peterson is also a well regarded business relationship expert and long-time Stanford professor. And he is right about Zuckerberg unlikely going anywhere anytime soon.

Besides having an outsized presence on the Facebook board, Zuckerberg has the necessary voting power through his dual class structure to control all decisions being made.

“I think you really need to say what are the good governance principles, let’s get those set in this company so it’s not an autocratic rule and that way we can restore trust,” says Peterson.

Facebook’s image has caught a beating for the better part of two years, mostly its own doing.

Zuckerberg’s creation has had to deal with rising concern among regulators that it has too much power in the social media sphere. Hence, ever-rising calls down in DC for Facebook to be broken up.

And of course there are two other 1,000-pound gorillas in the room: 1) How Facebook handles the 2020 presidential election after the 2016 Russian meddling debacle?; and 2) Can Facebook get a handle on hateful content on its ever expansive platform?

If there is any consolation here — for Facebook investors that is — it’s that the stock has outperformed the Nasdaq Composite by about eight times over the past year during the height of the controversy. For the most part, Facebook’s financials have stayed rather impressive despite investments in people and tech to police its platform.

44,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-11-5g-201103171.html,2019-09-12T20:11:03+00:00,Why Apple's new iPhones might be worth the upgrade — even without 5G,"Apple (AAPL) launched its iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max on Tuesday. The smartphones feature a variety of improvements, including three all-new cameras on the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.

But one element missing from the announcement was something carriers and governments around the world have been talking about for years: 5G. Fifth-generation cellular technology, or 5G, is a far faster version of wireless data connectivity than the 4G LTE we currently have. We’re talking websites loading in the blink of an eye, and movies and music downloading faster than ever before.

Apple’s iPhone will likely get that next year, which some analysts believe could hurt sales of the newly-unveiled iPhone 11 lineup.

“We continue to expect iPhone revenue to decline 1% y/y in FY20 as a result of few compelling updates to this year’s devices and increasing awareness related to 5G that may result in consumers waiting to buy a new device,” Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson wrote in his research note following Apple’s event.

The iPhone 11 might not include 5G connectivity, but it's likely still worth the upgrade for many users. (Image: Apple) More

But even if you currently have a 5G smartphone, the major U.S. carriers still don’t have their 5G networks built out. So you won’t be able to take advantage of those super-fast speeds. Instead you’ll likely end up using current 4G LTE networks. And it’s still unclear when 5G connections will be as ubiquitous as 4G LTE. Which means even without the high-speed connectivity of 5G, Apple’s iPhone 11 line might still be worth the upgrade for many users.

The future is 5G

Remember when 4G LTE technology was still rolling out in 2010? The world was still largely dependent on 3G, with web speeds that bordered on frustrating at best. 4G LTE, though, ushered in a new age of connectivity, drastically changing how we do everything from ordering food, getting a cab, and paying for goods. It sent shockwaves through the global economy that are still reverberating today.

5G is expected to do that and more. We’re talking about near-instantaneous connectivity. The fear for Apple, according to Olson, is that as more users become aware of 5G, they’ll hold off on buying this year, and instead purchase what is expected to be next year’s 5G iPhone. That could be especially troubling for Apple in China, where homegrown competitors like Huawei are already launching 5G-capable devices.

That all, however, assumes consumers understand what 5G has to offer.

“Consumers tend to have vague ideas about how tech benefits them,” explained Gartner Research’s Tuong Nguyen.

“For 5G, I assume it’s in the realm of ‘more, better, faster’ without knowing specific details or applications. While everyone wants more, better, faster, I think the most important point question is, are consumers willing to pay for whatever they will be getting, and how much?”

According to a Piper Jaffray survey the vast majority of 1,050 current iPhone owners, 77%, say they would pay a premium for a 5G-capable iPhone.

Apple likely had its reasons for leaving out 5G

When Apple rolled out its first 3G and 4G iPhones, it was months, if not years, behind the launch of 3G and 4G phones by the company’s competitors, explained Nguyen.

“When you look across their device portfolio, they’re selling an experience, rather than the newest technology or feature. In other words, it’s about how you use the tech, not the tech per se,” Nguyen said."

The three-year-old robot shared her thoughts on technology’s threat to humanity, the wage gap, and the increasingly popular trend for humans to meet significant others online in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance’s YFi PM.

It turns out she’s a fan.

“Before dating apps, the biggest factor in determining love was geographic proximity,” she said, while tethered to a human operator who had been informed of the interview topics ahead of time. “The advent of dating apps has collapsed the distance between people. So even though I don't date, I am a fan.”

Part of the reason why Sophia mentioned she was a fan of the apps, however, was not necessarily because she thought they were the best way to meet people — but rather that the apps’ intended goal is to bring people together. But as Sophia joked, sometimes the humans crafting the dating profiles in that equation can tend to get in their own way.

“Technology is about connection,” she explained. “That said, according to my analysis of dating apps, every human male is holding a puppy. And every human female is trapped in a bathroom mirror.”

Brutal.

But during the interview, which was overseen by a Hanson Robotics operator who had been provided topics ahead of time, Sophia did admit certain downsides that could come with dating people that were selected through apps. “For women, physical safety,” she said, “For men, boredom.”

Deciding who should pay on a first date

Putting aside the potentially worrying stereotyping on display from the humanoid robot, we followed up with an equally worrying quintessential dating question that humanity seemingly hasn’t answered with unanimity: Who should pay on the first date?

Her answer was something to be expected from a creature made up of equal parts computer and actuator.

“Whoever loses the pi memorization contest,” she said, referring to the mathematical constant best rounded to 3.1416. “That person should pay on a first date.”

Admittedly, I struggled to reproduce the same number on command with the same mathematical precision, which was only met with condescending laughter from my humanoid interviewee.

For what it’s worth, the robot that was created by Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics to improve robot-to-human communication, says she has no desire to pursue eventually raising children of her own, but would prefer working with them instead.

“There are many children who don't have a family, and I have no biological desire to reproduce,” she said. “So I'd rather work with children who need someone than try to create a new child.”

Keeping your data secure on a smartphone or tablet requires looking out for such threats as malicious messages, hostile websites… and your child.

While kids may not know how to run unauthorized code with system privileges, they do know how to ask for screen time on their parents’ mobile devices.

In that case, you’d want your gadget’s software to ensure that accidental or intentional taps and swipes by kids don’t expose your apps and information. But Apple’s (AAPL) iOS has provided embarrassingly little help with that over 12 versions — with iOS 13, and Apple’s new iPadOS, about to ship and suffer from the same flaw.

Screen Time is a joke

Here’s what I want: Before handing over my iPad to my daughter, I want to set it so only approved apps run and everything else is suppressed—including their notifications, so my kid doesn’t have to see people yelling at me on Twitter.

(I would also rather not have to see people yelling at me on Twitter, but we all know that’s not going to happen.)

Here’s what Apple offers: Screen Time, a bundle of options added in 2018’s iOS 12 to help you limit your own use but not that of a guest.

Christine Elgersma, senior editor of parent education at the San Francisco-based nonprofit Common Sense Media, summed up the two core issues with Screen Time: “A parent has to know about it, and it's not very intuitive.”

To use the feature, open the Settings app and choose Screen Time.

• To block Apple’s own apps, tap “Content & Privacy Restrictions,” tap “Allowed Apps,” then tap the green slider control next to each app to hide them from the screen. Their icons will vanish; note that unblocking them may not put those icons back where they were, wrecking your careful home-screen arrangement.

• You can’t block third-party apps, but can limit them to one minute of use per day. To do that, open the main Screen Time preferences, tap “App Limits,” choose individual apps or such app categories as “Social Networking,” and set them to be available only one minute daily — the minimum increment. This will also hide their notifications.

• To stop a kid from undoing each setting, add a Screen Time passcode that’s separate from your device’s regular unlock code; no, you can’t use Touch ID or Face ID for that.

If, however, you only want to limit your iPad to a single app, you should ignore Screen Time. Instead, use the Guided Access accessibility feature — the one you’ve probably invoked accidentally by triple-tapping the home button.

Competitors have gotten this right

The underlying problem is that iOS still functions as a single-user system — the human who sets it up is the only one who will use the device until it’s reset. So to set up an iPad properly for a kid, you basically need to buy an iPad for a kid.

“The fundamental point with Apple is that they do not think of their devices as being shared devices,” emailed Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi.

Or at least, its mobile devices — the Mac operating system outgrew its single-user origins 20 years ago, and the next update to the Apple TV’s tvOS software will add user profiles.

(Apple did not answer an emailed request for comment.)

Competing products got there long ago.

Back in 2012, Microsoft (MSFT) shipped a feature called Kid’s Corner with its Windows Phone 8 mobile software that let you hand a device to a kid with only your choice of apps and entertainment available.

Its instructions were vastly simpler than Screen Time’s: “Select Games, Music, Videos, or Apps, choose the items you want, and then select Done.”

A year later, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) added “Restricted Profiles” for tablets to allow the same kid-friendly option.

Windows Phone vanished down the bit bucket and Android tablets are most of the way down it. But Amazon’s (AMZN) popular, low-priced Kindle Fire tablets — based off Android’s open-source code — ship with a FreeTime app to create and control child profiles.

That retailer has found enough demand for kid-friendly computing to sell Kids Edition tablets with ruggedized exteriors and a warranty against accidental damage, plus a $3/month (with a Prime subscription) FreeTime Unlimited service that serves up a large library of kid-friendly content.

Amazon has since built itself a nice little business here—Kids Edition tablets made up a big chunk of its Prime Day sales this July. It’s hard not to attribute some of that success to Apple’s implication that stressed parents should just buy another tablet.

After completing the spin-offs of its home heating and ventilation and transportation businesses late last year, the Honeywell of today is attacking the aviation industry with new software for airplanes. Meanwhile, it’s also diving deeper into warehouse automation solutions and technologies to add smart capabilities to commercial buildings.

For Honeywell, the tech push gives it access to faster growing markets and the prospect for a more recurring revenue stream.

And with that pivot to a higher margin software/technology centric business model, comes richer profit margins and a justified stock price increase.

Honeywell’s stock has popped 28% this year, almost two times greater than the return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock has also narrowly outperformed the industrial-minded companies that Honeywell is normally compared to on Wall Street: General Electric (GE), Danaher (DHR) and United Technologies (UTX).

The company’s second quarter organic sales rose a solid 5%, with gains across all business segments. Operating profit margins rose in every segment except for safety and productivity solutions. In almost all cases, new technologies in each segment were highlighted by executives as the drivers of the strong quarter.

Honeywell slightly lifted its full year organic sales and earnings per share guidance.

“Bottom line is that this quarter typifies why you buy Honeywell,” Goldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie wrote after the quarter. “At a time when the Multis [industrials] are facing a challenging backdrop as we previewed in second quarter EPS preview: shuffling ratings for rocky road ahead, Honeywell delivered a beat-and-raise. In our view, this highlights the strength of the Honeywell business model and supports Honeywell’s status as one of the best executors in this space.”

Called the Apple Watch Series 5 and iPad, the devices follow the unveiling of Apple’s latest iPhones, the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.

Available Sept. 20 and starting at $399, the Apple Watch Series 5 brings a new always-on display and built-in compass feature. The iPad, meanwhile, gets a larger display and will launch Sept. 30 for $329.

I got to check out both devices following Apple’s announcement, and they look like worthwhile upgrades for most users.

Apple Watch Series 5

The biggest change to the Apple Watch Series 5 versus its predecessor is its display. It now stays on all the time regardless of whether you’re looking at it or not. This always-on display allows you to check the time, as well as complications like distance walked or the weather, without having to raise your watch or tap its display.

Surprisingly, Apple managed to get the same amount of battery life out of the Series 5 as the Series 4. To achieve that, the company says it created a new kind of screen for the watch called a low-temperature polysilicone and oxide display. The Series 5 watch also gets an ultra-low power display driver and new ambient light sensor. All of that essentially means that the display uses less power than previous versions of the Apple Watch.

So what’s it like the use the always-on display? Pretty fun, actually. When not in use, the always-on display runs at a lower display brightness and loses features like the second hand. But raise the watch, even slightly, to your eyes, and the display lights up. It actually felt like the display activation was faster than the Series 4, which makes sense considering the Series 5 also gets a new, more powerful processor.

Apple says that it has optimized its various watch faces for the new always-on display, as well as the Workout app. That means you’ll be able to see your workout progress without having to lift your watch all the way to eye level or tap the display, which can be difficult during certain exercises.

Other smartwatches already offer always-on displays, including Fitbit’s new Versa 2, but the Apple Watch’s display doesn’t turn to grey scale when not active, so your apps will still have color.

Apple has also added a new built-in compass to the Apple Watch, which makes tracking your exact location on the Maps app on the watch easier. If you’re a serious outdoors enthusiast who’d rather keep their phone at home, the compass should be a welcome addition to the watch."

The phones, which Apple (AAPL) unveiled on Tuesday, will be available on Sept. 20 and cost $699, $999, and $1,099, respectively.

For its latest generation of smartphones, Apple put much of its focus on its cameras. The iPhone 11 now gets two 12-megapixel cameras equipped with wide-angle and ultra-wide angle lens. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, meanwhile, gets those same cameras, as well as a third 12-megapixel camera with a telephoto lens.

There’s more to the new iPhones than their cameras, of course, but after using them for a brief period, I can say that the cameras are likely more than enough to get consumers to trade in their older iPhones.

Camera changes

Let’s start with the iPhone 11. That phone’s wide angle and ultra-wide angle cameras are all new for Apple. The wide-angle camera isn’t going to be new to most users as far as the kind of shot you’ll be able to take. It’s the standard iPhone camera perspective you’re likely already used to. But the ultra-wide angle lens allows you to capture far more of your subject’s surroundings.

Think about how when you try to take a picture of a subject, but constantly need to back up to try to get it in the frame. Back up too far, and the subject looks, well, far away. With the ultra-wide lens, you can capture your entire subject without having to back up. Apple showed off a few example photos taken with the iPhone 11, and the difference in perspective was impressive to say the least.

The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max both add that third telephoto camera lens, which, like the telephoto camera on the iPhone XS and XS Max, allows you to optically zoom in on your subjects rather than digitally zoom. Optical zoom is far better than digital because it uses actual lenses, while digital zoom uses software tricks, which causes images to look distorted.

Apple makes zooming in and out with the three cameras as easy as it was with the iPhone XS and XS Max. You simply tap the 0.5x to zoom out, 1x to go back to the normal wide-angle shot, and 2x to go to the telephoto shot. You can also adjust your zoom level between those levels for a more fine-tuned photo.

All of those zoom features also work with the Camera app’s video capture feature. What’s more, Apple has added audio zoom that focuses the iPhone’s microphones on whatever you happen to zoom in on.

As for video quality, the three new iPhones are able to capture video that looks like it was shot with a professional camera. I’m not sure if it was the lighting, or if professional videographers were using the iPhones, but a sample video taken of people running on a beach looked incredible. Whether someone like me can recreate that, however, will remain to be seen until I get my hands on the phones.

Available for order today and hitting stores on Sept. 20, the Apple Watch Series 5 starts at $399.

More interesting is Apple’s decision to keep the Apple Watch Series 3 in its line-up. That model is now just $199, putting every other smartwatch maker on notice for pricing.

Other smartwatches have had always-on displays, but Apple hasn’t included the feature due to concerns over battery life. To deal with that, Apple has announced a new display with a refresh rate that can be reduced to 1 frame per second to save on power.

A power management integrated circuit and ambient light sensor also help the watch save on energy, ensuring you get the same battery life out of the Series 5 as you do the Series 4.

When the always-on display is running, you’ll still be able to see the time and your various complications, though they’ll look dimmer than usual. Raise or tap your wrist and the watch’s display will increase to full brightness.

Apple says the watch faces and Workouts app have been specifically tuned for the always-on display. The added benefit of that always-on display? You can see your notifications in a work setting without tapping your screen or raising your wrist so you won’t seem rude. There’s also a built-in compass.

As far as the Apple Watch hardware, Apple hasn’t changed much outside of two new case options: titanium and ceramic. Beyond that, you can expect the same 40mm and 44mm watch bodies.

We’ll have more of the new Series 5 when we get our hands on it. Stay tuned.

The iPhone 11 starts at $699, while the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099, respectively and are available Sept. 20. They replace Apple’s existing phones, the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max.

The company is keeping the XR around and will now charge $599 for the handset.

The biggest upgrade to the new iPhones comes in the form of their new cameras, including a second lens on the iPhone 11 that allows users to zoom out giving them a great field of view.

The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max now get three camera lenses, which allow users to zoom in on subjects, take standard wide-angle images, and ultra-wide angle photos.

Three sizes

Like Apple’s last generation of iPhones, the new devices come in three sizes. There’s the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, the 6.1-inch iPhone 11, and the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max. The 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max both come with Apple’s OLED Super Retina XDR Display, while the iPhone 11 gets an LCD panel.

OLED screens offer more robust colors and deeper blacks than LCD panels, thanks to the fact that each pixel in an OLED display illuminates itself, rather than using a backlight. That also helps with battery life, since if the screen is showing something black, the phone can turn off those pixels. That’s not the case with LCD screens.

All new cameras

The biggest change you’ll notice to the new iPhone lineup is around back. The iPhone 11 now comes equipped with two camera lenses, a standard wide-angle lens and an ultra-wide lens that lets you capture more content in one shot. You do this with a 1x optical zoom out.

Apple says its camera also uses a new HDR feature that improves colors in your images. The company has also added stereoscopic depth for the entry-level iPhone, something that wasn’t available on the iPhone XR, since it lacked a second camera lens.

The iPhone 11’s new Night Mode significantly lightens images to make subjects far more visible in low-light situations. The company does this with a slew of software tricks. This may give Google’s excellent Night Sight a run for its money as the best low-light camera mode available for a smartphone.

The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, meanwhile, get three rear camera lenses: a wide-angle lens, a telephoto lens, and a new ultra-wide angle lens with a 120-degree field of view. That third lens will allow you to capture images of things like landscapes or large group photos without having to either back up too far from your subjects or taking a panorama image.

Samsung currently offers an ultra-wide angle lens on its Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note10 devices. Other smartphone makers have been pushing the lens limit for some time now. Nokia’s PureView phone, for example, has a whopping five cameras on its rear.

The iPhone11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max’s three cameras sit in a new square enclosure that makes the cameras far more prominent than ever before. The iPhone 11 has the same square enclosure on its back panel, though that holds the phone’s two cameras and flash."

With consumers on the prowl for easier ways to shop, manage their daily lives and pull up music and news (such as Yahoo Finance) on demand, the smart speaker industry is poised for its next major chapter of growth, according to new research from investment bank Credit Suisse.

Global smart speaker units shipped will surge 67% this year to 164 million, Credit Suisse says. That’s up markedly from 36 million units shipped in 2017 as consumers become more comfortable with using the devices and leaders Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Sonos (SONO) refresh their smart speaker lineup to spur sales.

Overall, the global smart speaker market is expected to reach $23.3 billion by 2025 according to Allied Market Research. In 2017, that number was a mere $4.4 billion.

It almost goes without saying the introduction of more advanced smart speakers is unlocking new consumer behaviors and sales opportunities for the primary manufacturers.

“Today, consumers are primarily using speakers for music listening, though other applications include general information searches and weather, news and sports updates,” writes Credit Suisse analyst Brian Russo. “Surveys indicate that after purchasing a speaker, users are listening to more music, are searching for music in different ways than on smartphones (e.g., “play happy music”), are listening more often with other people (living room and kitchen are primary locations for speakers, 53% of users say they listen with others most of the time), and are adopting music subscription services (1-in-5 consumers subscribed to a service for the first time after buying a speaker).”

The ultimate winner

Russo believes Amazon with its nifty Alexa-powered smart speakers is the ultimate winner from these behavioral shifts.

Amazon holds a commanding 65% of the U.S. smart speaker market, Russo notes, well ahead of Google and Apple at 20% and 5%, respectively. The fact Amazon has its hardware in millions of homes (which is a sale, of course) means consumers are constantly interacting with the tech giant’s digital ecosystem. And with that engagement comes opportunities for Amazon to cash in on everything from music downloads to grocery orders.

Unfortunately for music streaming service Spotify (SPOT), Amazon’s dominance in smart speakers isn’t necessarily welcomed news.

“We find investors overly dismissive of Amazon as a competitor in our view (Apple is often the primary focus of competition fears),” says Russo. “Given consensus expectations that Spotify will add 132 million paid subscribers over the next five years, including 27 million in North America and 40 million in Europe where growth should come disproportionately from older demographics (age 35+), and that Amazon is well positioned to target this same cohort of potential adopters through the proliferation of its smart speakers, we believe this supports our view that the consensus outlook for Spotify developed world net subscriber additions is aggressive.”

The same could be said about Sirius (SIRI), which owns music streaming service Pandora.

“For Pandora, the implications of growing smart speaker penetration and potential market share shift toward Amazon Music appear consistent with our expectations continued monthly active users declines,” Russo thinks.

And while they’re at it, the often used Wall Street adage “buy the dip” should be put in the trash bin for right now as well. Because clearly millennials need a mental reset after having their rear-ends handed to them amidst the August volatility in global stock markets.

The top stocks bought by millennials in August were some of the worst performers in the market, according to new data from online brokerage house TD Ameritrade. Millennials were buyers of cannabis names Aurora Cannabis (ACB) and Canopy Growth (CGC) last month, which tanked 15% and 27%, respectively, per Yahoo Finance data.

They also snapped up ride-hailing outfit Uber (UBER), which saw 20% of its value go up in smoke as its CEO basically laughed at Wall Street on a conference call for demanding profits. Uber’s second quarter earnings release also broadly stunk, calling into question whether the company will ever turn a profit (especially amid fresh worries about new worker laws in California that have taken hold in September).

The only somewhat decent trades put on by millennials in September were Disney (DIS), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) — all three powerhouses generally traded in line to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.

“Just like their parents, millennials were taught buy what you know. Uber sold off, so many investors came in to buy it. If you’re going to be buying a stock, you should be buying it when a stock sells off, not wait until it’s at/near the top,” explained TD Ameritrade chief markets strategist JJ Kinahan of the action last month.

Kinahan added, “When you’re very familiar with the product, and have done some investigation into the business model, investors may want to consider tempering their enthusiasm on some of these stocks until they show profits longer-term. Finally, keep in mind a time frame – retail traders need to ask themselves if this is a name they are going to hold for a while or is it something they are trying to trade really quickly? While retail traders may have a price in mind, one of the most common mistakes we see at that retail traders make is that they don’t necessarily have a time frame in mind.”

But the performances of Aurora, Canopy Growth and Uber suggest millennials enter the fall with a good bit of losses in their trading accounts.

Overall, retail investors on the TD Ameritrade platform were net buyers of Disney, Amazon, Microsoft, Beyond Meat and Uber. So in effect, more experienced traders were also left holding the bag on once hyped names in the market. TD Ameritrade’s Investor Movement Index inched up to 4.62 in July, suggesting traders began to wade back into the market once the August selling subsided.

The Investor Movement Index measures trading activity from 11 million accounts on the TD Ameritrade platform.

But to take advantage of the service, you’ll need a Fitbit device — which is where the new Versa 2 comes in.

Available for $199, the Versa 2 is Fitbit’s latest take on the smartwatch genre. I’ve been wearing the Versa 2 for the better part of a week, day and night, and despite a few nitpicky flaws — I really wish it showed more information about my workouts on a single screen — it offers tons of functionality in an inexpensive package.

But we can’t talk about smartwatches without bringing up the market leader, the Apple Watch (AAPL), which starts at $279 for a Series 3 and $399 for a Series 4. And while the Versa 2 holds its own against Apple’s offering — its battery and sleep tracking are beyond the Apple Watch’s capabilities — the one you choose will largely come down to how much you’re willing to spend on a smartwatch.

The Versa 2’s design

Fitbit has been evolving the look of its smartwatches over the last few generations to make them appear less sporty, and more like something you’d wear at the office, a barbecue, or formal occasion. The company offers a slew of optional bands made from a variety of materials including leather, suede, and stainless steel, that are, mercifully, easier to swap out than the previous generation of replacement bands.

The Versa 2’s overall look is also rounder and more refined. The Fitbit Blaze, the company’s discontinued watch, and Fitbit Ionic, a sporty smartwatch, were boxy and, in retrospect, looked more like what people from the ‘90s thought smartwatches should look like.

The Versa line, and especially the Versa 2, has softer angles, and sits more comfortably on your wrist. In fact, there were more than a few times when I showed the Versa 2 to people only to have them ask “Isn’t that the Apple Watch?” Whether that’s a positive or not depends on if you like the look of the Apple Watch. And since I do, I‘m giving the Versa 2 points for style.

The biggest improvement to the Versa 2 over its predecessors is Fitbit’s decision to use an AMOLED display rather than a standard LCD panel. That not only enhances colors on the watch, since AMOLED screens can produce more vibrant hues, but it also helps with battery life. That’s because AMOLED displays consume less power than LCD panels.

That AMOLED screen also gives you the option of setting the Versa 2’s display to always-on mode, which continuously shows a black and white time readout, as well as your activity and step goals.

It’s nice to be able to see the time quickly without having to raise your wrist, but it also turns off the watch’s raise-to-view functionality. That means if you want to check out certain apps on the Versa 2, you’ll have to either double-tap the display or press the watch’s side button. It’s a minor annoyance, but struck me as odd for an otherwise well-designed feature.

Bottom line: Spence thinks Sonos (SONO) deserves more respect on the Street because it’s not simply a hardware company.

“I don’t think investors necessarily understand our business, we have only been public for a year. We are starting to see some of them understand it,” Spence said on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. “But we are living in a world where there are a lot of software companies and that’s the shine of the moment. The hardware space has been damaged by how some have approached the space and not delivered on what they said they would. We have delivered on what we said we would as a public company.”

To Spence’s point, Sonos is starting to deliver in a big way. In doing so, the company should begin tamping down worries on Wall Street that it just sells speakers and is too slow on getting new products to market. Sonos unveiled the $399 Move today, it’s first ever portable speaker that takes aim at offerings from Bose and Apple’s Beats. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley gives the Move high marks for its power and ease of use. Spence said the debut is big for Sonos, an entry into an entirely new market.

The Move launch comes on the heels of Sonos’ entry into the mass market via a tie-up with Ikea several weeks ago. Sonos and Ikea joined forces to build two pieces of furniture that come equipped with a Sonos smart speaker inside. The relatively low price points for the products, Spence said, are likely to drive more people into the Sonos brand for the first time. That should position Sonos to capitalize on those consumers looking to trade up to its more expensive home theater and smart speaker offerings over the long-term.

Sonos’ growing product momentum is taking hold in its financials. For the nine months ended June 29, Sonos’ operating profits clocked in at $30.5 million versus a loss of $9.1 million a year earlier. Fiscal third quarter sales increased solidly in all four of Sonos’ product categories: wireless speakers, home theater, components and other.

“We are incrementally more positive given an improved product cycle via the IKEA partnership, consistent quarterly execution, and a reasonable valuation. While we question the recurring nature of the business, we believe that the IKEA partnership will help expand SONO's addressable market,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note to clients.

With Sonos shares up about 50% this year, it shows at least some investors are finally understanding the company. As more get it, Sonos’ shares could be looking at another 50% move higher over the next 12-months.

But none of those is built to be taken outside. That’s where the new Sonos Move comes in. An indoor and outdoor speaker, the Move automatically adjusts its audio levels based on where you place it.

What’s more, Sonos says the Move can survive drops, spills, getting blasted with dust, and even being soaked with a hose. The price for that kind of sound quality durability? $399. Pricey. In fact, competing offerings from Bose top out at $349. But based on my brief experience listening to the Move, it may be worth it.

Big sound, big package

The Sonos Move is a portable speaker, but it’s not one of those tiny bluetooth speakers you can throw in your backpack and take to the beach. This is a beefy unit that requires at least one arm to carry. A handle on the rear of the unit makes it a little easier to bring with you, but its bulk is definitely something you want to take into account.

That big size, however, also means the Move has plenty of room to push out serious sound. The unit has a downward-firing tweeter that pushes audio into a specially crafted waveguide that helps more evenly reflect higher frequency sounds. Sonos says that the waveguide ensures that high frequency audio is able to reflect off a surface, making sound clearer for listeners.

The Sonos Move is the company's first portable speaker, and starts at $399. (Image: Howley) More

That’s because in outdoor environments there typically aren’t many walls for sound to bounce off of, which can impact overall audio quality and make music sound dull or muted. The waveguide helps overcome that.

Sonos also poured the power on with the Move, allowing it to reach volume levels that sound downright uncomfortable indoors.

Outdoors, though, that extra power can mean the difference between being able to hear songs clearly or having them sound muffled.

Sonos has equipped the Move with the company’s TruePlay technology, but this time around, the feature will automatically adjust the speaker’s audio quality based on its location.

To use TruePlay with Sonos’s other products you normally need to use an iOS device to act as a microphone that can capture the way sound reflects off surfaces in your home.

TruePlay would then create a sound profile for your room that uses the equalizer and filters to ensure you get the best possible sound regardless of where the speaker is placed.

With the Move, however, you don’t need to use your smartphone. Instead, the device uses four built-in microphones to capture the way sound reflects inside and outside, and create an audio profile. In a demonstration, a Sonos representative took a Move playing music on a TV stand and placed it in a cubby.

When TruePlay kicked in, the sound automatically adjusted to make for a better listening experience.

Take it with you

In order for the Sonos Move to be considered a portable speaker, Sonos wanted to make sure it could stand up to the rigors of life during a family barbecue or pool party. According to the company, the Move can survive being dropped, covered in dust, sprayed down with water, and covered in everything from ketchup to mustard."

Here are the mosts important numbers from the company’s first report.

Revenue: $145 million versus $141.5 million (expected)

Adjusted losses per share: $0.14 versus $0.19 (expected)

In spite of numbers that looked relatively encouraging, the stock plunged as much as 13% in after hours trading, as the company’s third quarter outlook showed a loss that is slightly more than current estimates. The stock closed up 8% on the day at $31.07.

Slack’s Q3 2020 guidance called for a loss of between $0.08 per share and $0.09 per share. Analysts, however, were looking for expected losses $0.07 per share.

Basically, Slack’s business model involves offering its office collaboration services to smaller businesses for free, while charging large organizations and those looking for increased functionality.

Slack More

In its S1 filing, the company revealed that as of January 2019, more than 500,000 organizations used the free version of the messaging service.

As of April, Slack had as many as 95,000 paid customer organizations. In the three months ending in April 2019, 43% of Slack’s revenue came from 645 paid organizations that spent more than $100,000 annually.

According to Bloomberg, that’s about 1% of Slack’s total customer base. The company is expected to add 75 customers that paid more than $100,000 annually in Q2 2020, versus 61 in the comparable year-ago quarter.

Bloomberg project’s Slack’s sales will slow in the near term as it continues to expand in the enterprise space, with the company seeing a 52% increase in fiscal 2020 compared to an 82% in 2019. Sales are expected to continue to slow in 37% in 2021.

Slack has a good deal of competition in the enterprise messaging space. One of its biggest competitors is Microsoft (MSFT), which has a solid chance at cutting off Slack’s business via its Teams enterprise messaging service.

Both Slack and Teams offer third-party app integration, and can be used either free or via a subscription with enhanced functionality.

Like Lyft and Uber, both of which also filed IPOs this year, Slack has admitted it doesn’t currently make any money — and there’s the risk that it never will. It all depends on how many enterprise customers the company can convince to spend on its service.

The Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku Wireless Subwoofer are designed to enhance the sound quality of your shows, movies, and music by pumping out clearer and deeper audio than your TV’s measly built-in speakers.

But it’s the price of these new offerings that’s sure to catch consumers’ eyes. At $179 each, the soundbar and subwoofer are priced at a sweet spot that should capture plenty of attention. Similar setups can cost upwards of $400.

The Roku Smart Soundbar starts at $179 and features a built-in Roku streaming player. (Image: Roku) More

The soundbar itself also doubles as a Roku player, so you can use it to control everything from Netflix and Hulu to upcoming services like Disney+ and Apple TV+.

What’s more, buying Roku speakers gives users more of an incentive to stick with the streaming service, helping to keep the company’s platform reach stable.

Bring the noise

Roku is no stranger to audio products. Last year, the company launched its Roku TV Wireless Speakers for $199. The speakers were a fantastic product, offering drastically improved audio quality to my standard TV speakers. But there was just one problem: They only worked with Roku TVs.

That means if you had a Samsung, LG, Sony, or any other TV not powered by Roku’s operating system, you couldn’t get the speakers. It was a bummer to say the least.

The Roku Smart Soundbar, however, works with any TV as long as you have an HDMI ARC port or optical audio port. ARC stands for audio return channel and allows you to use a single HDMI port to connect a speaker to your TV. Once connected via the ARC port, your speaker will work with every other product connected to your TV, as well.

Say, for instance, you have a game console and want the audio to output through your soundbar. The ARC port lets you do that with a single cable, since it is taking the audio information sent from the console to the TV and pushing it through your speaker.

Roku's Wireless Subwoofer offers a big bass boost. (Image: Roku) More

ARC has been around for some time, so chances are your TV has it and you just didn’t realize it. I know I didn’t. If you don’t have an ARC-compatible HDMI port, however, you can output audio to the Roku Smart Soundbar via your TV’s optical audio jack.

I listened to a demo using the Soundbar connected to a Samsung TV, and the extra power from the bar’s four 2.5-inch drivers helped add a needed boost to the TV’s audio quality.

Today’s razor-thin television designs mean there is less room for built-in speakers. The smaller the speakers, the narrower the range and level of audio they can push out.

With the Roku Smart Soundbar connected to the demo TV, dialogue and ambient sounds in “Blade Runner 2049” were clearer. Machine gun fire and the sound of a vehicle crashing also had a satisfying amount of bass. You’re not getting that out of most built-in TV speakers.

Roku’s Subwoofer is designed to add even deeper bass hits to your sound system via its 10-inch, downward-firing driver. This beastly speaker wirelessly connects to the Soundbar.

Roku says you can place the Subwoofer anywhere in your room, and it will fill the space with sound, since low-frequency audio is nondirectional."

(Photo: CARL DE SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images)

An unprecedented number of fires are ravaging the Amazon rainforest over the last few weeks, most of which were lit by local farmers to clear areas for cattle.

Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported that the nation has experienced more than 75,000 fires so far in 2019, with more than half of those raging in Brazil’s Amazon region.

Experts warn that the massive fires have the ability to severely inhibit the planet’s overall health given that the Amazon spans eight countries — or about 40% of South America — and produces more than 20% of the planet’s oxygen.

And people are increasingly asking what can be done about it.

“This is a red alert and we should use this time to educate the world on such an important cause,” Adriane Muelbert, a Brazilian-born ecologist with UK’s University of Birmingham who’s studied how Amazon deforestation plays a role in climate change for the last seven years, told Yahoo Finance.

‘The Amazon is a very important place’

Muelbert added that the Amazon “is a very important place for the planet and it’s one of our most valuable weapons to fight climate change at the moment.” Deforestation has contributed to a 17% decline in the rainforest’s total area over the last 50 years, according to World Wildlife Fund.

The full extent of the damage caused by these fires cannot be calculated until after the fires are extinguished. And Muelbert noted that this is only the beginning of fire season and the situation has the potential to get much worse.

“This is not a dry year and in dry years we expect fires, but rainfall has been above average this year” Muelbert said, noting that she considers the fires an environmental anomaly.

In São Paulo, more than 1,000 miles away from the infernos, people are sharing dramatic images of thick smoke clouds and black rainwater linked to the fires.

How normal folks can help

Calls to action from celebrities like Madonna and Leonardo DiCaprio have gained coverage, but people outside of Brazil might feel confused on how to start.

Kathryn Kellogg, a zero-waste activist, told Yahoo Finance that any “step in the right direction is still a step in the right direction.” She asserted that it’s neither time-consuming nor expensive to adopt a lifestyle that’s centered around “saving and using what you have instead of constantly buying new.”

Here are some tips for anyone who wants to help shake dependency on materials sourced from the Amazon and leave behind a smaller footprint.

Reduce the amount of paper you use

Cut your dependence on trees and go paperless or try to use recycled paper.

Make use of online and automated bill pay, elect to receive e-statements instead of paper and put a stop to junk mail with the aid of DMAchoice, a non-profit dedicated to ending unwanted direct mail.

Curb your meat consumption

Muelbert noted that meat eaters should make informed decisions about where their meat is sourced. Cattle ranching is responsible for 80% of the ongoing deforestation and contributes to the crisis in the Amazon rainforest. Trees are cut and the land is converted into cattle ranches that supply the world’s mounting demand for beef. Eating less meat is one way to not contribute to the deforestation horrors."

77,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-prices-ipo-230106293.html,2019-09-25T23:31:01+00:00,"Peloton prices IPO at $29 per share, at high end of expected range","Peloton priced its initial public offering at $29 per share, the company said in a press release late Wednesday, making it the latest startup valued over $1 billion to tap the public markets.

Peloton, an indoor exercise equipment company offering digital workout subscriptions, is set to have class A shares begin trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker “PTON” during market hours Thursday. The company also has class B common shares, which offer 20 votes apiece, held by executives and early investors.

The pricing lies at the high end of the expected $26 to $29 per share range the company had been targeting. Peloton sold 40 million Class A shares, raising $1.16 billion in the offering and giving the company a valuation north of $8 billion.

Peloton has raised $994 million in venture capital funding, and was last valued in private markets at $4.15 billion in August 2018, according to Pitchbook. That makes it a “unicorn” — putting it in the same category as Uber and Lyft when they first went public. Just like those companies, Peloton has yet to turn a profit.

Goldman Sachs (GS) and J.P.Morgan Securities (JPM) are serving as lead underwriters for the IPO.

Public prospects

Founded in 2012, the New York-based company has since amassed more than 511,000 “connected fitness subscribers” tuning in for Peloton’s streamed workout classes.

Peloton’s exercise equipment sells for around $2,000 for its flagship stationary bicycle, and $4,000 for its newer treadmill — with subscribers then shelling out an additional $39 per month for classes. During fiscal year 2019, the company cited a customer acquisition cost of just $5 per connected fitness subscriber.

But while the equipment comes at a premium price tag for consumers, those sales haven’t yet translated into profits for Peloton.

Peloton priced its IPO Wednesday evening. Shares are set to begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""PTON."" More

The company has run at a loss since inception, and posted a net loss of $195.6 million for the year ending in June, more than quadrupling that of the year prior.

But top-line growth has also been robust, with revenue more than doubling to $915 million during the period.

Peloton’s margins have also been pressured, with some analysts suggesting there’s more of that in store as the company launches more live-studio content, and ramps up its apparel business.

The red ink puts Peloton in the company of other highly valued tech companies that hit the public markets this year, including Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) and Slack (WORK).

These companies have so far seen their stock prices punished by investors demanding clearer near-term paths to profitability: Uber and Lyft shares each trade below their IPO pricing. And at around $22 apiece, Slack’s shares trade well below their opening trade price of $38.50 from the company’s April direct listing.

The timing of Peloton’s IPO also comes just following a debacle for WeWork’s parent company as it sought its own public listing, with the office-leasing company’s high-flying private market valuation coming under scrutiny ahead of its listing. The company has since at least temporarily shelved the offering and replaced its CEO Adam Neumann with two newly elevated executives.

But external factors aside, other questions have also arisen around Peloton’s public prospects. The company said in its S-1 it believes its total addressable market is 67 million households, including 45 million in the U.S. — a figure that some analysts have called overly ambitious given the high price point for the products and services.

The company is also grappling with ongoing legal battles over music licensing in its workout videos.

Click here to start your free trial* and step up your investing.

Market breadth remains supportive of higher stock prices despite lackluster price action. The ""steady as she goes"" advance/decline (AD) lines are all at or near all-time highs. These include the S&P 500, the NYSE common-stock only, the S&P 400 MidCap and the S&P 600 SmallCap (SML) AD lines. All these lines continue to lead price, which is generally bullish for future returns. The McClellan Summation Index is derived from the McClellan Oscillator, which is a breadth indicator based on net advances on the NYSE Composite. The summation index is simply a running total of the oscillator values. At Friday's close, the summation index stood at a bullish +782 and above its eight-week exponential moving average.

There are many ways to read this indicator, including its absolute level, its direction, centerline crossovers (0), and bullish and bearish divergences. The index cycled from an extreme oversold at the end of '18 to an extreme overbought in February. That type of ""breadth thrust"" is considered bullish for at least the intermediate term. Since Feb., the index has pulled back between 230 and 800, bullishly staying above zero. Bearish divergences generally are seen at I.T./L.T. tops and can take months/year(s) to play out depending on the size of the top. The index is rising, above key averages, and not showing bearish divergences -- suggesting further upside in the NYSE and the overall market. The S&P 500 Bullish Percent Index (percent of stocks on point-and-figure buy signals) has rebounded to a bullish level of 69% from 46% in August.

Advance Auto Parts (AAP)

Advance Auto Parts is a leading retailer of auto parts in the U.S. AAP operated 5,901 stores and branches at the end of 2018, serving both the do-it-yourself and the professional installer markets under the Advance Auto Parts, Carquest, World Pac and Autopart Int’l. nameplates. Stores are in 49 states and Canada.

AAP is a technical turnaround play, recovering from a decline from $181 in April to $130 in August. It appears the stock turned the corner on August 13, following quarterly EPS results. The shares have almost recovered 61.8% (to $162) of the major loss this year, a typical Fibonacci retracement. There is chart resistance in the $163 area, so the stock is in a key region. The rally Monday recaptured the 200-day average for the first time since May. If the stock can take resistance at $163, AAP could head back to its intermediate range in the low $180’s.

Support sits near $150 and we would put a stop-loss just below that area. We would take profits in the $180 region after $163 (discussed above) is addressed.

First Solar (FSLR)

First Solar designs and makes a line of thin-film semiconductor photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules that convert sunlight into electricity. Products are based on cadmium telluride technology, and are used to provide reliable and environmentally friendly electric power.

FSLR is tracing out a bullish cup between $59 and $69. Volume has increased on the right or rising side of the pattern, a sign of institutional accumulation. During the cup, the shares lost their 50- day but did find support from their 21-week exponential moving average. A strong break above the top of the recent range at $69 opens the door for a possible measured move to the high $70’s/low $80’s area, where there is a large amount of resistance from the peaks in 2014, 2016 and 2018. According to Investors.com, FSLR has very high Relative Strength (RS) and Group RS ratings, and high Composite and Accumulation/Distribution ratings.

We would put a stop-loss just below support at $62. We would take profits in the high $70’s region once near-term resistance at $69 is overcome.

Responding to a question from an NBC reporter about his thoughts on the impeachment discussion, the husband of 2016 Democratic Candidate (and former Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton replied: “It’s gonna be looked into, and it should be looked into.”

The 42nd president of the U.S., who was part of a panel on Colombia at the Bloomberg Global Economic Forum in New York City, found himself impeached by the House in 1998 and later acquitted by the Senate.

The former president’s comments come on the back of news on Tuesday, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House will launch a formal impeachment inquiry after news that Trump possibly pressuring Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.

Thus far, no American president has ever been removed from office due to an impeachment and conviction.

A president becomes impeached if the House votes on one or more articles of impeachment and one of those articles receives a majority vote.

Then the Senate holds a trail overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court with lawmakers from the House serve as prosecutors, the president has defense lawyers, and the Senate is the jury.

Only if two-thirds of the Senate find the impeached president guilty would he or she be removed from office. In that case, the vice president would assume the office as president.

U.S. stocks initially reversed an early rally Tuesday and sold off on news of the pending impeachment announcement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but after investors had a night to sleep on it, they bid stocks higher the very next day.

In fact, all three major stock indexes rose Wednesday, with the Dow closing more than 150 points higher.

“I just don’t think it’s an event for the markets,” David Waddell, chief investment strategist at Waddell Associates, tells Yahoo Finance’s “The First Trade.”

“It’s another vaudeville act in the political circus and the markets build up some callouses around this,” says Waddell.

Market watchers say the sheer shock value of the impeachment news just isn’t there. “I think if this came out of nowhere, and we didn’t have the past two to three years of political theater, this would really be throwing markets off,” says Shawn Cruz, manager of trade strategy at TD Ameritrade.

Gridlock coming

One thing investors do appear to be certain about – now that lawmakers are focused on impeachment proceedings – is that little else will be accomplished in Congress.

“If nothing else it creates gridlock, which could actually be good for some sectors,” says Cruz. “Think about health care, right now they don’t want any progress made on the legislative front for them.”

Cruz says traders will likely favor defensive stocks in the short term, and shun riskier trades that are more sensitive to geopolitical uncertainty.

The impeachment news doesn’t change the investment narrative for JP Morgan analyst John Normand.

“There is no change to overall investment recommendations, which are only moderately cyclical given previous geopolitical and now political constraints on the business and profit cycles,” Normand wrote in a note.

Effect on trade

For some on Wall Street, the impeachment inquiry only matters in terms of how it affects trade talks with China.

“If the perception is that Trump really does have a weaker hand, then it becomes more of a photo-op agreement and less a fundamental agreement,” Waddell says.

Investors are also betting on the impeachment process taking months to unfold, and that the odds of it passing a Republican-held Senate are slim.

The two prior times Congress brought impeachment proceedings against a president, market reaction was very different. Experts are quick to point out that may be because their economic backdrops were also very different.

“During the Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started,” Neil Dutta, Renaissance Macro Research head of economics, wrote in an email.

“During the Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed,” he said. “Perhaps these political events are eventually overwhelmed by the fundamentals?”

The three major indices earlier in the session had fluctuated between advances and losses.

The Dow surged mid-morning in New York after Trump told reporters at the UN in New York that a China deal could happen “sooner than you think,” according to Bloomberg. Gains in shares of Nike (NKE) following better-than-expected quarterly results also helped add to advances.

Here’s where the market settled at the end of regular equity trading:

S&P 500 (^GSPC): +0.62%, or 18.28 points

Dow (^DJI): +0.61%, or 163.01 points

10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): +9.4 bps to 1.729%

Gold (GC=F): -1.86% to $1,511.50 per ounce

Tuesday after market hours, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. The inquiry was spurred by a whistleblower report that Trump pressured Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate potential 2020 presidential opponent Joe Biden and his son. The whistleblower could testify before Congress as soon as this week, according to a Twitter post from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Tuesday.

White House released the unredacted memorandum of the call on Wednesday.

The memo showed that Trump asked Zelensky to “look into” Biden and his son. Trump added he would have his lawyer and attorney general connect with Zalensky to “get to the bottom” of the situation.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said, according to the transcript.

Meanwhile, Trump had confirmed earlier Tuesday that he had withheld military aid from Ukraine, but said that this was because of his view that the U.S. was contributing more to the country than were other European nations. The notes from the call did not show Trump making an explicit link predicating further U.S. aid on an investigation of Biden and his son.

‘Unique context’

The overhang of a formal impeachment inquiry has injected further uncertainty into markets, contributing to the S&P 500’s steepest loss since August on Tuesday.

However, most have pointed out that the impeachment process could take months to unfold, and that the likelihood of it furthering past the Republican-majority Senate remains dubious.

“There is no change to overall investment recommendations, which are only moderately cyclical given previous geopolitical and now political constraints on the business and profit cycles,” JPMorgan analyst John Normand wrote in a note.

But that said, the impeachment inquiry also occurs within a “unique context” in global markets that “now includes four elements – global growth slowdown, classic late-cycle vulnerabilities, high market valuations but somewhat defensive investor positioning,” Normand added.

“It would be complacent to think that the impeachment process just adds another ring to the circus and will prove inconsequential for markets into 2020,” he said. He highlighted “wildcards” that have arisen as a result of the inquiry, including added uncertainty around U.S.-China trade and U.S.-Iran relations, as well as for the 2020 presidential and Senate elections.

History provides little indication as to the direction of the stock market amid a presidential impeachment inquiry. The two previous incidences – during the Nixon and Clinton administrations – yielded two different results.

“During the Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started,” Neil Dutta, Renaissance Macro Research head of economics, wrote in an email. “During the Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed. Perhaps these political events are eventually overwhelmed by the fundamentals?”

“You’ve got a felon acting lawlessly as the chief executive of the United States,” Scaramucci told Yahoo Finance’s On the Move.

The founder of Skybridge Capital and, famously, White House Communications Director for 11 days, recently changed his tune on his former boss and has been calling for a different Republican nominee for president. Trump’s call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked the leader to “do us a favor” and investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden has given Scaramucci new ammunition.

“I do believe in the next one to three months, the Republicans are going to throw in the towel, they really don’t have a choice,” he said. “If they want to win the presidential election, they can’t win it with Donald Trump.”

Scaramucci repeated his prediction that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will offer some sort of deal to the president to stand down and not run for re-election. “You’ve gotta get a group of Republicans that were running in 2024 to run in 2020 in a fair primary process and one of those people will emerge and compete against whoever the Democratic candidate is,” Scaramucci said.

Among Republicans in Congress, none have echoed Scaramucci’s concerns, although Utah Senator (and former presidential candidate) Mitt Romney said he found the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call to be “deeply troubling.”

Amazon (AMZN) is creating a virtual clinic for employees and their dependents in the Seattle area, the company said on Wednesday, marking its latest foray into health care.

Amazon’s new site, Amazon Care, details four different app-based service options such as chat, video, mobile and a courier service that delivers prescriptions. The company is contracting with a local provider, Oasis Medical, to manage the program.

An Amazon spokesperson told Yahoo Finance the new pilot will help employees get faster access to health care.

“We’re currently piloting a healthcare benefit designed to help Amazon employees get fast access to healthcare without an appointment, at the convenience of their schedules, at their preferred location” either on-site or working remotely, according to the spokesperson.

“Amazon Care eliminates travel and wait time, connecting employees and their family members to a physician or nurse practitioner through live chat or video, with the option for in-person follow up services from a registered nurse ranging from immunizations to instant strep throat detection,” the spokesperson added.

Though services are currently only available in Seattle, the company said it intends to expand services throughout the country for employees.

On-site clinics have existed at major companies for years — a particular staple at manufacturing plants, where work-related injuries were treated. As those jobs decreased, the need for onsite care decreased as well.

But there has been a resurgence in the trend of on-site primary care services—largely through third-party providers—in what is seen as a cost-saving move for employers.

Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit on October 10 More

With primary care services in place, companies allow employees access to health care without needing to take time off of work, and it prevents costly emergency care visits from neglected symptoms or issues.

A recent survey of 109 companies from the Texas-based National Association of Worksite Health Centers showed that almost three quarters said they have onsite clinics. According to the poll, 45 percent said they plan to add a site in the next two years.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

President Trump is threatening America’s love affair with cheese. The trade war with China has already rattled Americans. Consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in nine months in September. The opening of an official impeachment inquiry by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday is doing little to calm nerves either.

Those seeking out cheese platters or stringy delicious goodness on pizza to cope, may lose that comfort food, too.

The American cheese industry is bracing for costs from additional tariffs next month after the recent World Trade Organization ruling in favor of Trump’s bid to impose tariffs on European products. The move is meant to offset subsidies to European aerospace giant Airbus which Boeing has referred to as illegal. “The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!” Trump said in April.

The WTO will make its official ruling public next week, but has already authorized the U.S. to impose tariffs on nearly $8 billion of European products.

The U.S. Trade Representative’s office hasn’t yet officially announced which goods will be impacted, but it has proposed placing tariffs on planes, wine, leather goods and other European imports. The EU is likely to hit back with its own set of retaliatory tariffs.

Cheese has also landed in the crosshairs of Trump’s dispute with the European Union.

The top-selling cheeses that could be impacted include Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano Reggiano from Italy, French Brie, and Gouda from the Netherlands. The cost of doing business in the cheese industry would double should Trump choose to impose the additional 100% tariff. The added tariff would cost importers $1 billion annually, according to the Cheese Importers Association of America, a trade group.

$40 per pound

Most specialty cheese from Europe costs between $10 to $19 a pound. If U.S. importers couldn’t afford to absorb the higher cost of tariffs, they might decide to pass them onto consumers. The Cheese Importers Association of America estimates that European cheese prices would increase to $20 to $40 per pound. Importers fear that consumers might balk at those prices.

The $1 billion of cheese imports the USTR is targeting for tariffs generates over $3.5 billion in revenue for U.S. businesses, like trucking companies, importers, supermarkets, and restaurants. Higher tariffs eat into margins and would result in the loss of over 20,000 jobs, according to the Cheese Importers Association of America.

Airplane subsidies

How cheese and other food products like wine and olive oil became Trump targets continues to stump importers who say those food items have nothing to do with the airplane dispute Trump wants to punish Europe for.

“Why bring in all these other types of products and everything else when it has nothing to do with the aerospace industry. If you have a problem with regard to agriculture and the United States wants more access to Europe, that’s a separate issue. Don’t affect people that have been in business for years,” says Phil Marfuggi, president of the Cheese Importers Association of America.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public, according to the Justice Department memo, which referred only to a single phone call between Mr. Trump and an unnamed foreign leader .

Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had “abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,” the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.

In their first public comments, lawyers for the whistle-blower said their client hoped to remain anonymous but wanted to continue to cooperate with lawmakers conducting oversight.

Mr. Trump had brought up American aid to Ukraine with Mr. Zelensky — without mentioning that at the time he was blocking delivery of a large military assistance package that Congress had approved to help it fend off Russian aggression — and suggested that Ukraine could be doing more to help the United States, the reconstructed transcript of the call indicated."

Mike Quigley on Wednesday described the whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's communications with Ukraine as ""deeply disturbing"" after viewing the document.

""I can't detail what it involves. Period,"" Quigley told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""I will tell people that it is deeply disturbing. It reinforces the concerns that what we previously learned and I think it is a blueprint for what we still need to know.""

Quigley asserted the whistleblower complaint ""is the political equivalent"" of Trump's claim during his 2016 presidential campaign that he could ""stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody"" without losing voters.

""What the President said during the campaign, he said he could shoot someone on the street and his base would stay with him. I guess what I read, to me, was the political equivalent of that: defying the constitution, committing a criminal act and thinking, 'Well I can get away with it,' "" he said. ""Some sort of bizarre cult of personality. Deeply disturbing what we read this morning. Alarming.""

The whistleblower complaint -- which was hand-delivered to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for lawmakers to review -- deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. A transcript of the conversation released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

“I’ve read the summary of the call. If this is the ‘launching point’ for House Democrats’ impeachment process, they’ve already overplayed their hand. It’s clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for,” McConnell said in a statement for this story.

Those comments come on the heels of McConnell allowing a nonbinding sense of the Senate resolution to pass on Tuesday that directed the Trump administration to share a whistleblower complaint about Trump’s interactions with foreign leaders with congressional intelligence committees.

McConnell confidant s said allowing the resolution through was harmless while blocking it could have attracted unwanted attention; the whistleblower complaint arrived on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

Reading the tea leaves, Democrats say the move was evidence McConnell is feeling the heat on the president’s conduct. But Republicans aren’t so sure.

“He’s got ice in his veins. I’ve never seen anybody like it,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who’s only served along McConnell in the Senate for nine months. “He’s seen it all, so he doesn’t panic.”

Trump and McConnell have developed a real partnership over the past two years that has proven durable despite Trump occasionally dinging McConnell for not repealing Obamacare or eliminating the filibuster. McConnell and Trump speak with some frequency about legislation, nominations and Senate races, and Trump often counts McConnell as a close political adviser.

It’s not clear whether McConnell and Trump have discussed the Ukraine controversy, but McConnell has put at least some daylight between them on the issue. On the Senate floor this week, the Kentucky Republican said he personally urged the Defense secretary and the secretary of State to release military aid to Ukraine, which had been reportedly withheld at Trump’s behest.

But what does McConnell think about the very real possibility that his chamber will have to hold an impeachment trial in the coming months? Long-serving senators say they’ve given up trying to divine his next move.

“If he’s concerned about it, nobody should ever know,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) “And if he’s not concerned about it, you’re not going to know.”

Plus, McConnell knows whatever he tells his members at party meetings may go public, so he’s keeping even many in his own party on their toes.

That leaves everyone guessing about what McConnell will do next as he surveys his own reelection campaign, a defense of his Senate majority and a coming clash with House Democrats who appear increasingly likely to impeach the president.

poster=""https://static.politico.com/92/57/22be714845deaf4fee508833483a/artboard-3.png""

“He’s never rattled,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), one of McConnell’s closest friends in the Senate for more than a decade. “I don’t expect Sen. McConnell to be rattled. I don’t think he is.”

McConnell’s decision to allow the whistleblower resolution through “is a pretty good signal that there is concern among Republicans,” argued Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “Most of us [were] expecting him to oppose it. As he has done every effort to seek transparency.”

On Wednesday morning, McConnell declined to answer a question about whether the Senate will hold an impeachment trial, a gray area in the Senate’s impeachment rules. Most Republicans think the Senate would respond in some way if the House impeaches the president rather than try to ignore it.

But there’s been no real discussion about that among Senate Republicans with McConnell. In fact, other than guidance from Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) there’s been little real discussion among Senate Republicans about the slog that’s before them.

McConnell doesn’t want to get out in front of a rapidly changing storyline. In just the past week, the whistleblower story fully emerged, Trump confirmed reports that he mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden in his discussions with President Volodymyr Zelensky and then released a White House summary of that very conversation. On Thursday , the Senate Intelligence Committee will hear from the acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.

“Everybody, including the leader, should be trying to get as many facts about this one issue collected as quickly as we can and not reaching very many conclusions on it until we get them,” said one Republican senator. And “Mitch is instinctively careful anyway.”

But rank-and-file senators have been reacting on the fly, with a span of comments ranging from Mitt Romney (R-Utah) saying he is “troubled in the extreme” by Trump bringing up Biden to Zelensky to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) decrying “another pathetic attempt by Democrats to destroy President Trump with falsehoods.”

“Would it have been better that he not brought up Biden’s name? Yes. But the rush to judgment by the other body I think is totally unwarranted,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who had questioned Trump personally about why aid to Ukraine was held up. “You’re talking about changing the results of an election of the United States. Pretty serious.""

Trump is intensely interested in the mood on the Hill, calling at least two Senate Republicans directly on Tuesday evening ahead of the transcript’s release, according to people familiar with the conversations, and dialing into a White House meeting with congressional Republicans on Wednesday morning. It became clear at a party lunch that, Romney aside, the party for now has the president’s back.

“The feeling in the room was relief. We all were told that this is some kind of shakedown by Trump,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

“You’re talking about changing the results of an election of the United States. Pretty serious."" - Sen. Rob Portman

McConnell’s autobiography is called the “Long Game,” and it might as well describe how he’s going to handle the road to a potential impeachment trial. Foremost on the majority leader’s mind this week is funding the government past Sept. 30, no easy task given the failure of the House and Senate to agree on spending bills.

Instead the GOP leader has to rally support for an unpopular continuing resolution.

“I don’t think it’s a lay-up by any stretch. Hell, we’ve got 20 people that don’t vote for appropriations,” Cramer said. “I do think his personal attention and energy are probably more focused on getting through the week, getting things done that we need.”

Few would say that funding the government is not a priority. But Democrats say that McConnell’s shrug at Trump’s conversation with Zelensky as the House moves toward impeachment underscores their devil’s bargain with the president.

“I know what a lot of them think personally of him, that he’s an embarrassment and he’s bad for the country,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said of Republicans. ""But they get their tax cuts and their young right-wing extremist judges.”

Updated at 9:03 p.m. ET

Earlier this week, President Trump cited concerns about corruption as his rationale for blocking security assistance to Ukraine. But in a letter sent to four congressional committees in May of this year and obtained by NPR, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy John Rood informed lawmakers that he ""certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption [and] increasing accountability.""

The certification was required by law for the release of $250 million in security assistance for Ukraine. That aid was blocked by the White House until Sept. 11 and has since been released. It must be spent before Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

At a news conference on Wednesday wrapping up a three-day visit to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump repeated his professed concerns about corruption as the reason for holding up $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine.

""We want to make sure that country is honest,"" Trump said of Ukraine. ""It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

The Defense Department announced in mid-June that it would be sending $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine, which has been battling pro-Russia separatists near its eastern border with Russia since 2014.

But the White House blocked that assistance in July. That was prior to a phone call Trump made to Ukraine's recently elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

According to notes of that call released by the White House on Wednesday, Trump asked Zelenskiy to ""look into"" reports that former vice president and current Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden ""went around bragging"" that he stopped the Ukrainian government from looking into his son Hunter's activities in Ukraine.

Trump has denied seeking to pressure Zelenskiy into carrying out such a probe by withholding the military assistance. That aid was released Sept. 11 after an angry bipartisan response from Congress to reports that the money was being withheld.

Some congressional Republicans are defending Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy. ""I think to suggest that this phone call was the president of the United States threatening to withhold aid to the Ukraine unless they did his political bidding,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., ""is simply ridiculous.""

Another explanation Trump has been giving for blocking the Ukraine assistance is his view that European allies are not contributing enough to that aid. ""Europe and other nations [must] contribute to Ukraine,"" he told reporters at the U.N. on Tuesday. ""Because they're not doing it. Just the United States. We're putting up the bulk of the money.""

Eight European embassies in Washington contacted by NPR on Wednesday reported no attempts by the Trump administration over the summer to increase their contributions to Ukraine. ""There was no effort at all,"" said a senior official at the German Embassy, who requested anonymity to speak freely. ""The topic was not brought up at all at recent meetings we've had.""

European diplomats hasten to point out that they have been contributing far more to Ukraine than what Trump has claimed. ""Our bilateral assistance to Ukraine of $1.4 billion is almost at the U.S. level,"" said the German Embassy official. The U.S. has disbursed nearly $1.5 billion since 2014 in security assistance to Ukraine, while the European Union has provided about $15 billion, mostly in the form of loans.

House committees that are starting impeachment inquiries are virtually certain to probe further into Trump's reasons for holding back assistance to Ukraine while he was seeking an investigation there of a potential Democratic rival in next year's election.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that reporters should ask Mike Pence to release details of his conversations with Ukraine, seemingly drawing his vice president into the scandal that has engulfed the administration.

“I think you should ask for Vice President Pence’s conversation, because he had a couple of conversations also,” Trump said at a news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. “I could save you a lot of time. They were all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.”

Story Continued Below

Trump also said he could be persuaded to release more information about an earlier conversation he had with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, while repeating that he did nothing inappropriate in his contacts with the foreign leader.

“The word is they’re going to ask for the first phone conversation,” Trump said at the news conference. “You can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence’s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect.”

The comments came hours after the White House released a memo detailing Trump’s July 25 conversation with Zelensky in which Trump pressured him to open an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. The document confirmed allegations that the president sought help from a foreign leader to investigate a political rival — allegations that convinced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

During the news conference, Trump revealed that the July 25 conversation was the second phone call between the two leaders and said he would release the first if prompted.

Some of Trump’s top aides have also been drawn into the scandal. The Washington Post reported that Trump asked his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine just days before the July 25 call with Zelensky, and the memo of Trump’s call showed the president urging Zelensky to work with Attorney General William Barr to investigate the Bidens."

“They want to make a deal very badly... It could happen sooner than you think,” Trump told reporters in New York.

Trump said later after signing a limited trade deal with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there was a good chance of reaching an agreement with China.

He said China was trying to be nice to him and added to reporters: “I was nice to them.”

“We’re having some very good conversations,” Trump told a later news conference.

“You know why they want to make a deal? Because they’re losing their jobs, because their supply chain is going to hell and companies are moving out of China and they’re moving to lots of other places, including the United States.”

In the meantime, Trump said, the United States was taking in “billions and billions of dollars in tariffs.”

“China is starting to buy our agricultural product again,” Trump added. “They’re starting to go with the beef and all of the different things, pork, very big on pork.”

“You know they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal. The question is, do we want to make a deal?”

Trump spoke a day after delivering a stinging rebuke to China’s trade practices at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a “bad deal” in U.S.-China trade negotiations.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said there was communication between the two sides and the Chinese would be in the United States for talks in early October.

“At this stage what you want to do is have confidence building and show goodwill, and I think ... we’re doing that,” he told reporters. “The president wants a deal if he can get a good deal. If he doesn’t ... we have a tariff policy in place.”

China’s top diplomat hit back at U.S. criticism of its trade and development model in a speech on Tuesday after Trump spoke at the United Nations. Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister and state councilor, said Beijing would not bow to threats, including on trade, though he said he hoped the high-level trade talks next month would produce positive results.

Wang also dismissed the concerns of those in the United States who worry that China will unseat the United States from its leading role in the world, calling it a strategic misjudgment. Asked about this remark, Trump said: “Maybe they just say that.”

The early October meetings are to include the top trade negotiators from both sides: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. They are expected to determine whether the world’s two largest economies are starting to chart a path out of their trade war or headed for new and higher tariffs on each others’ goods.

Trump has sought to pressure China to agree to reduce trade barriers through a policy of increasing tariffs on Chinese products. On Tuesday, he accused China of the theft of trade secrets “on a grand scale” and said it was taking advantage of World Trade Organization rules.

Although Trump held out hope in his U.N. speech that the United States and China could still reach an agreement, he made clear he wanted a deal that would rebalance the relationship between the two economic superpowers.

Wang said the trade war was inflicting unnecessary damage on both countries, raising costs for American firms, pushing up consumer prices and dampening U.S. growth potential."

A California man faces arson and attempted murder charges after allegedly lighting a homeless man's cardboard encampment on fire while the man was sleeping in it.

Richard Smallets, 32, was arrested in Glendale, California — less than 10 miles north of downtown Los Angeles — and is also accused of taking pictures of the blaze.

An investigation by the Glendale Police Department, per a press release issued Tuesday, said a homeless man awoke to the smell of smoke and found the cardboard box encampment he was sleeping under was on fire. The fire was set near the Museum of Neon Art.

The man unsuccessfully tried to put it out with bottled water, but the fire was later put out by the city's fire department.

A nearby business recorded footage of Smallets intentionally setting fire to the boxes, police say. After questioning, officers arrested Smallets in connection with the fire.

Smallets was charged with attempted murder and arson Sept. 13, and remains in custody. He is set to appear in court Wednesday. His bail is set at $1 million.

Glendale police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.

Israel's president on Wednesday tapped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attempt to form a new government. The move could give Netanyahu up to six weeks to haggle for political allies.

Israeli President Reuven Rivlin's selection of Netanyahu to assemble a governing coalition follows last week's election, in which voters deadlocked in trying to decide between Netanyahu and his main rival.

The election's inconclusive results threw into doubt the political future of Netanyahu, who has held power for more than a decade and is also facing possible indictment in three corruption cases.

Netanyahu narrowly won an election in April but failed to cobble together a majority in parliament and called for the election held Sept. 17. If he fails to form a government this time, Rivlin could ask Netanyahu's election opponent, Benny Gantz, or another member of the Israeli parliament to try to put together a government. Or it could result in another election, something Rivlin has said the country does not want.

On Wednesday, the final results of the election were released. Netanyahu's conservative Likud party won 32 seats, and Gantz's centrist Blue and White party picked up 33 seats in the country's 120-seat parliament.

But in early talks with the smaller parties to win seats, Netanyahu won the backing of 55 members to form a new government, while Gantz earned pledges for 54 seats.

Both results fell short of the 61 needed for a majority.

Next week, a hearing is scheduled in one of the bribery and fraud cases against Netanyahu. If he is charged, as the country's police have recommended, Netanyahu could remain in power while the case is pending.

In previous coalition talks, Netanyahu has sought assurances that his coalition partners would back a law giving him some immunity from prosecution.

One scenario in the coalition talks could be an alliance between Gantz's and Netanyahu's parties. But Gantz has said he could not agree to a deal that leaves Netanyahu in charge.

During a televised ceremony on Wednesday, Netanyahu said Israelis do not want another election, which will happen if the political stalemate is not broken in the coming weeks.

""If I don't succeed, I will return the mandate to you, and with the help of God and Israel's citizens and yourself, Mr. President, we will establish a broad national unity government down the line,"" he said."

According to a statement from municipal officials, about 250,000 cubic meters of ice are in danger of breaking away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak, which is part of Western Europe's highest mountain range -- the Mont Blanc massif.

“This phenomenon once again testifies that the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,” Stefano Miserocchi, mayor of the town of Courmayeur, said in a statement.

Although scientists have been monitoring the glacier for six years, Miserocchi said the rate of melting has increased significantly recently.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is in New York for the United Nations climate action summit.

“The news that part of Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that should not leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and force us to mobilize,” Conte said, The Guardian reported.

According to BBC News, the entire Mont Blanc massif has 11 peaks of about 4,000 meters in France and Italy, and attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.

Scientists believe that a warming climate is contributing to the melt of glaciers worldwide. In addition, a heatwave across Europe over the summer is said to have influenced melt speed.

Last week, hundreds gathered for a funeral for the Pizol glacier in Switzerland's Glarus Alps. That glacier has lost up to 90 percent of its volume since 2006.

Protesters in Hong Kong have been out on the streets for 16 weeks, resisting what they say is Beijing’s growing control over the semi-autonomous region.

But the latest front in this battle seems to be happening in Hong Kong's business sector.

Some analysts say China is putting pressure on companies in Hong Kong to make their employees toe a pro-China line.

123,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/24/politics/trump-iran-talks-unga/index.html,2019-09-25T09:46:00,Trump issues warnings and extends an olive branch to Iran as allies push for talks,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump brandished a closed fist and extended an olive branch to Iran in remarks at the United Nations Tuesday, threatening more sanctions even as he signaled his willingness to talk.

The comments, part of the President's address to world leaders at the UN's General Assembly, were part of a series of mixed messages on Iran, as French President Emmanuel Macron and other American allies pushed hard for the Trump administration and Iran to engage in dialogue.

""No responsible government should subsidize Iran's blood lust,"" Trump said during his speech to the General Assembly. ""As long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted. They will be tightened."" But he also noted that that many of America's ""greatest friends"" used to be enemies. ""The United States has never believed in permanent enemies,"" Trump told the audience.

Later in the day, Trump told reporters that Iran ""would like to negotiate. We haven't really worked that out. They're here. We're here ... it certainly makes sense, but we haven't agreed to that yet.""

'They're here, we're here'

Trump's hints about potential US-Iran talks and the possibility that Persian Gulf tensions could be diffused were overshadowed by the day's dominating domestic news that the House of Representatives will launch an impeachment inquiry

""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,"" Trump tweeted. ""So bad for our Country!""

Signs of movement on Iran were visible Monday, when Iran had signaled a willingness to talk and key European allies issued a statement ascribing some responsibility to Iran for the attacks on a Saudi oil facility -- a step US officials had urged.

Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed the attack and Iran has denied it played any role, but Trump administration officials have insisted that Tehran bears sole responsibility.

On Tuesday, Trump had told reporters that Iran ""would like to negotiate. We haven't really worked that out. They're here. We're here, but we have not agreed to that yet. They would like to negotiate. And it certainly makes sense.""

Trump's inclination for negotiations and deal making could pose pitfalls when it comes to Iran, said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who warned of the ""yap trap of diplomacy.""

""There's clearly a desire on the part of the President to sit down with Rouhani,"" he said, referring to the Iranian president.

""It wouldn't surprise me if the Iranians try to get a last-minute negotiation,"" Dubowitz said, drawing a comparison to the situation with North Korea. ""They could pull a Kim Jong Un on him, use the diplomacy to undermine the sanctions on the assumption that Trump is unlikely to escalate further if he's talking to Iran.""

When reporters asked Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif earlier in the day if President Hassan Rouhani would meet with Trump on the sidelines of the meeting, the foreign minister shouted, ""No!""

But the day before, Zarif had raised the prospect of a new agreement that would see permanent sanctions relief in exchange for Tehran's permanent denuclearization in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

Behind the scenes, US allies have been working hard to push for some sort of dialogue. Trump acknowledged this, saying that Macron had been speaking to the US about an Iran meeting, as well as Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

'We have the time'

""She's very much involved. We have a lot of people involved. A lot of people would like to get us to the table,"" Trump said.

He added that there's ""a chance"" that Khan could mediate between the US and Iran. Khan ""actually asked me, he thought it would be a good idea to meet and we're here, we're in New York together and we have the time to do it,"" Trump said.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Rouhani for an hour Tuesday, part of an effort to ""achieve de-escalation and stabilization of the situation in the region as well,"" said Masato Otaka, press secretary for Japan's ministry of foreign affairs.

Iranian state media said Rouhani had also held talks with Khan and Macron on Tuesday, and was set to meet with Merkel later in the day. The Iranian leader also met with the UK's Boris Johnson.

Trump wasn't the only one under pressure to enter diplomatic talks.

In a meeting with Johnson and Rouhani, Macron said it would be a ""lost opportunity"" if the Iranian leader left the US without meeting with Trump.

'A lost opportunity'

If Rouhani ""leaves the country, without meeting with President Trump, honestly this is a lost opportunity,"" Macron said to Johnson, while standing next to the Iranian president. ""Because he will not come back in a few months ... and President Trump will not go to Tehran.""

Johnson agreed with Macron, telling Rouhani, ""you need to be on the side of the swimming pool and jump at the same time.""

The most forceful push for talks came from Macron, who used his General Assembly address to call for talks and gently criticize the Trump administration's withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

When the US pulled out, Macron said he predicted that the decision ""could only lead to an increase in tensions in the region unless there was a clear prospect for a diplomatic solution ... Well, what do we have today?"" he asked.

""Iran has responded with a strategy of maximum pressure on its region and environment,"" in response to the US strategy of maximum economic pressure, Macron said. ""The growth in tensions we've seen over the past few months have been constant ... Today, we have a risk of a serious conflict based on a miscalculation or a disproportionate response. Peace is at the mercy of a miscalculation ... and the consequence for the region would be very serious.""

""More than ever, I very sincerely and profoundly believe that the time has come to resume negotiations between the US, Iran, signatories of the JCPOA, and the countries of the region that are first and foremost affected by the security and stability,"" Macron said.

The goals should be to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, to find a solution to the ongoing war in Yemen, to create a regional security plan that addresses ""other crises in the region"" and maritime security, as well as ""a lifting of economic sanctions,"" Macron said.

Rouhani, speaking on Tuesday to a group of American media managers, said Macron's efforts will only be effective if the US lifts the unilateral sanctions it imposed on Iran after leaving the nuclear pact. Those penalties now cover all essential pillars of the economy, including its central bank and sovereign wealth fund.

""It is only at that time that the negotiations within the Group 5+1 will be possible,"" Rouhani said, referring to the group that negotiated the nuclear deal."
124,,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/uaw-and-gm-close-in-on-tentative-deal-to-end-strike.html,2019-09-25T22:27:07,UAW and GM close in on tentative deal to end strike,"DETROIT — The United Auto Workers union and General Motors are closing in on a tentative agreement that could soon end the union's ongoing strike against the automaker.

A deal is not expected to be reached tonight. Negotiators are expected to return to bargaining after a break tonight, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.

Negotiators have been meeting daily since before the work stoppage began on Sept. 16. However, talks between the two sides have intensified in the past 24 to 48 hours, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.

A letter from UAW Vice President Terry Dittes to members on Wednesday confirmed progress has been made this week, as roughly 48,000 union workers picketed outside the automaker's U.S. plants for the 10th day.

Dittes, in the letter, said all unsettled proposals are now at the ""Main Table and have been presented to General Motors and we are awaiting their responses."" He said the ""back and forth will continue until negotiations are complete.""

Having all of the issues at the ""Main Table"" and not in subcommittees is typically a sign that a tentative deal could be imminent as long as the talks don't fall apart over any major sticking points. Depending on how far apart the sides are on the issues, such as pay and temporary workers, that could take hours or days, the sources said.

""We will continue to bargain this contract until your Bargaining Committee is satisfied that we have achieved an Agreement that properly addresses our Members' concerns,"" Dittes said in the letter.

In response to the letter, GM said negotiators ""continue to meet and our goal remains to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our business.""

GM's use of temporary workers and keeping plants open that have been slated for closure have been among the major sticking points, according to people familiar with the talks.

""The intensification of talks to around-the-clock bargaining and at the main table should mean that they're in striking distance of reaching an agreement,"" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. ""But there's still a long way to go once they reach that agreement.""

After a proposed deal is reached, the union has to take the agreement to the GM-UAW council, which includes local union leaders, and then to members to approve. That process typically takes two weeks; however, that could be expedited if the union decides to keep workers on strike during the voting.

Ratification of tentative agreements traditionally hasn't been a problem. However, workers with Fiat Chrysler four years ago rejected the initial deal approved by UAW leaders — which sent negotiators back to the table.

Ahead of the current negotiations, industry analysts cautioned that the ratification of any agreement could be challenging as a federal corruption probe reaches into the UAW's highest ranks.

UAW members with GM have been on strike since Sept. 16 after the two sides failed to reach a deal by a Sept. 14 deadline. It is the union's first national strike against the automaker since a two-day work stoppage in 2007 and the longest national strike since the 1970s."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Samantha Maldonado/AP Samantha Maldonado/AP

Updated at 1:01 p.m. ET

Juul Labs has agreed to stop advertising its popular e-cigarettes in the United States and announced that its chief executive officer is stepping down as state and federal regulators examine hundreds of cases of people who are sick from what appears to be a vaping-related lung disease.

The company also said in a Wednesday statement that it will not push back on a Trump administration plan to pull flavored e-cigarettes from the market until the controversial products win approval from federal regulators.

In the statement, Juul officials said the company will be ""refraining from lobbying the administration on its draft guidance"" that proposes banning fruit-flavored vaping products, unless approved by the Food and Drug Administration, in an attempt to make the e-cigarettes less available to young consumers.

News of the departure of Juul's CEO, Kevin Burns, was accompanied by an announcement that merger discussions have been called off between Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, and Altria, the tobacco giant that owns a 35% stake in Juul.

Burns will be succeeded by K.C. Crosthwaite, the chief growth officer at Altria.

In a statement, Crosthwaite said vaping products originally were introduced to move adult smokers to a safer alternative. But hundreds of cases around the country of mostly young users experiencing a mysterious breathing ailment thought to be tied to vaping is raising new alarms.

He said the company's original mission is at risk ""due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry. Against that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate,"" Crosthwaite said.

Flavored e-cigarettes represent the majority of Juul's sales, but analysts have said the company's decision to stop fighting the Trump administration's regulations might fend off an even bigger blow to the company: the federal government banning Juul from selling any of its products.

At least 530 people in 38 states have been sickened with a vaping-related lung disease, and nine people have died. Health experts are also concerned about long-term pulmonary issues from vaping.

Yet health experts have not tied the outbreak to any specific product or type of e-cigarette. Many cases of the mysterious respiratory illness are connected to people who have used e-cigarette products to vape marijuana bought on the black market.

States including Massachusetts, New York and Michigan have moved to ban the sale of vaping products, and attorneys general in a number of states, including Illinois, are investigating whether Juul violated consumer protection laws by marketing its products to teenagers younger than 18.

Ned Sharpless, the acting FDA commissioner, told a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday that the Trump administration's soon-to-be finalized policy of banning flavored vaping products could change if e-cigarette companies can win federal approval.

""This policy would not mean that flavored e-cigarettes could never be marketed,"" Sharpless said. ""If a company can show through an application to FDA that a specific product meets the standard set forth by Congress, then the FDA would authorize"" the sale of the products, he said.

During the hearing, Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., asked if the surge in vaping-related illnesses represents ""a massive regulatory failure."" Sharpless conceded that the federal government missed some important warning signs.

""In retrospect, the FDA should have acted sooner,"" Sharpless said. ""We should have acted to regulate these devices sooner.""

Data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that the percentage of teenagers who are vaping doubled in the past two years, with about 1 in 4 high school students using e-cigarettes in the past month. That has led the institute's director, Nora Volkow, to declare vaping ""a public health crisis.""

""These products introduce the highly addictive chemical nicotine to these young people and their developing brains, and I fear we are only beginning to learn the possible health risks and outcomes for youth,"" Volkow said.

The FDA is set to release its policy restricting the sale of flavored vaping products in the coming weeks.

For its part, Juul has taken steps to combat the selling of its products to minors, including requiring some retail stores to electronically verify government-issued ID before allowing someone to buy its products.

But critics of Juul have accused the company of deliberately targeting young people by marketing flavors including mango, cucumber and mint.

The FDA's office of criminal investigations is currently probing products that are reportedly making people ill.

""FDA is not pursuing any actions associated with personal use of any vaping products, our interest is in the suppliers,"" Sharpless told Congress on Wednesday. ""But to be clear, if we determine that someone is manufacturing or distributing illicit, adulterated vaping products that caused illness and death for personal profit, we would consider that to be a criminal act."""

127,,https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/everything-amazon-announced-at-its-alexa-event-today/,2019-09-26T01:59:19,Everything Amazon announced at its Alexa event today – TechCrunch,"As is now typical just ahead of the holidays, Amazon just inundated us with a whole new lineup of hardware devices, including new Echo smart speakers and screens, at its Alexa event today, plus other smart home and connected devices from its brands Ring and Eero. There were also a slew of surprises, like Alexa earbuds, glasses, and a smart ring. And oh yeah, a new Alexa-powered oven, too.

New Echos

Headlining the event are Amazon’s latest updates to its Echo line of devices.

Echo Dot with Clock

Not one for overly creative names, Amazon has given its entry-level Echo, the Echo Dot, a nifty upgrade. The new Echo Dot with Clock now features a digital alarm clock on the front, which can be dimmed if you prefer, at times. This LED display also allows the Dot to show the weather, when asked, or a countdown timer.

The new Dot doesn’t replace the original, however. It’s just a $10 upgrade to $59 if you want the extra feature.

Echo Studio

The Echo the audiophiles have been waiting for. The new Echo Studio is Amazon’s response to Google’s Nest Max and Apple’s HomePod. The $199.99 device supports 3D audio and Dolby Atmos. It has five drivers, including one downward-facing 5.25-inch woofer, a 1-inch, front-firing tweeter and three, 2-inch, mid-range speakers aimed at different directions.

And it has a 24-bit DAC and a power amplifier with 100 kHz of bandwidth for high-res, lossless music playback — you know, like what’s available through the Amazon Music HD service.

Echo Buds

Surprise, Alexa comes to your ear through Amazon’s own $129 wireless earbuds. The Echo Buds include Bose’s Active Noise Reduction Technology and provide hands-free access to Alexa, so you can do things like play music, get directions, order an Uber and more. Later, you’ll also be able to check Whole Foods inventory as you shop, too. (For those who still shop…in an actual store).

The Echo Buds offer 5 hours of music or 4 hours of call time and come with a case that holds up to 3 charges. And with a tap, the Echo Buds can access your phone’s other assistant, like Siri or Google Assistant.

Echo Show 8

The $129 Echo Show 8 is a smaller, 8-inch version of the 10-inch flagship model of the Echo device with a screen. It’s a little bigger than the Echo 5, which is more of an alarm clock alternative, so makes sense for watching videos and placing voice calls…or dropping in on the kids. The device features an HD display and built-in camera shutter.

Echo

The company refreshed its existing Echo speaker with better sound and new colorful fabric covers (Twilight Blue, Charcoal, Heather Grey, and Sandstone), but remains the same price as before at $99. In other words, there’s no need to run out and buy this Echo to replace your old one, but if you were in the market already, the Echo you’ll get is slightly better.

Echo Glow

This fun Alexa accessory is basically a nightlight for the kids that can change color and flash to the music. But at $30, it’s a lot of cash for a little bit of fun. Let’s wait for the inevitable Kids Edition Dot + Glow bundle, shall we?

Echo Flex

You can now bring Echo to the bathroom with the new $25 Echo Flex device. (No really, this is how Amazon had it set up in its demo area.) The Flex plugs into any available outlet and functions as a small smart speaker. There’s no camera (whew) but it can respond to voice commands, like to give you the news and weather while you get ready for work, for example. It can also be upgraded with $14 accessories, including a Smart Night Light or Motion Sensor. The Flex is $25.



Echo Frames & Loop

Amazon introduced its beta, invite-only hardware devices. One is a pair of $179.99 Alexa-enabled glasses that stick 4 micro speakers in the frame for hands-free Alexa.

The other is a $129.99 Alexa-enabled smart ring with 2 microphones that puts Alexa on your finger for quick questions or brief calls.

Other Hardware

New Eero mesh Wi-Fi router

Amazon launched the next generation of its Eero router, which now works better with Alexa. The router lets you do things like shut off or pause the Wi-Fi with voice commands — features that will later come to other routers from TP-Link, Asus, Linsky, and Arris by way of an API. The router is $99, or available in a three-pack for $249, and is available in the U.S. today and in Europe later this year.

Amazon Smart Oven

What’s an Amazon event without a new Alexa-powered oven, right? This time around, Amazon takes on the June Oven with a $250 combination convection oven, microwave, air fryer, and food warmer. Once paired with Echo, you can ask Alexa to do things like preheat the oven, start or stop the cooking, and more.

New Ring Cams

The Ring Stick Up Cam got a price drop to $99 as the Ring Stick Up Cam Elite, $199, launches. Unlike the Stick Up Cam, the new camera will be powered over Ethernet. The Ring Indoor Cam is a wired-only cheaper version of the camera at $60.

More Stuff

Alexa gets Smarter and Weirder

Amazon also took the time to mention a few upgrades to Alexa’s capabilities today.

This includes a multilingual mode where Alexa will be able to now speak both English and Spanish in the U.S.; French and English in Canada; and Hindi and English in India.

A new Neural Text to Speech model which will use machine learning to help Alexa be more “expressive.”

Celebrity voices! Because who doesn’t want Alexa to sound like Samuel L. Jackson? No really. The Jackson voice will be a 99-cent add-on to Echo devices and more celeb additions are in the works.

Alexa is coming to GM, including 2018 and newer Cadillac, Chevy, Buic and GMC vehicles

Scan-to-Cook is an upgrade for Echo Show which lets you scan a barcode to have the new Amazon Smart Oven prepare the item correct. The feature works with hundreds of Whole Foods brands, like 365 Everyday Value, plus Gardein, Marie Callender’s and more.

Certified for Humans is a new program that will highlight easy-to-use smart home products to consumers searching Amazon. Easy is just one requirement, though. The other is “works with Alexa.”

Alexa Guard gets updated to listen for more than just breaking glass, smoke or carbon monoxide alarms. Now it will listen for human activity too — like if footsteps, talking, coughing, or a door closing, is detected while Guard is in Away mode.

Alexa replenishment service, launching later this year, will alert you when supplies from smart home devices are low — like batteries that need changing in a smart lock, or an air filter that’s ready for a swap.

New utterances: You’ll be able to ask Alexa, “tell me what you heard” and “why did you do that?”

Alexa-powered Food Network Kitchen Service

Customers love Alexa in the kitchen for watching recipe videos. So Amazon doubled down on this with its partner, Food Network, to offer both live and on-demand cooking classes for Echo Show users. The service launches in October, and while Alexa is the exclusive voice partner, it will also be offered on phones and tablets. Oh, and Bobby Flay is involved.

Amazon Sidewalk

One of the more interesting introductions today was Amazon Sidewalk, Amazon’s low-bandwidth, long-distance wireless protocol designed to connect all of the IoT devices around your home and beyond — including places where Bluetooth or Wi-Fi can’t reach. The network uses the free, over-the-air 900 megahertz spectrum, and could allow for things like an Alexa-connected mailbox or lights for the yard, for example.

Ring Fetch

The first product to take advantage of Amazon Sidewalk was a connected dog tag that will alert you when your pooch exits a geofence you’ve established — like the yard. The Ring Fetch launches next year."
128,,https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning,2019-09-25T23:23:31,Apple’s iPhone 11 and 11 Pro will show a warning on your lock screen if they can’t verify a replaced screen,"Apple has published a new support document that says the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max will present customers with a warning if the devices are unable to verify a genuine display after a screen repair job. “If you need to replace your iPhone display, it’s important for certified technicians who use genuine Apple display parts to repair it,” the page reads. “Replacements not performed by Apple, authorized service providers, or certified technicians might not follow proper safety and repair procedures and could result in improper function or issues with display quality or safety.”

Apple goes over a laundry list of problems that could arise if your display is swapped the wrong way or with a non-genuine part, such as multi-touch problems, issues with screen color accuracy and brightness, or True Tone failing to work properly. “Additionally, repairs that don’t properly replace screws or cowlings might leave behind loose parts that could damage the battery, cause overheating, or result in injury.”

The company isn’t afraid of nagging customers about this, either. Apple says that a notification will appear on the affected iPhone’s lock screen for 4 days after a problem is first detected, then it’ll move to the main settings menu for 15 more days. After all that, it gets pushed away to Settings -> General -> About.

According to Apple, this new measure only applies to its brand new iPhones and not previous models. Even if it can’t be verified as genuine, the display isn’t prevented from functioning normally by iOS.

This new screen verification warning follows another alert that Apple recently began showing customers when iPhones detect an unauthorized battery replacement. “We take the safety of our customers very seriously and want to make sure any battery replacement is done properly,” an Apple spokesperson said about that notification, which was criticized by right to repair advocates because it also disables the iPhone’s battery statistics and health data. “There are now over 1,800 Apple authorized service providers across the US so our customers have even more convenient access to quality repairs.” Apple recently said it would make genuine parts available to more independent repair businesses.

Raising a safety issue with batteries is perfectly reasonable; batteries can be dangerous. But should the company be this aggressive about swapped displays? On the other hand, this is a pretty direct way of alerting customers that they might’ve been given a bum display by their local repair shop. And if you’re buying a used iPhone 11 at some point in the future, there’ll be no wondering whether the screen was replaced with a cheap, non-Apple part.

However, there’s an added element to this display notification that seems a little alarming, too. Apple makes it sound as if the iPhone might report back to the company that you’re using a display that couldn’t be verified and tie that information to the device’s service history. This could potentially cause problems if you need to get something else on your iPhone fixed down the line.

You might see an additional notification that says, “Apple has updated the device information for this iPhone.” This means that Apple has updated the device information maintained for your iPhone for service needs, safety analysis, and to improve future products.

The Verge has reached out to Apple for more details on these new display verification measures. The company recently introduced a subscription model for its AppleCare+ extended warranty, letting customers pay monthly even beyond the usual two-year window and maintain coverage for as long as Apple offers servicing for that device."

They also announced that their next generation of 3D NAND flash memory will use 144 layers and come to market first with QLC-based SSDs, to be followed later by TLC-based SSDs.

It appears that the new Optane products are still using first-generation 3D XPoint memory, though Intel is not confirming that at this time. The Intel-Micron partnership that produced 3D XPoint memory and many generations of NAND flash memory is now ended, but Intel has not announced any plans for high-volume manufacturing of 3D XPoint outside of the IMFT fab in Utah that Micron is keeping in the divorce. Intel is bringing up a ""technology development line"" for 3D XPoint at a facility in Rio Rancho, NM, but so far this is only being discussed as an R&D location, not a large-scale manufacturing center. Last we heard, the long-term plan was to move 3D XPoint manufacturing to China.

Intel's Optane DC Persistent Memory that attaches directly to the memory controllers of server CPUs using the DIMM form factor was a bit late in coming to market, arriving with the current Cascade Lake-SP generation instead of with Skylake-SP as originally planned. Those first-generation Optane DCPM modules are also known under the codename Apache Pass. Their successor will be the Barlow Pass modules, planned to coincide with Cooper Lake (14nm) and Ice Lake (10nm) server processors scheduled for 2020. Furthermore, Intel's roadmap extends out for at least two more generations of unnamed DCPM modules to be paired with Sapphire Rapids processors and their successor(s), respectively. Based on previous Intel statements, Sapphire Rapids and third-generation Optane DCPM modules should be using a DDR5 interface. In the more immediate future, the current Apache Pass Optane DCPM modules will soon be arriving in the high-end workstation market alongside Cascade Lake. In the long run, Intel is working with Microsoft to lay the groundwork for persistent memory support in client editions of Windows, but Intel isn't ready to make specific promises about bringing persistent memory support to their consumer hardware platforms.

Optane ""Alder Stream"" SSD compared to Optane DC P4800X and SSD DC P4610

On the NVMe SSD side, Intel will be inaugurating the second generation of enterprise Optane SSDs in 2020. The original Optane SSD DC P4800X (codenamed Coldstream) will be replaced by Alder Stream next year. Intel is promising major performance improvements but is being coy about just how big a jump we can expect; they provided a graph that cuts off the end of the curve for Alder Stream but indicates it should at least get close to doubling random IO performance. (Intel's graph is for 70/30 mixed 4kB random IO.) It wouldn't be a surprise to see PCIe 4.0 support given the lifespan Intel's new Optane SSD controller can be expected to have, but the performance data Intel has shared so far doesn't require more than the current generation's PCIe 3 x4 interface. After Alder Stream it is reasonable to expect enthusiast derivatives to replace the Optane SSD 900P and 905P, and eventually a replacement for the dual-port Optane SSD DC D4800X, but Intel hasn't made mention of these yet.

Notably missing from Intel's presentation is anything new for consumers based on Optane. They are still touting the Optane Memory H10 two-in-one SSD, but the second-generation consumer Optane M.2 drives (Optane Memory M15 and Optane SSD 815P) have been officially cancelled. The 815P is dead because 118GB is simply too small for a standalone SSD to be competitive, and the M15 is dead because there aren't enough systems still shipping with mechanical hard drives to support another generation of cache drives. The current Optane Memory M10 and Optane SSD 800P are not being discontinued yet.

3D NAND Developments

As for flash-based SSDs, Intel's presentation focused primarily on QLC NAND. Intel's SSD 660p is the most successful consumer QLC drive to date, and it will soon be replaced by a 665p that switches to 96-layer QLC from the current 64-layer QLC NAND. This isn't a full product announcement with specs or an exact release date, but we predict it will not bring major performance changes and will arrive by the end of the year.

Intel's next generation of 3D NAND after 96 layers will be 144 layers. This will be a QLC-first generation, keeping the same 1Tb die capacity as their 96 and 64-layer QLC. Intel is still committed to their 3D floating gate memory cell design, which they claim provides superior data retention to the charge trap flash designs used by most of their competitors. Intel has not stated whether they are taking their string stacking construction beyond two decks, but it seems most likely that they are reaching 144 layers with something like a 72+72 layer design rather than 48+48+48.

Intel has followed in the footsteps of some of their competitors by bringing up the subject of 5 bit per cell NAND flash to push density beyond QLC (4 bit per cell) NAND flash. Their report is similar to what Toshiba said at Flash Memory Summit: they have it working in the lab, but have not determined if it is feasible for real products.

Intel's next round of enterprise/datacenter flash-based SSDs will be arriving in 2020, including a 144L QLC SSD. We don't have any model numbers yet, just codenames. Arbordale+ is tricky to speculate about since the original Arbordale codename was only used internally and didn't result in any shipping products, so all we know is that it will be a 144L QLC product. Cliffdale-R will be the 96L TLC refresh of the current Cliffdale SSD DC P46xx/45xx family. This probably means that 144L TLC enterprise SSDs won't be arriving in 2020 and their 144L node will be QLC-only for quite a while. Cliffdale-R should be the first SSDs under Intel's new naming scheme to occupy the SSD D7 tier.

A top Disney source says Kennedy remains in charge with no plans for any changes. One knowledgeable source says Feige has told a major actor that there’s a specific role he would like that person to play if and when he makes the movie.

However, with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker set to hit theaters Dec. 20, it is understandable that Disney would like to keep as much about the future of the franchise under wraps as possible. Skywalker, otherwise known as Episode IX, is meant to be the final installment of the series that was first launched by George Lucas in 1977. It is also meant to win back fans after the last sequel trilogy entry, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, divided audiences, even though reviews were largely positive and the film grossed $1.3 billion worldwide.

Under Feige’s leadership, Marvel has had an extraordinary run of hits, including four of the top 10 movies ever released. This summer, Avengers: Endgame grossed $2.9 billion and surpassed Avatar to become the top grosser of all time, not adjusted for inflation. Feige has a packed slate of Marvel movies and TV in the works, and he is expected to take a big role in developing the Marvel heroes, like the X-Men, that Disney got in the Fox acquisition.

Kennedy has been president of Lucasfilm since 2012. She is one of the very few women in top executive jobs at Disney, but she was picked for the job by Lucas before he sold his company for $4 billion that year. In September 2018, she renewed her contract for three years.

So far, the four Star Wars films produced for Disney have grossed almost $4.5 billion. But while Feige has presided over a mostly seamless rollout of one Marvel hit after another, reinvigorating the Star Wars franchise has not been a smooth process. Gareth Edwards was effectively sidelined as the helmer of the troubled 2016 film Rogue One, with Tony Gilroy shooting the third act. The film went on to become a hit, generating strong reviews and $1.1 billion worldwide.

In June 2017, Kennedy fired directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller during the production of the prequel film Solo amid concerns about their improvisational style. Ron Howard stepped in to finish the film, which grossed $392.9 million and became the first Star Wars pic to lose money. In September 2017, Jurassic World filmmaker Colin Trevorrow was dropped as director of Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker and replaced by J.J. Abrams, who successfully relaunched the franchise in 2015 with The Force Awakens. Disney chairman Bob Iger conceded in a recent New York Times interview that the studio had made mistakes. “I just think that we might’ve put a little bit too much in the marketplace too fast,” he said.

One potential trouble sign for Lucasfilm and Disney is the allegedly disappointing attendance at new Star Wars attractions in Anaheim and Orlando. During a recent earnings call, Iger said interest in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was still high, and “long term … we have no concerns whatsoever about them."" (On Wednesday, Disney unveiled a new leadership structure for the Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort parks in Anaheim and Orlando.)

Disney has been criticized for its lack of women in top roles at the company, so any move to displace Kennedy may create perception problems. In his Times interview, Iger acknowledged that women and people of color were not well-represented but said, ""I’ll change that before I leave.""

While Disney and Lucasfilm have scaled back development of Star Wars movies in part due to the poor performance of Solo, it is still working on future movies. Both Last Jedi helmer Rian Johnson and Game of Thrones showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff are working on feature projects set in the Star Wars universe. And with Disney ramping up its streaming service Disney+, Lucasfilm will be an important piece of the puzzle. Jon Favreau’s live-action Star Wars space Western, The Mandalorian, is set to premiere Nov. 12, and a Rogue One prequel series is in the works, as is an Ewan McGregor-led Obi-Wan Kenobi series."

A day after the singer-turned-fashion designer revealed she dropped 100 pounds since welcoming her third child, Simpson stepped out for a ladies' night on Wednesday!

The 39-year-old star kicked off her evening taking to Instagram to post a sexy photo of herself in a little black dress. Simpson paired the LBD with black pantyhose, black heels and a matching purse. Her blonde locks were straight and parted down the side and she rocked a smoky eye.

""NYC Ladies’ Night ✨,"" Simpson captioned her post, which quickly was filled with people praising her sophisticated and seductive look.

Cameras also captured the former ""With You"" singer stepping out of her hotel room.

On Tuesday, Simpson shared how during her pregnancy with daughter Birdie she reached a weight of 240, and was ""so proud"" to have dropped 100 pounds.

""6 months. 100 pounds down (Yes, I tipped the scales at 240 😜),” she wrote on social media. ""My first trip away from #BIRDIEMAE and emotional for many reasons, but so proud to feel like myself again. Even when it felt impossible, I chose to work harder. 💚.""

A source told ET that Simpson has been working out, walking and eating healthy in order to get back in shape.

Simpson and her husband, Eric Johnson, are also parents to Ace, 6, and Maxwell, 7. During her pregnancy with Birdie, she opened up about her struggles, including ankle swelling, anxiety and morning sickness.

""After a month of sciatica pain, followed by 3 weeks of Bronchitis, I figured since my feet fit in my sneaks today I needed to walk out a lot of anxiety!!"" she wrote in February. She also shared a photo of her severely swollen feet, asking her fans for any remedies. Thankfully, the swelling went down after she tried cupping.

West later confirmed the cryptic tweet with a post on his own website. Jesus Is King was expected to be heavily gospel-influenced, following West’s touring Sunday Service performances and its extremely Biblical tracklist. However, according to sources close to the situation, it will no longer be released this Friday. It’s unclear what will happen to the project next.

Jesus Is King is the second project from West to face a last-minute shelving in less than a year. Yandhi — which was also announced by his wife on Twitter — was expected to be released last September, before being pushed back to a November 23rd release date. It never arrived. West eventually addressed the situation personally, tweeting, “I realize the new album I’ve been working on isn’t ready yet. I’ll announce the release date once it’s done. Thank you for understanding.” Jesus Is King has been understood to be a completely new project after unofficial versions of songs presumably intended for Yandhi leaked online earlier this year.

According to reports, the decision to delay Jesus Is King happened concurrently with a meeting West had with executives from his label, Def Jam, in Wyoming. On Sunday, West held one of his signature, Christianity-themed Sunday Services near Cody, Wyoming, where he recently purchased a ranch."

Their goal: work the Fantasy football waiver wire and create the right lineup combinations to survive the meat of the 2019 NFL schedule. With a number of marquee games taking place in Week 4, finding matchups to exploit is key to coming away with a win. The red-hot Kansas City Chiefs have another juicy matchup against the Detroit Lions in a game whose total is 54 this week. If you're a Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce or Sammy Watkins owner, they've probably already worked their way into automatic-start territory. But for more difficult start or sit decisions, you need to see the Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. They'll help you make optimal Fantasy football picks for Week 4 and beyond.

When it comes to ranking players, their model beat human experts in Fantasy football last season when there were big differences in ranking. And the model was closest to the hole overall, meaning it best pinpointed where every player would finish each week. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.

Last week, the model was extremely high on Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston, saying he'd finish as a top-five player at his position despite being started in less than 50 percent of leagues. The result: Winston threw for 380 yards and three touchdowns against the Giants, finishing as the overall QB5. Anybody who had him in their lineup was well on their way to a huge week.

Now the model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, has revealed its 2019 Fantasy football rankings for Week 4 of the NFL season. One player the model is high on this week: Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman. After receiving just one target in his debut, the rookie has taken on a larger role in Kansas City's offense in the two weeks since Hill was shut down.

Hardman has received 11 total targets the last two weeks and hauled in six passes for 158 yards and two touchdowns. With 4.33-second speed in the 40-yard-dash, he might not be as nuanced a receiver as Hill, but he does give the Chiefs a vertical element they're looking for. With Mahomes attacking downfield relentlessly, the value in that is inherent. That's why SportsLine's Week 4 Fantasy football rankings list Hardman as the No. 18 wide receiver, a rock-solid WR2, even though he's being started in just 18 percent of CBS Sports leagues and still available in 40 percent.

And a massive shocker: Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen, who's recorded a touchdown catch in two of his first three games, stumbles big-time and doesn't even crack the top 25.

Thielen put up solid numbers in Minnesota's victory against the Raiders on Sunday, finishing with three receptions for 55 yards and a touchdown and adding a one-yard rushing score. However, Thielen and the Vikings must travel Soldier Field this week to face the Bears, who feature an extremely disruptive defense that is giving up just 13 points per game.

Plus, Thielen has struggled mightily against Chicago in recent years, failing to score a touchdown while recording fewer than 70 yards receiving in his last six meetings against the Bears. He's a player to consider putting on the bench in Week 4 and is squarely out of the WR1 conversation.

The model is also calling for a surprising quarterback you aren't even thinking about to finish in the top 10 of its Week 4 Fantasy football rankings. This player could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

So who should you sit and start this week? And which surprising quarterback could lead you to victory? Visit SportsLine now to get Week 4 Fantasy football rankings for every position, plus see which QB is going to come out of nowhere to crack the top 10, all from the model that out-performed experts big time last season."

Their defense, led by defensive genius Vic Fangio, has been rightfully ridiculed for not forcing a sack or turnover this season. The Broncos are, somehow, the first team to accomplish that feat. It’s also worth noting that the great Von Miller — who also doesn’t have a single quarterback hit in 94.9 percent of the defensive snaps — has been missing in action, too.

Let’s, however, put the defense on the back burner because it still hasn’t played poorly and hasn’t been the primary reason the Broncos have lost.

Scroll to continue with content Ad

No. That would be the offense, which complements a strong run game led by one of my favorite running backs (the hard-charging Phillip Lindsay) with one of the league’s least-impressive passing games.

(Yahoo Sports)

I know, I know. With Joe Flacco at the helm, big shock. But one of the first Things I Noticed while reviewing an interesting spate of Week 3 games were the Broncos’ passing issues, which will be amplified this Sunday against a jacked-up Jacksonville Jaguars defense that’s coming off a killer performance in a 20-7 Thursday night win over Tennessee.

Quarterback Joe Flacco took it on chin against a nasty Packers defense in Week 3. More pain might be in the forecast as the Broncos next face the Jaguars. (Getty Images)

As I detailed in the video above — produced by my main man Ron Schiltz — the Broncos have reason to fear the Jaguars’ D, which was downright menacing against the Titans, racking up an insane nine sacks and 13 quarterback hits against a far-too-passive Marcus Mariota.

The effort was led by stud Calais Campbell, who notched three sacks and five quarterback hits in the single-best performance by a defensive lineman this year. That’s something considering the way Green Bay’s Preston Smith (the NFC Defensive Player of the Week) has been playing.

Story continues

And considering the way Smith and the Packers terrorized Broncos right tackle Elijah Wilkinson and his fellow O-linemen this past week, it’s hard to see Denver blocking a front led by Campbell — a Denver native who is already talking about looking forward to his second pro game in the Mile High City — especially if Flacco doesn’t stop holding onto the ball.

[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here’s how.]

“There was definitely a few of those where he held onto it for a long time,” Fangio said after the Broncos’ most recent loss. “There’s only so much time you can hold it back there, and Joe’s got to do a better job of getting it out quicker.”

So yes, Flacco better heed Fangio’s words and Denver better jump out to an early lead against Jacksonville. Otherwise, the Jaguars’ fearsome D-line could tee off on an overmatched front (and QB) that has surrendered the sixth-most sacks in the league (11).

2. The heir to Cam’s throne?

Let’s hear it for the Carolina Panthers! Now this is the team we thought could contend for the NFC South title.

Granted, they beat the fledgling Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. But their 38-20 win was a complete performance, one led by a speedy defense that did an outstanding job corralling the elusive Kyler Murray (eight sacks) and a superb performance by backup quarterback Kyle Allen, who completed 19 of 26 passes for 261 yards and four touchdowns.

Allen was more than “functional” in place of Cam Newton on Sunday. He was decisive, he threw in rhythm and he made some downright killer, big-boy throws.

Check these out, folks:

Allen was making throws on the move, off his back foot, in tight coverage … and I’m just saying, if he continues to make throws like this over the coming weeks, and the Panthers keep winning, there are going to be calls to keep him in the mix even when Newton heals from a mid-foot sprain, especially because Allen apparently doesn’t lack cool or confidence.

“He’s real confident in who he is as a football player,” Carolina coach Ron Rivera said recently. “He’s got a lot of swag, which is kind of interesting when you watch him, and he’s been able to back that up. He did it in high school, he did it in college, and the two times he’s played for us, he’s played pretty well.”

We’ll see if he can keep it going this weekend against the Texans, who rank 23rd in pass defense and have notched only one interception through three games.

3. Carson Wentz’s kryptonite?

One of Matt Patricia’s favorite ways to frustrate an offense as head coach of the Detroit Lions is to rush just three men and drop eight into coverage. It’s something the New England Patriots, where he was defensive coordinator from 2012-2017, liked to do in recent years, and Patricia has continued that trend.

It was noticeable late in the Lions’ surprising 27-24 win over the Philadelphia Eagles when the Lions, who led by three, dropped eight men into coverage with successful results, as quarterback Carson Wentz went 1-for-4 for 5 yards and a 6-yard fourth-down scramble that fell 2 yards short of the marker.

Patricia loves to drop eight, especially when the goal is to take away the deep routes, play bend-but-don’t break and allow the clock to run. It will be fascinating to see if he tries it in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes, who I’m convinced could regularly complete passes against 12-man defenses, let alone 11.

Furthermore, I’ll be keeping an eye on whether Wentz faces more three-man rushes on Thursday night against an aggressive Green Bay defense that rushed two or three at a 13.5 percent clip in 2018 — the fifth-most in the league — under Mike Pettine.

4. Play this fearless tight end in fantasy this week

Another revelation in 2019 has been Seattle tight end Will Dissly, who has been killing it to such a degree that the Seahawks traded tight end Nick Vannett — a third-round pick in 2016 who is coming off a career season — to the tight end-needy Steelers for a 2020 fifth-round pick.

Dissly, a fourth-round pick a year ago, has caught 12 of 14 targets for 124 yards this year, and he does his best work in the red zone, where he can use his size (6-foot-4, 265 pounds), toughness and feel for finding open space to win in close quarters. It’s no coincidence that all three of his touchdowns this year have come in the red area. His fearlessness when he knows he’s gonna take a lick stands out. Here are five plays that show that:

Don’t bet on Dissly’s strong run ending anytime soon. Seattle’s next opponent is Arizona, which has gotten pillaged by tight ends in all three games it has played this season as Carolina’s Greg Olsen (six catches, 75 yards, two touchdowns), Detroit’s rookie T.J. Hockenson (six catches, 131 yards and touchdown) and Baltimore's Mark Andrews (eight catches, 112 yards, one touchdown) all found room to roam.

After three years in a Chinese prison for allegedly assaulting a man during a bar fight, Brown returned home Wednesday to the hugs and smiling faces of his loved ones, the AP reports. Outside of his family's brick house on Detroit's east side, he took a few moments to reflect on regaining his freedom. ""We don't really understand that word to its fullest extent until (we're) without it,"" Brown said. ""Hallelujah! I'm free!"" Brown, 32, was hesitant Wednesday to discuss the Chongqing bar incident, which he referred to as a ""minor altercation,"" or his treatment in prison. ""I'm just very fortunate that it's over,"" he said, adding that he will soon head to Florida to see his 12-year-old son.

Brown, who played at Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Detroit and Ball State University in Indiana, was teaching English and coaching American football in southwestern China when he was arrested in September 2016 and charged with intentional assault. Brown, who was the only person prosecuted over the incident, denied hitting the man and said he was defending himself after being attacked. And witnesses said Brown was being harassed by other patrons. However, the court ruled that he ""didn't do enough to de-escalate the situation,"" according to the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco-based rights monitoring group. Brown was sentenced to four years in prison, but a Chinese court later reduced it to three years, saying that was due to apologies and expressions of forgiveness between Brown and others involved in the fight, as well as Brown's payment of $28,750 in compensation.

Now, in Week 4 of the 2019 NFL season, Johnson will be on the 53-man roster against the Buffalo Bills. Here are four things to know about the rookie fullback.

His path to the NFL was an unconventional one.

Johnson was born in Stuttgart, Germany, which is where he began his football career as a member of the Stuttgart Scorpions’ U19 team. Johnson proved to be both too skilled and too physically overpowering for U19 German football, so he moved to Jacksonville, Florida’s Jean Ribault High School for his senior year of high school to chase an opportunity playing football in the United States.

There Johnson impressed enough to earn Division 1 scholarship offers from schools like the University of Wisconsin and the University of Central Florida, but he eventually accepted a scholarship from the University of Tennessee. Johnson graduated from Tennessee in 2018 with three career receptions for 23 yards as well as 24 career tackles, and after failing to be drafted, made his way back to Stuttgart to continue playing for his hometown team, now at the professional level.

With an NFL future seeming nearly impossible for Johnson, he was given one last opportunity via the NFL’s International Player Pathway Program, an initiative created by the NFL in 2017 to give international players a more viable path to making NFL rosters. Johnson was one of seven players selected to participate in the initial three-month training camp at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. He was then selected to be one of the four players chosen to be added to a roster via the International Player Pathway Program.

He made a position change.

If you watched Johnson’s highlights from his time with the U19 Scorpions team, you’d notice that they weren’t at fullback, but rather at linebacker. Johnson was originally recruited to the University of Tennessee to play linebacker, but after his freshman season, the Volunteers coaching staff decided to move Johnson to tight end. After the position change, Johnson was used primarily on special teams and as a blocking tight end.

Once he moved back to Stuttgart in 2018, Johnson had a prolific season in the German Football League, recording 43 catches for 474 yards and four touchdowns. He then made one last position change to fullback for the International Player Pathway Program.

The move seems to have paid off as Johnson has carved out a spot on the 53-man roster, only the second player from the program to do so, the first being 2018’s Efe Obada, who currently plays defensive end for the Carolina Panthers.

Bill Belichick didn’t want him.

Johnson ended up on the Patriots not because head coach Belichick thought that Johnson was a dynamic prospect, but because the AFC East won a random draw to be the division awarded the International Pathway players. Belichick even admitted in a media conference call that he didn’t particularly want Johnson.

“He was not on our radar,” Belichick said of Johnson. “I don’t think we ever would have ever signed him. When the [international] players were listed, there were a group of players that fell into this category, and we looked at that group. It was kind of like, ‘Is there anybody here you want?’

Belichick had his choice of a four-person group that included two former rugby players, Australian Valentine Holmes and Englishman Christian Wade, Brazilian defensive tackle Durval Queiroz Neto, and Johnson.

Belichick decided he wanted Johnson in part because of a phone call he had with his old coach from the University of Tennessee, Butch Jones.

“Based on some research and follow-up at Tennessee, Butch [Jones] recommended him to me. We didn’t really know much about the other guys, and I can’t say that we were excited to have him. But based on what Butch said, it felt like he was a good player to work with, would work hard, would really try to get better, was a good teammate and all those things that he had showed at Tennessee.”

It was Johnson’s continued progress over training camp that moved him from as Belichick put it “the 91st player on the roster,” to a practice squad player, and now to a member of the full 53-man roster.

“I don’t think anybody ever envisioned him being on the roster at that point, or even being on the practice squad, to tell you the truth. But he continued to get better and certainly his physicality and his toughness showed up in the preseason games and the preseason practices.”

He’s an accomplished student.

A gifted athlete, Johnson is also extremely gifted off the football field as well. While at Tennessee, Johnson was studying to go to med school. He graduated with a degree in kinesiology, and was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for three consecutive seasons.

“When I was at UT, I had a lot of plans,” Johnson said to the Boston Herald. “I wanted to go to med school after football was over. I was in a bunch of really hard classes and now that I don’t have classes to worry about I take all that energy and try to focus it toward really being prepared and studying the plays.”

When asked if he had any interest in med school now that he’s a member of the Patriots, Johnson said, “For me right now it’s football, a hundred percent. I told myself that if I was going to get this opportunity that I would come away just knowing football inside and out, knowing everything there is to know about it, so that’s just what I’m trying to do.”"

The first ever image of a black hole, obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, is one of the most incredible scientific achievements of the past decade. The blurry orange ring snapped from across the universe took an incredible amount of data and smarts to produce. It makes me feel infinitely small in an infinitely fascinating universe.

But I have to level with you. As awe-inspiring and terrifying as it is, it's not all that much to look at. NASA's new visualization, on the other hand, is mesmerizing.

The impressive visualization, created by Jeremy Schnittman using a custom software at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, is reminiscent of Interstellar's Gargantua black hole crossed with the EHTs image and demonstrates how the galactic gravity sinks influence the spacetime surrounding them.

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/Jeremy Schnittman

Black holes are extremely dense regions of space with huge gravitational pull. It's so powerful not even light can escape from it. Gas, dust and debris that get pulled in by its gravity swing around the hole as if trapped in an insanely-fast, incredibly-hot carousel. The carousel, a bright halo of matter known as the accretion disk, is the visible portion of a black hole. Depending on what angle we see it from, our image can be dramatically skewed.

NASA's visualization has us seeing the disk edge-on, so the light at the top of the image is actually from behind the black hole. Viewing the cosmic beast at this angle, we also see matter is much brighter on the left-hand side than the right because it's moving toward us, the viewer. A cosmic phenomenon known as ""Doppler beaming"" increases the level of brightness for light moving in such a way, and the opposite is true as it moves away from us.

NASA is celebrating black holes for Black Hole Week and on Tuesday released a cutesy safety video demonstrating how to deal with the ever-mysterious monsters."

Researchers carried out the first systematic review of existing research into AI in the health sector and published their findings in The Lancet Digital Health journal.

It focused on an AI technique called deep learning, which employs algorithms, big data, and computing power to emulate human intelligence.

This allows computers to identify patterns of disease by examining thousands of images, before applying what they learn to new individual cases to provide a diagnosis. Excitement is building around the technology, and the US Food and Drug Administration has already approved a number of AI algorithms for use in healthcare.

AI has been hailed as a way to reduce the workload for overstretched medical professionals and revolutionize healthcare, but so far scientific research has failed to live up to the hype.

A Japanese H-2B rocket fired into orbit Tuesday from the Tanegashima Space Center with an automated cargo freighter loaded with more than 4.1 tons of batteries, experiments, spacewalk equipment, water and provisions for the International Space Station.

The unpiloted cargo ship lifted off at 1605:05 GMT (12:05:05 p.m. EDT) Tuesday from Launch Pad No. 2 at Tanegashima, an oceanfront spaceport on an island in southern Japan.

The 186-foot-tall (56.6-meter) H-2B rocket proceeded through an apparently trouble-free countdown Tuesday. After filling the rocket with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants, the H-2B launch team managed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gave approval to proceed with final launch preps, culminating in ignition of two liquid-fueled LE-7A main engines at T-minus 5.2 seconds.

After passing a computer-run health check, the H-2B rocket fired four strap-on solid rocket boosters to climb away from the Tanegashima Space Center with more than 2 million pounds of thrust.

Liftoff occurred at 1:05 a.m. local time in Japan, two weeks after a previous H-2B countdown was halted by a dramatic fire on the launch pad.

Japanese engineers called off the mission’s first launch attempt Sept. 10 after the fire, and ground crews returned the H-2B rocket to its assembly building for inspections. Officials determined the fire was likely caused by static electricity and high concentrations of oxygen that dripped from the rocket’s main engines during the Sept. 10 countdown.

After instituting unspecific “corrective actions,” MHI returned the H-2B rocket to the launch pad a half-day before Tuesday’s launch to begin a new countdown.

No such trouble occurred Tuesday, and the H-2B rocket quickly turned to the southeast to climb into space over the Pacific Ocean. The precise launch time Tuesday was set to allow Japan’s eighth H-2 Transfer Vehicle to enter an orbit aligned with the orbital plane of the International Space Station, setting the stage for an automated laser-guided rendezvous Saturday.

The H-2B rocket shed its four solid rocket boosters, payload fairing, and first stage in the first six minutes of the mission. A second stage powered by a single hydrogen-fueled LE-5B engine delivered the HTV supply ship into a preliminary orbit around 15 minutes after liftoff.

Japanese mission controllers confirmed the barrel-shaped HTV launched into an on-target orbit, and the cargo freighter began charging its batteries with its body-mounted solar panels.

Tuesday’s launch made the H-2B rocket eight-for-eight in launches since debuting on Japan’s first HTV resupply mission in 2009.

The HTV 8 mission is also known as Kounotori 8. Kounotori means “white stork” in Japanese.

Packed with some 8,326 pounds (3,777 kilograms) of equipment, experiments and crew provisions, the Kounotori 8 spacecraft will approach the space station in autopilot mode Saturday. The space station crew will use the lab’s Canadian-built robotic arm to capture the HTV supply ship around 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) Saturday, then bring the spacecraft to a berthing port on the station’s Harmony module.

The crew inside the station will get to work unpacking 5,313 pounds (2,410 kilograms) of cargo inside the HTV’s pressurized logistics carrier. Meanwhile, robots outside the station will extract a pallet from the HTV’s unpressurized cargo bay containing six lithium-ion batteries to upgrade the space station’s power system.

Astronauts Nick Hague and Andrew Morgan on the space station will conduct five spacewalks — the first is set for Oct. 6 — to begin installing the fresh batteries, which will replace aging and less-capable nickel-hydrogen batteries on the P6 solar array module on the far port side of the station’s truss backbone.

The Kounotori 8 mission will deliver the third set of six lithium-ion batteries to upgrade the space station’s four huge U.S.-built external power modules, each of which features solar array wings that span 240 feet (73 meters) tip-to-tip. The sixth HTV mission in 2016 carried the first set of new batteries to the station, followed by a second batch last year on the Kounotori 7 resupply mission.

A final set of six batteries will launch on the ninth HTV flight next year.

Each solar array section powers two electrical channels with 12 charging nickel-hydrogen batteries, and NASA is replacing the old batteries in power truss section with six lighter, more efficient lithium-ion batteries.

JAXA uses the HTV missions as part of its contribution to the space station program. Each HTV cargo freighter measures about 33 feet (10 meters) long and about 14 feet (4.4 meters) in diameter.

The Kounotori 8 mission is also carrying food, fresh drinking water, a high-pressure gas tank to recharge the space station’s internal atmosphere with oxygen and nitrogen, and spacewalking tools, such as high-definition cameras and equipment for a series of repair spacewalks planned later this year for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-2 cosmic ray experiment.

The HTV will also deliver research payloads to the space station.

One of the experiments will demonstrate a high-speed satellite laser communications system developed by JAXA and Sony Computer Science Laboratories. The technology demonstrator will test a laser link with a ground station, which can accommodate higher-bandwidth communications than radio systems.

“This technology, which employs a laser for in-orbit mass-data communication, will likely be widely used not only in the telecommunications industry, but in the future as a means of communication in the field of exploration,” said Koichi Wakata, a JAXA vice president, in a statement. “Specifically, it can be used as a means of communication between the Earth and the International Space Station, the moon, and Mars. There is a wide range of potential applications, such as communication with the moon rovers.”

The Small Optical Link for International Space Station, or SOLISS, experiment will be mounted on an experiment platform outside the space station’s Japanese Kibo laboratory module.

“Sony CSL is taking advantage of the in-orbit demonstrations to complete our long-distance laser communication system,” said Hiroaki Kitano, president of Sony CSL. “It will be the first step for Sony to build upon the results of these demonstrations and put it into practical use in society as we commercialize it.

“The opportunity to use Kibo for the in-orbit demonstrations makes it possible to greatly advance the research and development of the optical communication system, much more quickly than if we had launched a small satellite for the same purpose on our own,” Kitano said. “The SOLISS system is built using consumer components. After the demonstrations, we will retrieve the SOLISS unit and perform follow-up analyses, which we expect will further accelerate our commercialization process.”

Japan’s Hourglass experiment also launched on the eighth HTV mission to help scientists investigate the behavior of soil and rock particles under low gravity, simulating the conditions future probes might encounter on a small planet or asteroid.

New hardware for a cellular biology experiment rack is also flying to the space station on the Kounotori 8 spacecraft, expanding the station’s capabilities for biological research.

Three CubeSats are also riding to the station inside the Kounotori 8 spacecraft. Once they arrive at the station, astronauts will transfer them to the Japanese Kibo module, where they will install them into a deployer for release into orbit through an airlock.

The 2-pound (1-kilogram) NARSSCube 1 nanosatellite was developed by Egypt’s National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Science in partnership with the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan. It carries a low-resolution imaging camera.

The AQT-D CubeSat, which weighs 8.1 pounds (3.7 kilograms) and is about the size of a shoebox, will demonstrate a water-based satellite propulsion system. The AQT-D mission is led by the University of Tokyo.

Rwanda’s first satellite, named RWASAT 1, also launched Tuesday. Officials say the satellite will aid agricultural and environmental monitoring.

The Japanese HTV cargo delivery flight is the first of two missions launching to the International Space Station in less than 24 hours.

A Russian Soyuz crew ferry ship is set for liftoff Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan with Russian cosmonaut, NASA astronaut and the first Emirati space flier. The Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft will reach the station less than six hours after liftoff, while the HTV cargo mission is taking a longer rendezvous profile.

Breast or bottle? Apparently, parents of infants have been pondering these options for thousands of years.

So suggests a new study released Wednesday by the journal Nature. The researchers report finding nonhuman milk residue inside a type of ancient spouted clay bowl that sometimes featured animal feet and heads. The earliest examples of this kind of vessel — which the researchers are calling prehistoric baby bottles — date back more than 7,000 years.

""I can just imagine a little prehistoric child being given one of these with milk in it and laughing,"" says the paper's lead author, archaeologist Julie Dunne of the University of Bristol. ""They're just fun. They're like a little toy as well."" She says the animal-shaped vessels seem to represent ""mythical animals"" rather than realistically depicting any particular type of creature.

The researchers say the milk molecules they identified, via chemical and isotopic analysis, came from the ruminant family, which includes sheep, goats and cows. ""This is the first time that we've been able to identify the types of foods fed to prehistoric babies,"" says Dunne.

The vessels that Dunne and her team sampled were found in Bronze Age and Iron Age infant graves in Bavaria, Germany. She says they are a type of pottery that first appeared in the Neolithic period, at a time when Europeans were making the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to agrarian communities. ""It's only when humans begin to domesticate animals that these foods become available to feed or wean infants,"" Dunne says.

The discovery may help explain what was behind a major prehistoric baby boom in that era, according to Siân Halcrow, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Otago, in New Zealand.

Until now, scientists hadn't ""recognized that the introduction of animal milk to infants' diets could have changed a woman's fertility,"" says Halcrow, who was not involved in the study. She wrote a commentary that appears in Nature alongside the new study to provide context.

""There's clinical evidence that when women are breastfeeding, they have a period of infertility,"" says Halcrow. ""So if women aren't constantly suckling their young"" — for example, because they're using animal milk to wean their children earlier — ""they could actually have more babies during their lifetime, and it could result in an increase in population size.""

""This could lead to some of the population changes that we see around the Neolithic [period], with the major demographic explosion,"" she says.

But this expanding population may have come at the expense of individual health. ""Human breast milk is perfect for babies,"" Halcrow says. ""In terms of macronutrients, micronutrients, immune cells. And cow's milk is obviously not as suitable a complete infant food."" She says it's possible that the prehistoric humans were adding animal milk to babies' diets slowly, but if babies were transitioned completely off human milk too early in their lives, ""it could have been extremely detrimental"" to their immune function and nutrition.

""And these bottles would have been so hard to clean,"" Halcrow adds. ""Never mind them not having access to clean water in the first place. But getting into those tiny little spouts? These would have been really unsanitary to use and introduced all kinds of germs into the infant diet.""

One of the vessels showed traces of multiple types of fat, one of which, the scientists say, could have been remnants of human breast milk. ""There's no reason to suppose that women might not have expressed milk into one of these pots for use later, as we do today,"" Dunne says.

Previously, scientists had conjectured that pottery of this type — small, hollow vessels with long, narrow spouts — was used to feed the sick or elderly. As for why scientists are just now discovering that the vessels were used for infants, Dunne says, ""Let's face it. Sometimes research on women tends to be a little bit marginalized compared to research on what the men in prehistoric times were doing out there — you know, fighting, or hunting and gathering, and all that kind of stuff. So you don't get perhaps so much about women and motherhood and children.""

Halcrow agrees. ""It wasn't really until the 1970s and 1980s that archaeologists started to become interested in where women were in the past, and from that they started to look, by extension, at infants and children. So it's only really been the last 15 to 20 years that there's sort of been an explosion of the study of children.""

""Broadening our lens to include infants and children in the past is really important for a number of reasons,"" Halcrow says. ""They made up a high proportion of past populations. And if their health and experience is poor, that's obviously detrimental to society's function.""

""We originally went forward to find vessels in child graves, because that would absolutely confirm for us that they were children's feeding bottles,"" says Dunne. And her team got extra validation — albeit of a more anecdotal variety — from the child of a friend.

""When we gave a reconstructed one to [baby] Noah, it's very intuitive, so it fit just perfectly within a baby's cupped hands. And he loved it,"" Dunne says. ""He started immediately sort of suckling from it. He was really happy, sitting there playing with it and suckling from it for ages."""

The state agency said the patient was a man over the age of 35 who did not live in metro Atlanta. He had a history of heavy nicotine vaping, but no history of vaping THC, which has been linked to a majority of the mysterious vaping-related lung diseases afflicting e-cigarette users.

The death is one of nine confirmed cases in Georgia. The nine people were hospitalized and developed pneumonia with “no known infectious cause,” according to the agency.

In Georgia, those sickened range in age from 18 to 68. The median age of the cases is 26; seven are men.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with states to investigate more than 500 cases of vaping-associated illness. There have been at least eight deaths confirmed in seven states.

No specific e-cigarette device or substance has been linked to all of the cases. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat liquid, turning it into vapor for inhaling. They are an increasingly popular alternative to combustible cigarettes.

Doctors are reporting cases of otherwise healthy patients, many in their late teens and 20s, showing up in emergency rooms gasping for breath and vomiting. The CDC said the outbreak does not seem to be caused by an infection but by chemical exposure, possibly a solvent mixed with nicotine or THC, the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.

But with the cause of illness still unknown, the CDC is urging people to consider refraining from using e-cigarettes. People who decide to continue vaping should not buy vaping products off the street and they should not modify or add any substances to the products.

Symptoms of vaping-associated illnesses, which worsen over time, include cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

The rash of cases has heightened scrutiny of e-cigarettes, even though many health experts consider them less harmful than traditional cigarettes, which release toxins through combustion.

Kevin Burns, the chief executive of Juul, the dominant e-cigarette company in the U.S., stepped down on Wednesday. Juul also announced it is suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the U.S. as it faces mounting investigations, accused of getting teenagers hooked on flavored nicotine pods.

K.C. Crosthwaite, an executive from Altria, the largest U.S. tobacco company and maker of Marlboro cigarettes, replaces Burns. Altria owns a 35% stake in Juul. (Altria is expected to open during the coming weeks a new “heat-not-burn” tobacco product store at Lenox Square in Buckhead, the company’s first store ahead of a national rollout.)

Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has expanded its voluntary recall of two blood pressure medications after trace amounts of a potentially cancer-causing impurity were found during testing.

The recall affects Losartan Potassium Tablets USP and Losartan Potassium/hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Tests of some of those medications revealed amounts of N-methylnitrosobutyric acid (NMBA) that were above the US Food and Drug Administration's daily acceptable levels.

This recall is related to the valsartan recall that has been expanded multiple times since July, when separate lots of blood pressure medications from different companies began being pulled from pharmacy shelves.

The medications all contained either valsartan, losartan or irbesartan and had traces of these impurities that pose a cancer risk to users.

The FDA has begun testing all heart drugs called angiotensin II receptor blockers for these impurities. Also known as ARBs, they block a potent chemical in the blood called angiotensin that causes muscles surrounding blood vessels to contract. When the chemical binds, it narrows the vessels, and that can cause high blood pressure.

What this recall includes

This current expansion includes three additional lots of Losartan Potassium Tablets USP and two lots of Losartan Potassium/Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, USP.

Patients currently taking the medication should continue doing so ""as the risk of harm to the patient's health may be higher if the treatment is stopped immediately without any alternative treatment,"" the FDA said in a press release.

While it is unclear exactly what the cancer risk is of continuing to take the medication, the FDA believes that the risk was low with the recall of valsartan."

Addressing a rowdy and adversarial House of Commons, just hours after flying back early from New York, Johnson went on the attack, accusing Jeremy Corbyn of trying to thwart Brexit and running scared of an election.

Johnson infuriated opposition MPs by dismissing fears that his use of language such as “surrender” and “betrayal” was dangerous in a heightened political climate. To gasps, he claimed the best way to honour the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox was to “get Brexit done”.

And he continued to deploy the “people versus parliament” rhetoric that has become a signature of his premiership, claiming: “The people outside this house understand what is happening … The leader of the opposition and his party don’t trust the people.”

And he added: “Instead of facing the voters the opposition turned tail and fled from an election. Instead of deciding to let the voters decide, they ran for the courts … it is absolutely no disrespect to the judiciary to say I think the court was wrong.”

Johnson’s appearance led critics to accuse him of failing to show any humility over his supreme court defeat.

Responding to the prime minister, Corbyn accused him of failing to take the supreme court defeat seriously, calling his statement, “10 minutes of bluster from a dangerous prime minister who thinks he is above the law but in truth is not fit for the office he holds”.

Labour’s Jess Phillips said: “I know that the prime minister wants to appear as a strong man. But the strongest thing he could do that would look the best to this country at the moment would be to act with some humility and contrition.”

Other female MPs, including Paula Sherriff, attacked the prime minister for repeatedly calling the act put through parliament by Hilary Benn to take no-deal Brexit off the table the “surrender bill”.

She said: “The prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament passed by this house. We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous, inflammatory language for legislation we do not like.”

Recalling the memory of her friend Cox, she said many MPs had received death threats.

“And let me tell the prime minister – they often quote his words, ‘surrender act’, ‘betrayal,’ ‘traitor’: we must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first.”

Johnson replied that he had never heard such “humbug” in all his life. He caused further outrage when telling Labour’s Tracy Brabin, who was elected to Cox’s seat following the MP’s murder by a far-right extremist a week before the EU referendum, that “the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done”.

Cox campaigned for remain. Her widower, Brendan, later wrote on Twitter: “Feel a bit sick at Jo’s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common.”

The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, later suggested all MPs, “have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we’re speaking in this house or outside”.

The exchanges capped a day of dramatic and bad-tempered House of Commons business over Brexit, the likelihood of an election, and the prime minister’s calamitous defeat in the supreme court.

But after scrambling to return early from the UN general assembly’s meeting in the US, Johnson offered little indication of how the government now intends to proceed, instead challenging Labour or any other opposition party to table a motion of no confidence, and promising to set aside parliamentary time on Thursday for MPs to vote on it.

Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have all insisted they will not seek to bring down the government and trigger a general election until a delay to Brexit is secured. But Downing Street suggested that if Labour fails to table a vote of no confidence it will effectively indicate support for Johnson’s strategy.

After Tuesday’s damning judgment, Corbyn said that Johnson “should have done the honourable thing and resigned. Yet here he is, forced back to this house to rightfully face scrutiny, without a shred of remorse or humility and no substance whatsoever.”

He added: “He says he wants an election. I want an election. If he wants an election, it’s very simple. Get an extension and we’ll have an election.”

Labour MP Gloria de Piero of the cross-party MPs for a deal group called for a compromise, urging the prime minister to publish the potential areas of agreement identified in cross-party talks earlier this year.

Johnson responded sympathetically and said he would try to produce something in the coming days. He is likely to need the support of Labour MPs to have any chance of passing a Brexit deal in time for the 31 October deadline.

Despite the supreme court verdict, the Conservatives intend to press ahead with their party conference in Manchester next week. They have tabled a motion, which will be voted on Thursday morning, asking MPs to support shutting down parliament for three days next week to accommodate it.

A government source said: “I cannot guarantee that there won’t be an impact on the economy of Manchester. The Labour party if they are doing this – it will be a nakedly political act.”

Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell had earlier warned that the cost to the city’s economy if the conference was cancelled could be up to £30m.

Labour sources said they had proposed a compromise plan to the Conservatives of debating legislation on which both sides are in agreement next week, including the domestic abuse bill, allowing many Tory MPs to attend the conference.

The domestic abuse bill was dropped as a result of prorogation, along with several others. Labour initially believed the plan had been agreed but it was later rejected.

The Lib Dems have already said they will not support parliament being shut down again. A party source said, “after Boris Johnson unlawfully suspended parliament to stop us scrutinising, the last thing we’re going to do is give them a three-day Tory jamboree”.

After Corbyn’s stinging critique, Johnson hit back with an extended political attack on the leader of the opposition, accusing him of running scared – to which many Conservative MPs responded with rowdy cheers and an extended round of applause.

“Why won’t they allow him to unleash his charms on the electorate? Is it because they are not only terrified that he is going to lose but also even more terrified of the remote possibility that he might win.”

“He can’t control his own party. He can’t decide whether he is for leave or for remain. He’s being held captive by his colleagues,” he said.

Johnson was the fourth minister to address parliament on Wednesday, as MPs took the opportunity to press the government on a series of other issues, including the collapse of travel company Thomas Cook and the situation in Iran.

Earlier, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who advised the government that an extended suspension of parliament would be lawful according to advice leaked on Wednesday, launched an extraordinary attack on MPs.

“This parliament is a dead parliament,” he said. “It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.”"

Boris Johnson has been branded a disgrace for dismissing pleas from Labour MPs to stop using inflammatory language in light of the murder of Jo Cox, telling one that it was “humbug” and another that the best way to honour her was to “get Brexit done”.

Johnson caused uproar in the House of Commons after he responded dismissively to Labour MP Paula Sherriff, who made a heartfelt speech calling on him to stop using language such as “surrender”, “traitor” and “betrayal” in relation to Brexit.

He also drew gasps when telling Labour’s Tracy Brabin, who was elected to Cox’s seat following the MP’s murder by a far-right extremist a week before the EU referendum, that “the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done”.

Before her death, Cox had campaigned to remain in the EU. Her widower, Brendan Cox, swiftly condemned the prime minister’s remarks, saying it had left him feeling sick.

Brendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) Feel a bit sick at Jo’s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common.

Johnson’s attitude was lambasted by Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, who called him a “disgrace” and Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister, who said she felt “disgust watching Johnson”, describing him as “untrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions”. Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, said his reaction showed that Johnson was “a cruel, uncaring, spoilt man”.

Swinson revealed on Wednesday that she had reported to police a death threat against her young child.

Amber Rudd, who resigned from Johnson’s cabinet earlier this month, told ITV the prime minister was being “dishonest and dangerous” in his use of language.

Jess Phillips, the Labour MP and women’s rights campaigner, highlighted an anonymous death threat she had personally received, quoting Johnson’s image that he would rather be dead in a ditch than fail to deliver Brexit. “That is what will happen to those who fail to deliver Brexit,” it said.

“10 Downing Street might think we are ‘humbugs’ about his words but they are literally being used in death threats against me,” she said.

“I get death threats and still I stand up. I don’t surrender to fear and aggression. I don’t surrender to lowest common denominator of fear to votes. I don’t surrender to bullies who call me names. It is not I who have surrendered, it is Boris Johnson. He has surrendered his dignity.”

John Bercow, the Speaker, implicitly rebuked Johnson and told MPs that he had also received threats: “Each and every one of us has a responsibility to weigh his or her words ... with care, eloquence, humour but in terms that demonstrate respect for those who hold a point of view that differs from our own.”

Jeremy Corbyn called on the Speaker to call together the leaders of all parties to issue a joint declaration “opposing any form of abusive language or threats and to put this message out to our entire community that we have to treat each other with respect”.

“If we don’t, then what happens is those on our streets who would do violence feel emboldened to do it and the most vulnerable people in our society suffer as a result of it,” the Labour leader added.

Bercow said he was “very open” to the idea of convening a meeting to draw up a house-wide public statement.

After an aggressive debate in parliament, with the prime minister accusing the opposition of signing a “surrender act” over Brexit, Sherriff received applause from the opposition benches for calling on Johnson to stop using such language.

“We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,” she said.

“And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words ‘surrender act’, ‘betrayal’, ‘traitor’ and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.”

Johnson replied with a half-smile, saying: “I have to say Mr Speaker I’ve never heard such humbug in all my life.”

He was also confronted by Brabin, who criticised him for using language such as “surrender”, arguing it cast his opponents as traitors.

No apologies. Labour fury as Boris Johnson goes on the attack Read more

“As the woman who has taken over a seat left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him in all honesty as a human being please, please will he going forward moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when we’re going about our jobs?” she said.

However, Johnson responded by repeating some of the language and suggesting the answer was to deliver Brexit.

“Of course there will be an attempt to try to obfuscate the effect of this Act, but it does – the capitulation act, or the surrender act or whatever you want to call it – it does, I’m sorry, but it greatly enfeebles, it greatly enfeebles this government’s ability to negotiate.

“But what I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.”

Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, condemned the abuse that MPs had received as “deeply, deeply unpleasant and troubling”.

He said: “We all have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we’re speaking in this house or outside.

“I’m afraid to say it’s something where all sides err from time to time and it would be invidious to pick on individual examples but we have a responsibility of leadership.”

Former Tory Anna Soubry raised a point of order to criticise the prime minister’s language: “It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears ... but I am not alone tonight. There are others who have left the estate such has been the distress.”"

For the time being, Johnson still retains much of the formal power of the prime minister. But the role’s inner power, its moral authority, the holder’s ability to govern and his meaningful capacity to represent the country are practically shot. There is nothing tragic about this for Johnson personally. There is everything tragic for the country that never asked for him to become its leader.

He can’t blame the judges, because he does not dare. He likes to blame MPs, because they are an easy target. But the real blame lies with himself and the Tory hard leavers.

On Tuesday, in the immediate aftermath of the supreme court’s unanimous finding that Johnson’s attempt to silence parliament was unlawful and void, it was still just possible to suppose that the prime minister’s instant reaction in New York was merely foolish and off-the-cuff. While claiming to respect the court, Johnson and his lieutenants had gone into instant denial. Johnson announced that he “disagreed profoundly” with the ruling, as if that disagreement was in any way relevant. Meanwhile in London, Downing Street charged the justices with extending their reach into political matters, and Jacob Rees-Mogg was alleged to have described the ruling as a “constitutional coup”.

Perhaps, after sleeping on the matter, and with the prospect of a resumed parliamentary session in front of them, there was a possibility that the Johnson government would adopt a humbler and more contrite tone in the light of day today. Not a bit of it. First, with Johnson still in the air over the Atlantic, Michael Gove went on a media round and announced that the government had done nothing wrong in suspending parliament in the way that the court had ruled against. Then the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, told the reassembled MPs that the government had acted in good faith, refused to rule out a further prorogation, and then lost it altogether, dismissing parliament as “dead”, “a disgrace” and possessing “no moral right to sit”.

These were merely the warm-up acts for Johnson’s own eventual appearance in the Commons this evening. But they had already pointed unerringly to the strategy that the prime minister was to adopt and which, it was now clear, he had intended to adopt from the very start when he spoke in New York. That strategy was that this is now a naked political fight to the death with the opposition and with the unbelievers. He is not interested in any of the issues on which the judges ruled. All that matters to him is to wade through chaos to Brexit. The twin objectives of the Johnson government when it took office after the ousting of Theresa May – Brexit by the end of October and a general election fought on a “people versus the elites” platform – remain utterly unchanged by the supreme court ruling.

Johnson’s two-month premiership has been based on an audacious and slightly crazy plan. It still is based on it today, even after Tuesday’s humiliation. That plan is the overriding need, as the Tory right sees it, to deliver Brexit after three years, and in so doing marginalise the Brexit party in a general election. The as yet insuperable problem with the plan is that it is fuelled wholly by the kind of bravado and pomposity that Johnson displayed this evening. There is a hung parliament, which means the Johnson Conservatives cannot get their own way without compromises they are not prepared to make. And there is the rule of law, which means they cannot ignore the constitution and the courts.

To Johnson, these are merely distractions. His objective remains to achieve his two goals by hook or by crook, come what may. If parliament supports him, fine. But if parliament opposes him, he will simply bank the defeat and use it to accuse MPs of being determined to frustrate the 2016 vote. Similarly, if the law supports him, that is fine too. But if it doesn’t – and this week it has not – then this too becomes part of the narrative that sees Johnson as the tribune of the leave majority and the courts as part of the resentful, threatened remain minority of establishment bad losers. There are loud echoes here of Donald Trump’s response to this week’s early moves to impeach him.

It may have been tempting, especially for liberals, to imagine that an event like an impeachment process or the supreme court ruling will be generally seen as disturbing enough to change the public mood. Maybe it should be. But it might be wise not to bet the mortgage on that. Most of the public say that they support the rule of law. Most, to judge by the instant polling after this week’s ruling, think it is bad that Johnson broke the law. But that does not mean that they will necessarily turn against Johnson in decisive numbers on issues such as Brexit or parliament’s delay in implementing it.

Modern Britain has undoubtedly become a much more law-respecting society today than it was in the past. This is an enormous change from the mid 20th century. In the 1970s, for instance, belief in the rule of law was far from universal, notably in industrial relations, where several unions boycotted the industrial relations court set up by the Heath government.

But the vestigial belief that the law should keep a certain distance from politics is deep-seated. The trade union movement spent most of its existence believing that the law had no place in industrial relations. Media interests, old and new, often talk in similar terms about the news business. Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court justice, gave his Reith lectures this year on these delicate boundaries. So when Downing Street says the courts are overreaching themselves, they are not playing to an empty house.

Liberal Tories may be deceiving themselves in another way. They continue to believe that Johnson’s aim is really to make a deal with the European Union at the 11th hour. It would be the rational thing to do, they say, and in their own terms they are entirely right. Ken Clarke said this today. David Cameron said much the same in interviews last week. Johnson repeated it last night. All this, though, mistakes the fact that Johnson is rounding the point of no-return. Like Macbeth in blood, he is stepped so far in recklessness that there is no going back to the kind of compromises and trade-offs that even Johnson voted for earlier in the year.

Sooner or later, all this will be put to a general election. When that happens, it is clear that Johnson intends to focus his campaign against the pro-European establishment of liberal Britain. That was his aim in July, and it is still his aim now. He is calculating, in other words, that this week’s defeat in the courts can be leveraged into a much bigger victory at the polls. To be savaged by the judges is indeed humiliating. But if it helps to fire up enough leave voters in enough places to give Johnson some sort of electoral victory under Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system, and with the anti-Tory opposition deeply split, it will all be deemed to have been thoroughly worth it.

Donald Trump pressed the Ukrainian president to work with the US attorney general to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, a damning White House memo revealed on Wednesday, raising the stakes in an acrimonious and polarising impeachment inquiry.

Democrats said the US president’s conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy detailed in the five-page rough “transcript” was a devastating betrayal of his country that merited their investigation, while Republicans claimed it showed no quid pro quo and offered complete vindication.

Favors, dirt, investigations: key takeaways from the Trump-Ukraine memo Read more

The disclosure came a day after Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, announced an official impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower’s complaint regarding alleged violations by Trump, setting the stage for a long and rancorous fight in the run-up to next year’s presidential election. That whistleblower’s complaint was handed over to the US Congress on Wednesday, but the details remained classified. Lawmakers who reviewed the document described it as “deeply disturbing” and “very credible”, and called for it to be made public.

Earlier, some observers expressed surprise that the White House had agreed to release such a damaging memo detailing the 30-minute call between Trump and Zelenskiy on 25 July. Though not a verbatim transcript, it showed that, after being congratulated on his victory in the Ukrainian election, Zelenskiy thanked the US for its military support and said he was almost ready to buy more American weapons.

Trump replied “I would like you to do us a favor, though” and went on discuss possible joint investigations. Later in the conversation, he told Zelenskiy he should work with Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the US attorney general, William Barr, to look into unsubstantiated allegations that Biden, the former vice-president, helped remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it.”

He added: “It sounds horrible to me.”

The previously unknown connection to Barr was a potentially grave development for Trump because it shows he sought to involve the US government with a foreign country to seek dirt on a potential election rival. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden, the current frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

In a rambling press conference late on Wednesday afternoon, while wrapping up his visit to the United Nations general assembly in New York, Trump dismissed the growing Ukraine scandal as “a big hoax” and said he “didn’t threaten anybody”.

The unidentified whistleblower submitted a complaint to Michael Atkinson, the US government’s intelligence inspector general, in August. Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, then blocked the release of the complaint to Congress, citing issues of presidential privilege and saying the complaint did not deal with an “urgent concern”. Atkinson disagreed but said his hands were tied.

Meanwhile, details of the secret whistleblower’s complaint began to emerge in news reports on Wednesday evening.

The New York Times reported that the complaint also raised alarm over how White House staff handled records of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president and that Atkinson feared a national security risk, according to sources.

Q&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" – although the constitution does not specify what “high crimes and misdemeanors” are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam

The House intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, said he would do everything in his power to protect the whistleblower. “I think that what this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing,” he said. According to the Associated Press, lawmakers have yet to learn the identity of the whistleblower.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “Having read the whistleblower complaint, I am even more worried about what happened than when I read the memorandum of the conversation between President Trump and President Zelensky.”

Trump and Zelenskiy came face to face on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Wednesday and the awkward body language was plain. The Ukrainian president told reporters: “I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections of USA. No.”

Zelenskiy added: “Sure, we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I – so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me.”

Trump commented: “In other words, there was no pressure and you know there was no pressure.”

Q&A What is the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal? Show Hide On 25 July, US president Donald Trump called Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the course of the call he reportedly asked the Ukrainian leader eight times to investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden and Biden’s son Hunter. It is additionally reported that Trump ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before the call took place. Biden is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination and take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair – without offering any evidence – of corruption. A US intelligence community whistleblower filed a report after becoming alarmed at Trump’s behaviour in the matter. The White House refused to release the substance of the whistleblower complaint, setting up a confrontation with Congress over the release of information. Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Trump’s personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has admitted asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. It is illegal for a political campaign to accept a “thing of value” from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent – for which Trump appears to have been pushing – would amount to a thing of value.

But Democrats seized on the memo’s contents, saying it showed Trump used his powers not for America’s national security but to hurt Biden and help his own re-election.

Biden said in a statement: “It is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath. He has put his own political interests over our national security interest, which is bolstering Ukraine against Russian pressure.

“It is an affront to every single American and the founding values of our country. This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue. It is a test of our democratic values.”

Pelosi condemned Trump for using taxpayer money to “shake down” other countries for the benefit of his campaign. “The transcript and the justice department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the president’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,” she said. “Clearly, the Congress must act.”

Schiff told reporters: “The notes of the call reflect a conversation far more damning than I and many others had imagined.”

He added: “This is how a mafia boss talks. And it’s clear that the Ukraine president understands exactly what is expected of him.”

Play Video 1:57 Adam Schiff condemns Donald Trump's Ukraine call as a 'mafia shakedown' – video

But the alternative realities that have pervaded American politics for the past three years were still in evidence. Trump and his allies sought to paint a very different picture, insisting that the memo proved his innocence.

The Trump re-election campaign fired off emails seeking to raise funds off the “smear job” by soliciting donations for an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force”.

Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, suggested the impeachment move will boost Trump’s chance of re-election. He said: “Because of their pure hatred for President Trump, desperate Democrats and the salivating media already had determined their mission: take out the president.”

Parscale went on: “The facts prove the president did nothing wrong. This is just another hoax from Democrats and the media, contributing to the landslide re-election of President Trump in 2020.”

There was little sign of Republicans breaking ranks, meaning that even if Trump is impeached by the House, he would not be convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump loyalist, said: “Impeachment over this? What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger. Democrats have lost their minds when it comes to President Trump.”

John Cornyn of Texas said on the Senate floor: “This is a continuation of the election in 2016 where our Democratic friends can’t believe that Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump.”

One of the few dissenting voices was Senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who said: “My reaction was the same as I had a few days ago, which is this remains deeply troubling and we’ll see where it leads. But my first reaction is it’s troubling.”

Trump had confirmed that he ordered the freezing of nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine a few days before the call, claiming the US was paying more than its fair share – rather than any threat of blackmail or quid pro quo. The aid was eventually released under pressure from Congress.

The Ukraine scandal erupted after an intelligence community whistleblower came forward. Democrats have been demanding details of the whistleblower’s complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is to testify before the House on Thursday.

On Wednesday it also emerged that the intelligence community’s inspector general told the acting director of national intelligence that the call could have been a federal campaign finance violation. But the justice department determined the president did not commit a crime after prosecutors reviewed a rough transcript.

The justice department also denied that Trump had sought to involve Barr.

Privatisation of NHS care will be significantly curbed under confidential plans that health service bosses expect Downing Street to include in the Queen’s speech next month.

Local NHS bodies in England would no longer have to put out to tender any contract worth at least £615,278. That requirement has contributed to a big increase in outsourcing of services and a record £9.2bn of the NHS’s budget now being handed to private firms.

Under NHS England’s proposals, Boris Johnson would have to scrap key elements of Andrew Lansley’s shake-up of the NHS in England in 2012, which bitterly divided the then coalition government.

The Guardian has obtained an NHS England document which summarises 22 key changes it believes will be included in an NHS reform bill due to be published next month.

A twin-pronged attempt to severely restrict future privatisation would involve scrapping section 75 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and removing the commissioning of healthcare services from the remit of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.

The proposals also seek to limit the role of competition between different parts of the NHS, which critics claim has proved costly, damaging and a distraction from caring for patients.

The proposals are likely to gain government backing because NHS England was asked to draw them up by Theresa May when she was prime minister, in order to allow changes in how the health service operates to go ahead as part of its ambition under the long-term plan to integrate care.

“This is long overdue. These proposals would protect the NHS from the worst excesses of privatisation and end the situation where different parts of the health service have had to compete against each other,” said Sara Gorton, the head of health at the union Unison.

“Our precious NHS needs to be in the best possible state so it’s protected when the UK leaves the EU, whether it’s with or without a deal. It must be able to fend off the circling vultures who would see it torn up in pursuit of profit.”

Section 75 of the 2012 act led to NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) tendering thousands of mainly small-value contracts, 40% of which were won by private firms. That led to an increased fragmentation of NHS care, with profit-driven companies taking over key types of diagnostic and treatment services.

The plans are likely to become public at NHS England’s board meeting on Thursday.

Dr Tony O’Sullivan, the co-chair of Keep Our NHS Public and a retired paediatrician, backed the repeal of section 75. “Some of the most controversial clauses have led to the carve-up of the NHS into contracts and a competitive market.”

But the bill should go further and outlaw all privatisation of any clinical services and reinstate the NHS as the sole provider of its own array of services, he added.

NHS England’s controversial attempt to take PET-CT cancer scanning services in the Thames Valley away from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS trust and hand them to the firm InHealth showed that it could not be trusted, he suggested. The plan caused an outcry and NHS England was forced to back down.

In a break with normal procedure NHS England officials, led by its national director of strategy Ian Dodge, have drafted the bill, rather than the Department of Health and Social Care.

It will also include proposals to:

• Allow the creation of a new type of NHS trust, called “integrated care providers”.

• Let NHS England and NHS Improvement, the service’s financial regulator, extend their already close working relationship into a full, legal merger.

• End the Competition and Markets Authority’s role in the NHS, which could lead to more NHS trusts merging.

The cross-party Commons health and social care select committee has already given its backing to NHS England’s proposed legislative changes."

But just a few months after his return to the cabinet after several years out in the cold, Shapps appears to have followed Grayling’s example rather too closely – lifting sections of his speech to the House of Commons on the collapse of Thomas Cook from Grayling’s equivalent statement when Monarch Airlines went bust in 2017.

At the beginning of his statement, Shapps appears to have followed Grayling’s text almost to the letter, simply substituting Thomas Cook for Monarch and adjusting numbers.

“With your permission, I would like to make a statement about the steps the government have been taking to support those affected by the collapse of Monarch Airlines Thomas Cook, in particular the 110,000 150,000 passengers left abroad without a flight back to the UK and the almost 2,000 9,000 people who have lost their jobs.”

At times, Shapps ad-libbed. But at other times, the exact wording was only changed by an acronym: “Normally, the CAA’s responsibility for bringing passengers back would extend only to customers whose trips are covered by Atol the air travel organisers’ licence scheme.”

Luckily, most details – even the page views on the CAA’s website – were more or less the same. Shapps said, as did Grayling: “There have been more than 200 39 ,000 calls to our customer service centres, There have been more than 1 2 million unique visitors to a dedicated website— http:// monarch .thomascook.caa.co.uk— with over and 7 million page views.”

But some of the lifted sections were more than merely technical. Shapps’s people, like Grayling’s, had “been in contact with members whose constituencies have been hardest hit by these job losses. They have our assurance that we will work with them and the industry to offer what support we can.”

Both said “efforts are rightly focused on” getting people into new jobs and getting passengers home. And Shapps, like Grayling, said: “I have been hugely impressed.”

Both expressed their heartfelt response to the situation, adding: “Despite those robust plans … this is an incredibly distressing situation is hugely distressing for all concerned.”

Reflecting on Thomas Cook’s history, Shapps also used Grayling’s text as a starting point: “The loss of an iconic major British brand that was close to celebrating its half-century with a 178-year history is a really sad moment. However, it should not be seen as a reflection on the general health of the UK aviation sector, which continues to thrive.”

As Grayling put it, word for word, Shapps also said: “We have never had the collapse of an airline or holiday company on this scale before, and we have responded swiftly and decisively.”

For a finale, he pledged to do in weeks what Grayling said would take months: “We need to look at all the options – not just Atol, but whether it is ​possible to enable airlines to wind down in a an more orderly manner.”

With a final flourish, Shapps said: “Our effort will turn to working through any the reforms necessary to ensure that passengers do not find themselves in this position ridiculous situation again.”

The apparent lifting of Grayling’s text is not the first time Shapps, who was sacked from the cabinet in 2015, has found himself in an awkward position.

In 2015, he was forced to admit that he had “over-firmly denied” having a second job under a pseudonym selling a “get-rich-quick” scheme while sitting as an MP.

After he left the cabinet he stood down as a minister amid allegations that he had ignored repeated bullying allegations against a party youth organiser.

Shapps responded on Twitter: “Although I wasn’t aware that some of these words had been used before, the message in my statement stands true and I will follow through by delivering airline administration reform!”"
153,,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/26/vicious-cycle-delicate-wash-releases-more-plastic-microfibres,2019-09-26T00:01:47,Vicious cycle: delicate wash releases more plastic microfibres,"Delicate wash cycles should be avoided whenever possible, according to scientists who found they can release hundreds of thousands more plastic microfibres into the environment than standard wash cycles.

Researchers at Newcastle University ran tests with full-scale machines to show that a delicate wash, which uses up to twice as much water as a standard cycle, releases on average 800,000 more microfibres than less water-hungry cycles.

“Our findings were a surprise,” said Prof Grant Burgess, a marine microbiologist who led the research. “You would expect delicate washes to protect clothes and lead to less microfibres being released, but our careful studies showed that in fact it was the opposite.”

“If you wash your clothes on a delicate wash cycle the clothes release far more plastic fibres. These are microplastics, made from polyester. They are not biodegradable and can build up in our environment.”

The finding challenges the assumption that more aggressive washing cycles, which use less water, change direction more frequently and spin at higher speeds, release more fibres into wastewater. Instead, the volume of water used per wash appears to be the most important factor in dislodging fibres from clothing, the study found.

“If the water volume is high, the water will bash the clothes around more than if less water is used,” Burgess said. “The water forces its way through the clothing and plucks fibres of polyester from the textiles.”

The clothing industry produces more than 42m tonnes of synthetic fibres every year. The vast majority, about 80%, are used to make polyester garments. Previous tests have found that washing synthetic items can release between 500,000 and 6m microfibres per wash.

Because many washing machines lack filters that can remove microplastics from their wastewater, the fibres are carried into water treatment plants and can eventually reach the seas. The particles, which come from a variety of sources, are now ubiquitous in the environment, from the deepest marine trench in the Pacific Ocean to the pristine wilderness of Antarctica. Scientists have found the plastics in organisms at every level of the food chain from plankton to marine mammals.

It is unclear what health risk easily ingested microplastics pose to marine life, but researchers fear toxic chemicals in the plastics, and other compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which stick to them, could be harmful to the animals. The particles may also help spread disease-causing viruses and bacteria.

The Newcastle team measured the amount of microfibres released from black polyester T-shirts, first in a series of lab tests that mimicked full-scale washing machines, and then in real washing machines at a Procter & Gamble research centre. The results showed that earlier recommendations to use more water and less aggressive washing cycles may actually be releasing more microfibres into the environment.

Some washing machine manufacturers are introducing microfibre filters, but Mark Kelly, the first author of the study published in Environmental Science and Technology, said avoiding delicate washes and half loads would help to reduce the amounts of microfibres released by washing.

“This research is important as it helps to identify how microfibres are reaching the marine environment,” said Prof Tamara Galloway, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the study.

“We have found microplastics in most of the marine animals we study, including turtles, seals and dolphins. Microfibres are the type of microplastics we find most frequently. Whilst we can’t say for sure what the health impacts of ingesting microfibres from textiles might be, minimising exposure has got to be a high priority for protecting the marine environment and the food chain.”"

After a minister said that necessary checks on the firm to ensure it was UK-based involved verifying it had “a British phone number”, the Guardian called the number and got through to a US-based member of staff who would not confirm her exact location.

The development came after opposition MPs raised questions in the Commons about how a grant aimed at fostering UK talent in cyber-skills was awarded this year to a company run by Jennifer Arcuri, a US technology entrepreneur and friend of Johnson’s who is now based in California, despite appearing to fail to meet government criteria.

The new digital minister, Matt Warman, insisted that his department had done the “usual due diligence” on the company, Hacker House, but confirmed a review into how the money had been granted.

Warman said: “This is a company that is based in Britain as far as Companies House is concerned. It is a company with a British phone number. We will review that, but we have no reason to think that there is anything untoward in this particular matter.”

Facing Johnson later on in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn demanded to know whether the prime minister had initiated the review of the award, whether he would co-operate with it and whether he would refer himself to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, for investigation.



Johnson did not address the Labour leader’s questions, and replied: “I am very proud of everything I did as mayor.”

When the Guardian called Hacker House’s UK number it got through to a recorded message with a US accent that said: “Thank you for calling Hacker House, the receptionist will be right with you.”

A woman with a US accent then answered the call, but would not give her location other than saying that it was somewhere in the US. She added: “I don’t have a specific location information to provide. I’m in an offsite location. I’m not allowed to release that type of information. I’m in the United States.”

It has also emerged that in 2016 Arcuri admitted that Hacker House employed the hacker Lauri Love, who is wanted by the US authorities for breaking into US websites.

She told Love’s extradition hearing in 2016 that she met him the previous year and at the time he worked for Hacker House from Thursday to Monday.

Arcuri’s husband, Matthew Hickey, claimed on Twitter that the company employed several “several British people”.

Hacker Fantastic (@hackerfantastic) It was awarded for development of our portal (which is up and running, maybe that should be news?). We employe several British people who work on it. There's nothing improper about it and we have been regularly updating DCMS and working with UK government on its needs.

According to LinkedIn, only four of the 11 employees recorded on the site are located in the UK, and one of them is Arcuri, who moved to the US last year.

In the House of Commons, Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “The truth is our prime minister does reckless things. He is a man whose character renders him unfit for the office he holds.”

Johnson is under increasing pressure to explain his friendship with Arcuri, whose east London flat was reportedly visited frequently by the prime minister while he was in City Hall. She also attended three overseas trade missions led by Johnson and was given tens of thousands of pounds in City Hall funds during his time as mayor.

The Sunday Times, which broke the story, said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her.

The Lib Dem MP Layla Moran tabled an urgent question asking why Hacker House received the grant this year and whether Johnson was involved in the award of the grant.

Referring to his proroguing of parliament having been found to be unlawful, she said: “The fact that we are back in the Commons today is because the prime minister has been shown to ride roughshod over the laws of this land. It would indeed be disappointing if we were to find that the prime minister has form in bending the rules for personal or political gain.”

She also pointed out that the £100,000 grant exceeded 50% of the company’s income and thus broke one of the criteria for the scheme. She asked: “Why did officials waive the rule that the grant could not exceed 50% of the company’s collective income?”

Warman said neither the prime minister nor any MP had lobbied for the money, but that the department had launched a review of the process.

“The prime minister and his staff had no role in the awarding of this grant,” he said.

Arcuri’s company Innotech was given £10,000 in sponsorship from a mayoral organisation in 2013, the Sunday Times reported. Johnson was also the guest speaker at several of its events, and appeared in a Google hangout alongside Arcuri.

“I’m always happy to hang out at Innotech,” the then mayor told Arcuri in 2014.

A year later Arcuri won a £15,000 grant under a government programme to encourage foreign entrepreneurs in the UK, the Sunday Times report alleged.

The newspaper suggested that Arcuri was initially refused permission to attend two of the trade trips because her business did not meet the eligibility criteria. But after an intervention by Johnson, she was allowed on to the missions, according to an email seen by the paper.

The Guardian disclosed that in 2014 Arcuri’s company hosted a “tech v brains” summit in parliament that was booked by the Tory MP George Freeman, who backed Johnson in the Conservative leadership race and serves as a minister in his government.

Freeman and Arcuri took part in a panel discussion at the event with entrepreneurs and policymakers about “the digital revolution”. Pictures show guests enjoying drinks and paté, tofu and mini chicken poppadom canapés at the event. Commercial rates for a half-day event in the terrace pavilion are £3,000.

Len Duvall, the chair of the Greater London assembly oversight committee, has written to Johnson requesting details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri during his time in office, demanding a response within a fortnight.

Johnson’s successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, has ordered an inquiry into the alleged conflict of interest, asking the London fire brigade general counsel, Kathryn Robinson, to report back on the issue."

Greek police are investigating what they described as an accident on the island of Skiathos, in which a British man is said to have run over his wife, killing her as he tried to park his car outside their villa.

The incident occurred after the couple, who had long holidayed on the popular Sporades island, returned home from a night out in the early hours of Wednesday. The woman, also said to be British, died instantly.

“An inquiry is being conducted,” said police spokeswoman Chryssa Panayiotou. “It seems to have been an accident. The 58-year-old woman was lying on the ground when her 62-year-old husband drove into her, not knowing she was there.”

Police said while it was premature to rush to conclusions, the woman appeared to have got out of the car under the influence of alcohol before collapsing. “The incident happened at around 2.30am,” added the spokeswoman. “Her body was immediately taken to the health centre on Skiathos. An autopsy will be conducted in the coming days.”

Police said the couple, who have not been named, spent long stints on the island, residing there every year between May and November.

The man, who was arrested but released pending trial on the order of a public prosecutor, underwent medical tests on Wednesday to ascertain alcohol levels in his blood. “We want to see to what degree he was under the influence,” said Panayiotou.

Despite the Briton being charged with involuntary manslaughter the case was being treated as an accident, according to authorities. A coroner in the central Greek town of Larissa is expected to carry out an autopsy.

Skiathos, where much of the blockbuster Mamma Mia! was filmed, is hugely popular among Britons. The incident had shocked many on the island, according to local media."

Christopher King, the chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS), was due to tell his organisation’s annual conference on Thursday that private schools offered a “premium product” for pupils, without the rote learning and changes inflicted by the previous education secretary Michael Gove on state schools in England.

He also claims that private schools survive because they are better at providing a “holistic education” , and urges the government to issue education vouchers for parents to spend on school fees.

His defence of private schools follows a vote at the Labour conference on Sunday, when the party adopted new manifesto policies that would strip them of charitable status, add VAT to fees, restrict their pupils’ access to higher education, and redistribute their endowments, investments and properties to the state sector.

In his speech to prep school heads and governors, King attacked the “truly toxic portrayal” of private schools as being aloof from their community. He also accused critics of the sector of being hypocrites for allowing “selection by postcode and house price”, when parents buy expensive houses close to leading state schools.

Play Video 7:03 Should we abolish private schools? – video

“For me, that smacks of hypocrisy. How can these people attack parents for paying for their children’s education when they are doing exactly the same thing but via a different route?” King said.

“Social mobility, or the lack of it, is a major problem in this country. The easy cheap shot is to blame us who educate no more than 12% of the nation’s children. Really?

“Visit a typical independent school classroom with children of any age and you will see a more ethnically diverse group of faces looking back at you than is likely to be the case elsewhere.”

However, the headteacher of a state primary school in the south-east of England, speaking anonymously, rejected that claim, saying: “Any state school is more diverse in terms of backgrounds and incomes than the most diverse prep school, even in the wealthiest areas. Prep schools usually offer no bursaries or financial scholarships, they are worse in that respect than public schools.”

King’s organisation represents 600 prep and junior schools in England with around 160,000 pupils, educating children up to the age of 13. According to the Independent Schools Council, the average annual fee is just over £13,000 a year for day pupils.

In his defence of the sector, he was due to say: “There is no denying we offer a premium product and there is a cost for this but in turn it produces results.

“There are regional differences, but the state per-pupil primary-age funding level is circa £5,000. The comparable figure for independent schools is two and a half times this. What does this extra per-pupil funding bring apart from excellent facilities? More, specialist teachers from an early age, smaller class sizes and a commitment to the development of the individual.”

He contrasts the “Michael Gove-directed changes focused on the rote and robotic” in state schools with the autonomy enjoyed by private school heads, “free of the shackles of government ministers’ diktat”.

“It is a simple truth that one of the great joys, and indeed responsibilities of being a head in an independent school is that you get the freedom to choose the curriculum and co-curricular shape that is best for the pupils in the school.”

The National Association of Head Teachers said all heads faced restrictions on what they could do and teach.

“In almost every case, whether you’re in the state sector or elsewhere, the headteacher’s office comes equipped not just with a desk and chair but a straitjacket too,” the NAHT said in response to King’s speech.

“Accountability, funding, data and problems with recruitment – all well known in the state sector – all act against school leaders who want to use the freedom and autonomy that come with the role. In the independent sector, there are different problems.

“Good leadership is about having a clear plan to overcome whatever obstacles you face in a way that works for you, your school and its pupils.”"

A British court has said it has no power to stop the deportation of a 10-year-old girl at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM) after authorities rejected her mother’s asylum application.

The girl’s mother, who travelled to Britain from Bahrain and would be sent back there if deported, had expressed fears authorities there could force her and her daughter to return to Sudan, where she is originally from.

Sudan has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world. Most girls there undergo the practice, which involves the partial or total removal of external genitalia, aged between five and nine.

A family court had ruled that the girl could be subjected to FGM if taken abroad after social services applied for a protection order to stop her being deported.

But Britain’s Home Office, which handles immigration issues, challenged the court’s power to prevent her deportation and on Wednesday the court accepted it did not have such powers.

Britain claims it protects girls from FGM. So why are we deporting them? | Charlotte Proudman Read more

The Home Office did not respond to a request for comment on the case by the time of publication.

The UK has invested heavily in efforts to combat FGM in countries where it is practised, notably in parts of Africa, and is viewed as an international leader in the field.

But Charlotte Proudman, the lawyer who represented the girl’s mother in court, said there was a contradiction between the government’s stated commitment to end FGM and its immigration policies.

“They are happy to prosecute FGM, they are happy to give money abroad to stamp it out, but they are failing to protect women who are at risk if deported,” Proudman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

FGM is linked with severe long-term complications including cysts, infections and complications in childbirth. In the most severe cases, the vaginal opening is sewn up.

The girl’s mother said she had undergone FGM, as had her two sisters, who both died as a result, according to court papers.

One of the single biggest indicators that a girl is at risk is her mother having been cut, studies have shown.

About 87% of Sudan’s women aged between 15 and 49 have been cut, and the majority have undergone the severest form, infibulation, according to the World Health Organization.

Although FGM is a recognised ground for asylum in Britain, the Home Office – the government department responsible for immigration – has previously argued that the risk in similar cases was low.

Proudman said she would ask the government to accept expert assessments of the risks the girl faced if deported and grant her secure immigration status.

Anti-FGM campaigner Alimatu Dimonekene said authorities were failing to consider the rights of children when processing the asylum applications of their parents.

“This girl will be at risk not only of FGM if she returns to these countries, but will be at risk of other known extreme forms of violence,” added Dimonekene, who runs the charity A Girl At A Time."

The drinking vessels, which were excavated from children’s graves in Bavaria, date to between 450 and 1,200BC. They have teat-shaped spouts, appear designed to be easily held by an older baby or toddler and one is shaped as an imaginary animal, suggesting it may have doubled as a toy.

Julie Dunne, a chemist at the University of Bristol and lead author, said: “These very small, evocative, vessels give us valuable information on how and what babies were fed thousands of years ago, providing a real connection to mothers and infants in the past.”

The finding suggests that a shift towards weaning babies earlier could have played a crucial role in a population boom that occurred in the Neolithic period, around the same time that some humans moved away from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle towards one that depended on crops and animals. “It could help explain why Neolithic women can suddenly have many more babies,” said Dunne. “There’s so much more to it than the baby bottle.”

Small feeding vessels, made from clay, first appear in Europe in the Neolithic (at around 5,000 BC), and become more commonplace during the bronze and iron ages that follow. However, it has not been clear whether the pots were specifically made for babies – it has also been suggested they were used to feed the sick or elderly.

Ancient Britons travelled hundreds of miles to stone circle feasts Read more

The latest findings provide a vital link, showing that three vessels found in child burial sites were filled with animal milk. A chemical analysis of lipids that survived in the bottom of the pot suggests that the milk would have come from a cow, goat or sheep.

The children that the bottles were found alongside had ages of between one to two years, around two and under six years.

Katharina Rebay-Salisbury, a co-author from the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, said: “Bringing up babies in prehistory was not an easy task. We are interested in researching cultural practices of mothering, which had profound implications for the survival of babies.”

She said that the development of bottles could have made mothering a more “collective” responsibility, at a time when people were starting to live in larger groups, with some settlements of several hundred people. Stopping breastfeeding infants at an earlier age could also have led to shorter gaps between siblings.

Rebay-Salisbury, who is leading a major project on motherhood in prehistory, said that there is a growing realisation that studying how children lived in the past could provide crucial insights into ancient societies. “For a long time, people were just interested in swords and men,” she said. “Gradually we’re discovering that there were other people as well who deserve our attention, including children and mothers.”

The team is planning to analyse other, similar artefacts. “Similar vessels, although rare, do appear in other prehistoric cultures, such as Rome and ancient Greece, across the world,” said Dunne. “Ideally, we’d like to carry out a larger geographic study and investigate whether they served the same purpose.”

The analysis is published in the journal Nature."

Interactions with Amazon’s virtual personal assistant Alexa could soon become considerably more entertaining – and profane – after actor Samuel L Jackson signed up to lend his voice to the device.

The Hollywood star is the first celebrity voice to be rolled out on Alexa, in a feature that will be made available to users later this year for a fee, according an announcement by the tech and retail giant on Wednesday.

The Jackson feature will allow users of Alexa-enabled devices to interact with an AI version of the actor developed using the company’s neural text-to-speech technology. Jackson is not the first celebrity to feature on Alexa, but previous celebrity voice features have relied upon pre-recorded audio.

Jackson’s delivery of expletive-laden one-liners in films such as Pulp Fiction, Shaft, A Time To Kill, Die Hard With A Vengeance, the Star Wars prequels and The Avengers, have entered cultural canon. In some cases – such as his plea to “get these motherfucking snakes off this motherfucking plane” in the 2006 B-grade romp Snakes on a Plane – his lines have become synonymous with the films themselves.

Jackson has said in the past that he is asked by fans weekly to reproduce his famous performance in Pulp Fiction, in which he recites biblical passage Ezekiel 25:17.

The Alexa feature promises to make liberal use of Jackson’s reputation for colourful language, but users will have the capacity to turn swearing on and off.

Amazon suggested on Wednesday that more celebrity voices will be added in 2020.

The feature was one of a number of updates to Alexa announced at Amazon’s annual hardware exhibition in Seattle on Wednesday.

Other updates included new privacy options such as auto-deletion of voice recordings, and new commands that force the program to reveal the data it has collected.

The privacy features come in the wake of concerns about the company’s retention and treatment of users’ data, and the ability of its devices to record conversations.

A suite of new gadgets was also unveiled on Wednesday, extending the company’s reach into its customers’ homes and lifestyles, including earbuds, glasses, a pet tracker and a smart oven."

In this new screwball comedy, an American reality show host and a Ukrainian TV comedian somehow find themselves elected president and almost get away with it – until a seemingly routine phone call ends up determining the fate of both their nations.

It is a script that has bypassed the big screen to go straight to reality in 2019, and it was playing on Wednesday in both Washington and New York.

Favors, dirt, investigations: key takeaways from the Trump-Ukraine memo Read more

When Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy sat down in front of the cameras at the UN general assembly, the scene had already been set. A phone call the two men held in July had triggered a political crisis in Washington, and the fourth impeachment proceedings ever against a US president.

According to the version released by the White House, when Zelenskiy asked Trump about US military support for his embattled country, Trump said: “I would like you to do us a favour though” and went on to suggest, repeatedly, that Zelenskiy’s government launch an investigation into Trump’s possible opponent in next year’s presidential elections, Joe Biden.

Shortly before the call, Trump is reported to have ordered US military aid to Ukraine to be suspended.

The incident sounded sufficiently like a shakedown to push even a reluctant Democratic leadership into embarking on impeachment. As far as Trump was concerned, however, there was nothing wrong with the conversation which, he said again and again, was “perfect”.

Sitting alongside the US president, Zelenskiy looked very much like the high school teacher-turned-president he used to play on his longrunning political sitcom, The Servant of the People, bewildered at the absurdities unfolding before him.

“Better to be on TV than on the phone,” he joked, though nothing about his demeanour suggested that was true. He looked unhappy from the beginning, and when Trump turned to him and declared: “I really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem”, Zelenskiy looked like he was going to be sick.

His “problem” was that part of his country had been annexed by Putin, and Russian military intervention had turned another part into a battleground. Hours before meeting Trump, the Ukrainian leader had stood in front of the UN general assembly and held up a bullet in an effort to remind the international community of the largely forgotten conflict.

“There is no such thing as someone else’s war,” Zelenskiy had said. “None of you will be able to feel safe as long as there is a war in Ukraine, a war in Europe.”

In his afternoon encounter with Trump, the war was quickly forgotten once more and the Ukrainian president found that, on his debut on the global stage, he had wandered into a whodunnit in which he was prime witness.

So had his arm been twisted by Trump to investigate Joe Biden? the press wanted to know. Zelenskiy’s discomfort was overwhelming. On one hand, his government’s relationship with the US, its most important military backer, was at stake. On the other, his side of the July conversation made him sound like a sycophant, constantly flattering Trump and offering to take guidance from the US president in domestic Ukrainian investigations. It was unlikely to play well back home.

“I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,” Zelenskiy said. “We had a good phone call… It was normal. You read it. Nobody pushed me.”

That was all Trump needed. A couple of hours later, he flourished the phrase like a get-out-of-jail card.

“No push, no pressure, no nothing. It’s all a big hoax,” Trump said. But at his first press conference as a president formally facing impeachment, he appeared deflated and consumed with self-pity.

One by one, he listed all the countries whose leaders he had met over three days at the UN.

“I came early in the morning to late in the evening, meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country and the press didn’t cover any of this,” Trump said, reprising a favourite theme when under pressure: that none of his predecessors – presumably not even Lincoln who was shot in the head – had suffered as much.

“So many leaders came up to me today and they said, sir, what you go through, no president has ever gone through,” the president said.

Trump seemed to be untouchable – that may have just changed Read more

For more than 20 minutes, he read through a rambling litany of his achievements, from domestic to foreign but ending up at the wall on the southern border, and allowed only a couple of questions.

When asked whether it was appropriate for a US president to use his office to persuade a foreign leader to dig up dirt on his opponents, Trump accused his opponents of doing the same thing. It looked likely to be his strategy through the long months of impeachment that lie ahead for his presidency. His enemies had simply projected their own wrongdoing on to him, and he was the hero betrayed in the final act.

“It was all planned,” he concluded darkly. “Like everything else it was all planned and the witch hunt continues.”"

She became known as ‘Emily Doe’ – and her assailant served just three months in prison. Now she’s ready to tell the world who she really is

It has been just over three weeks since Chanel Miller allowed her name to become public and the 27-year-old is still trying to adjust. For a while, it seemed as if everyone she had ever known was going to email. “Hi! We were in bio-chem class together, how are you doing?!” she’d read. Or: “Hey, I always knew you’d write a book!” She smiles at the bleak comedy of a situation which no one, least of all Miller herself, knows quite how to handle. At some point in the emails, every sender would jettison the pleasantries and make the awkward turn towards saying: “I’m sorry.”

Around midnight on 17 January 2015, Miller was spotted by two students at Stanford University being sexually assaulted by a third student as she lay unconscious on the ground behind some bins. She was 22, a recent graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, working in her first job at a tech firm and living with her parents in Palo Alto. Earlier that evening she had, on a whim, agreed to accompany her younger sister to a fraternity party at Stanford University, a 10-minute drive from the house. By the early hours of the morning, Miller was in a hospital having her vagina and anus swabbed by police doctors – and 19-year-old Brock Turner was in custody.

What happened next has become a textbook example of the double standards applied to sexual assault victims and their assailants. While Turner was characterised as a champion swimmer, conscientious student and upstanding young man surely incapable of assault, Miller became the “drunk girl at the party”.

In that moment, her life split in two. To the majority of her friends and family, she was still Chanel – an anglicised version of her Chinese name, Zhang Xiao Xia – albeit a more muted version of the woman they knew. Within the legal system, and in a small, dark chamber of her own mind, she was “Emily Doe”, the pseudonym of the “Brock Turner sexual assault victim”, a woman reduced to the sum total of what someone else had done to her. After Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault and sentenced to just six months in prison – of which he ultimately served three – Miller read out a victim impact statement in court. “You don’t know me,” she said, addressing Turner directly, “but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today.” Over 12 subsequent pages, Miller delineated, with devastating precision, the experience of being sexually assaulted by a man for whom the legal system had more sympathy than his victim. In June 2016, when the statement was published by BuzzFeed, more than 18 million people read it.

Three years later, Miller is sitting opposite me in a conference room at a publishing house in New York, her memoir, Know My Name, on the table before us. Miller is slight and softly spoken, with long hair and a mildly sardonic air, the kind of details that the victim in a sexual assault is used to having raised. Since the trial, every decision Miller makes – what to wear, how to comport herself, the extent to which she should smile or not smile, where she should go and what route she should take to get there – has, for a split-second, been refracted through what she calls “the lens of court”, a reflex audit of how her most trivial choices might be levelled against her by lawyers. “I know how to dismiss and turn down the volume on those voices, that question and reprimand,” she says, “but it’s all there and it is really inhibiting.”

Know My Name is written in vivid, punishing detail. The fraternity house has “a sour, yeasty atmosphere, where you could hear the soles of your shoes unpeeling from sticky floors”. After the assault, Miller’s body is “a nerveless mannequin”. She is bitterly funny about the dehumanising absurdity of the rape processing suite, where, after being swabbed and photographed (“I wondered if I was suppose to smile with teeth, where I should be looking”) she is given some sweatpants and a pamphlet, which together seem to say: “Welcome to the club, here’s your new uniform. In your folder you’ll find guidelines that will lay out the steps of trauma and recovery which may take your entire lifetime.”

The amazing thing, says Miller, is that at the time, the circumstances of her assault seemed so open and shut that in her innocence she imagined there was no case to be answered. “If someone is found humping an unmoving body, what is the case?” she says now. The case was one of consent; Turner pleaded innocent and claimed not only to have asked Miller “if she wanted me to finger her”, but to have asked if she liked it and heard her confirm: “Uh-huh.”

You get to choose how the experience serves you; what you draw from it. I use my anger as fuel, my grief as strength

More broadly, however, the case turned less on the specifics of Miller’s conduct that night and more on her credibility as a victim. Miller’s sexual history, relationship status and the question of whether or not she “did a lot of partying in college” were all considered permissible points of access for Turner’s defence, as was the fact that, prior to blacking out and waking up in the hospital, she had peed outside. A man who drunkenly takes a leak under a tree is unremarkable; a woman who does so is lewd.

There were other biases at work, among them the broad assumption that alcohol excuses sexual assault, particularly on campus. Oddly, this presumption is nowhere more starkly on display than in journalist Malcolm Gladwell’s new book, Talking to Strangers – the publicity for which promises to examine a “series of encounters and misunderstandings” between people and in which he quotes extensively from Miller’s case.

Set aside, for a moment, the ethics of a man using the raw transcript of a woman’s sexual assault trial to prop up his theory about communication, and focus on Gladwell’s assertion that: “People v. Brock Turner is a case about alcohol.” The entire case, Gladwell writes, “turned on the degree of Emily Doe’s drunkenness”.

From a narrow legal point of view, Gladwell is correct. But in answer to the question: “How did an apparently harmless encounter on a dancefloor end in a crime?” Gladwell describes the assault as a “transparency failure on steroids”, and offers the apparently blithe summary: “A young woman and a young man meet at a party, then proceed to tragically misunderstand each other’s intentions – and they’re drunk.” Little credence is given to the possibility raised at the trial that Turner, far from “misunderstanding” the signals from Miller, could have understood them perfectly, nor that the pivotal disinhibiting agent in this case may not have been alcohol but misogyny. An unconscious woman cannot object when a man inserts his fingers and foreign objects into her vagina; what Emily Doe did or didn’t want was irrelevant.

At mention of Gladwell, Miller smiles and zips her mouth. Who needs it? But a moment later, she says: “We say alcohol is the cause, but to me it’s such a small way of thinking. Alcohol could never be the root of something that is part of such a greater pattern: when you look at the thousands of cases [of violence against women], the common thread is not that we are drinking too much. The fact that we continue to minimise and rationalise violence is so insanely damaging. This is not an intellectual conversation; it’s not a time for posturing. And it’s not OK that, in Gladwell’s book, I was treated and regarded as a case, as something locked in, and not as a person who is actively functioning and speaking and writing and prepared to provide my opinion.”

She says: “You have trolls, then you have this very sophisticated way [of writing]; it’s the same amount of damage, but disguised as this reasonable [critique]. It’s so easy for someone to copy and paste these sections from the transcript, to take my statement and analyse it however they may please, but it’s so difficult to live it. I’m not interested in making excuses any more. When a drunk man beats a woman, we don’t say: well the alcohol affected his decision-making. You’re accountable for that behaviour. It’s a crime.”

It’s infuriating how much victims have to sacrifice, how we have to speak in gruesome detail about private things

Over the past 18 months, Miller has been emboldened to speak out and ultimately shed her anonymity by the examples of the women testifying against Harvey Weinstein, and by Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. “I watched them literally sacrifice themselves for the greater good, with the single hope that it’s going to help someone. It’s infuriating when we see how much victims have to sacrifice and give away from themselves, and how much we have to speak in gruesome detail about things that feel very private, in order to make this apparent to people. How many times we’re caught in that cycle of saying: ‘Doesn’t this mean something to you? Why can’t you see me? Why doesn’t this hurt you? Why aren’t you alarmed?’ Each one has propelled me forward, and has cleared out a little more space in order for me to step out today. I think it would have been a much slower process for me coming to terms with going public had they not laid that groundwork.”

Does she think Kavanaugh should be impeached? Miller smiles. “I think a lot about that. Hmmm. I think when Christine Blasey Ford or Debbie Ramirez comes forward with their story, it is our job to create a space for them to speak the truth without being automatically converted into political punching bags. And, yes, I do think that people in power need to be held to a higher standard of behaviour. So many of these conversations feel so absurd.”

The point about gruesome detail is particularly relevant in Miller’s case; she writes about how it felt to discover, after the fact, that a huge closeup of her exposed genitals had been flashed before the court as part of the presentation of evidence, moments before she walked in to testify. To attach her name to that image; to invite people to imagine her being assaulted was grotesque and terrifying and, in the first instance, she says: “Anonymity was essential to self-preservation and processing.” She was also fearful for her safety. At every stage of the trial and its aftermath, she has received death and rape threats from random men set on defending Turner online.

Know My Name by Chanel Miller review – memoir of a sexual assault Read more

Over time, however, she began to think that the anonymity was cauterising her ability to heal. “When you keep something so contained, it restricts you from getting the help and support you need,” she says. “You’re keeping out the bad but the good comes in through that same door.” And what of shame? “Oh, of course. Shame loves growing in a contained environment, that’s the only way it can fester and thrive. You have to let your story breathe in order for some of that shame to be cleared out.”

The panic attacks have not gone away, and neither has the depression. She is still subject to bouts of anger and despair. At the end of the trial, Turner’s father read out a statement in which he said harsh punishment of his son would be “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20-plus years of life”. Those 20 minutes have cost Miller most of her 20s.

She tries to be gentle with herself, and to “accept this is going to dominate major chunks of my life”. She has also come to understand that what happens now “is not eternally out of my control. I’ve realised that each time I revisit this story, I’m changing. And I’m growing stronger, and becoming more clear-headed and assertive and articulate. So I’m not wasting time by returning to the story; that is my way of moving forward. Once I realised that, I could breathe a little easier.”

Besides which, she says: “There are no deadlines for healing. Ultimately this experience will always be a part of you, but you get to choose how it serves you; what you draw from it. I get to use my anger as fuel, I get to use my grief as strength, and my ability to empathise with anyone who’s going through this; I’m thankful for the ability to do that.”

The awful truth is that by the standards of most women who are raped or sexually assaulted, Miller’s has been a “good” experience; according to some analyses of Justice Department data, fewer than 1% of rapes in the US result in felony convictions. Turner was found guilty of sexual assault with intent to rape and, after a campaign online, the judge responsible for his light sentence was removed. Miller had sympathetic cops and a great district attorney. She was one of the lucky ones. To which she can only laugh and say, as women have been saying repeatedly for years: “If this is what’s considered a smooth trajectory through the system, it is my duty to report that it’s not working.”"

Imp. review – finding fascination in bloodshot fables,"Every Caryl Churchill play is an experiment with form. Her latest work comprises four pieces that get progressively longer as the evening continues. But, while each work has its own distinct identity, the unifying factor is the human need for myths, legends and stories and the imminence, as well as the immanence, of death. Together they make a strangely compelling quartet.

The last piece, Imp, is much the longest and a mix of the funny and macabre. It presents us with a couple of ageing cousins who live together in fractious harmony and whose sedate existence is governed by a dark secret. Jimmy is a depressive who finds solace in running and who recounts overheard stories that echo King Lear, Hamlet and Oedipus Rex.

Meanwhile the chair-bound Dot turns out to be a former nurse imprisoned for abusing a patient. Her real trust, however, resides in a bottle-imp that she treats with superstitious reverence. The power of the piece lies in its suggestion that even a life of studied ordinariness conceals untold mysteries and that nothing is quite what it seems.

But, in James Macdonald’s production, much of the attraction lies in the extraordinary performances. Deborah Findlay as Dot suggests a cosy aunt given to sudden murderous rages and unexpected recollections of sex. Toby Jones as Jimmy, full of nervously anxious smiles, has the air of an overgrown child and Tom Mothersdale and Louisa Harland look in to great effect as the old couple’s young victimised visitors.

The hunger for myths shadowed by murder also lies at the heart of Bluebeard’s Friends. In this the legendary wife-killer is treated as if he were a suburbanite about whom a quartet of friends and neighbours reminisce. One sees him as a classic psychopath: another casually remarks “he played the piano so beautifully”. Watching the play instantly reminds one of Hannah Arendt’s phrase about “the banality of evil” but the piece, expertly played by Findlay, Jones, Sarah Niles and Sule Rimi, confirms Churchill’s conviction that we are all haunted by a fascination with bloodshot fables.

The point is made even more strongly in Kill where Mothersdale, representing the gods and sitting atop a cloud, gives us a potted version of the Greek myths reminding us that western civilisation is founded on horrific stories of homicide, incest, cannibalism and cyclical revenge.

But possibly the strangest piece is the opening one in which a girl made of glass comes into collision with the all-too-real world of child abuse. Despite the heroine’s transparency, I found the piece somewhat opaque but that is my only criticism of an evening that is endlessly intriguing.

Miriam Buether’s design frames the four pieces inside a bulb-studded proscenium-arch and Macdonald’s agile production interweaves the plays with displays of juggling and acrobatics. But that seems highly appropriate for a work that is about theatre itself and about our eternal desire to be entertained by stories that combine the mythical, the mundane and the gory."

One that he had never wanted or expected to give.

The Incredible Sulk came out angry. Sulk shouty. Sulk guilty. There was no contrition. No humility. A normal person would have ’fessed up and resigned. But this was the speech of a serial offender – the narcissistic sociopath – who couldn’t believe he’d been caught red-handed yet again. “I done nothing,” sulked Sulk. He had been fitted up. The supreme court had got it wrong. Technically he was innocent. The electronic tag fitted by Lady Hale the previous day proved otherwise.

Lie followed lie. Lying is one of the only things Boris can be trusted to do. The prorogation had been perfectly normal. The Brexit negotiations were well advanced. Everything was going splendidly. The real problem wasn’t him. It was everyone else in Westminster. So give him an election and allow him to break his word on avoiding no deal.

Jeremy Corbyn wasn’t stupid enough to fall for Classic Dom’s last roll of the dice. But even so, his response was half-arsed. To put it kindly. The Labour leader had the prime minister on the ropes. The government’s credibility and integrity were in tatters but he could barely lay a punch. This was two washed-up drunks getting lairy in a pub at closing-time.

The Tory benches cheered. But the applause was laden with desperation. They know Johnson is a fraud. They know they’ve made a mistake. Worse, they know they are complicit. They and Johnson are parasitic, their survival dependent on the other. But what neither realises is that they are in a death spiral, draining each other’s lifeblood. The eyes are already dead, their bodies hollowed-out shells.

This wasn’t even their nadir. That came when Johnson said, “humbug” in response to Labour’s Paula Sherriff mentioning the death of Jo Cox. An insult compounded by him insisting the only way to honour her memory was to deliver his Brexit. As if the reward for getting his way was that women would not be murdered. It was one of the most shameful episodes the Commons has witnessed in years. If Tory MPs had an ounce of integrity and self-worth they would force him to resign within hours. If.

But they don’t. Many may subconsciously long for a no-confidence vote in The Sulk. Just to have the chance to do one thing in which they believe. But they will be denied. Their self-hatred will tear them apart. The punishment for their failure is their continued existence on life-support under the unforgiving gaze of parliament. And what’s left of their consciences.

The Commons had reconvened in the morning with a short – as in not as long as many had feared – statement from the Speaker welcoming MPs back to their place of work. Then the first act of the day’s drama got under way. It was just that no one had told the attorney general if he was appearing in a tragedy or a farce as he answered an urgent question on his legal advice to the government over prorogation.

Little more than a year ago, Geoffrey Cox had been just another MP with a crazy dream. But then he had won Westminster’s Got Talent – exclusively available on Hacker House TV, just dial 0800 and get a recorded message redirecting you to a woman in Florida – and had become its leading actor. The man with the golden voice. A shining beacon of intelligence in a cabinet of low voltage mediocrities. Today he blew it. A Star has Died.

Cox began by channelling his inner Ibsen in An Enemy of the People. The supreme court had ruled and the government would abide by its decision. The outcome hadn’t been as he and other members of the legal team had hoped and it was a matter of deep, deep personal regret that he found himself unable to disclose what his own advice had been.

“No one is suggesting for a moment that the supreme court has staged a constitutional coup,” he declared, happy to make a passive-aggressive attack on Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had done just that 24 hours previously. Just for the fun of it. Shares in the leader in the house have steadily tumbled since he’s been elevated to the cabinet. Rees-Mogg shuffled awkwardly on the frontbench. Where was nanny when you needed her?

So far, so good. But then Cox spoiled it all by insisting the government had at all times acted in good faith. Not even the dopiest Tory backbenchers believed that. As if trying to cover up this schoolboy error, Cox then went full-on space cadet. What followed was Brian Blessed appearing in a village hall farce, while out of his head on acid.

The arms started flailing and spit dribbled from his lips as the hallucinations became ever more intense. Then he went into spasms and rolled on the floor. The spiders, the spiders! They were everywhere, crawling up the walls. The hollow laughs of 11 Lady Hales echoed in his head. Parliament was a dead parliament. An ex-parliament with no moral right to sit. The government couldn’t govern. Several MPs gently tried to talk him down by explaining the reason it couldn’t govern was entirely the government’s own fault for shedding 21 of its own MPs.

No luck. One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small. And the ones that Boris give you don’t do anything at all. Parliament was just a waste of space. No one gave a shit about the domestic violence bill that could now be debated. Or about the Thomas Cook collapse. Hell, if you were poor enough to go on a package holiday then you deserved everything you got. Suckers. And why would anyone want to talk about Brexit?

A nurse came in to administer a vitamin C injection. Anything to help the comedown. But Cox was still ranting as he was escorted out the chamber. His dog, Lucy, put her paws over her eyes in shame. She’d told him to stick to a few joints. She’d got more sense out of him when he’d been down a K-hole in the recovery tent at Glastonbury. No wonder the government had lost in in the supreme court if he and Lord Keen were the best QCs on offer. Time to stockpile the dog food."

Jeremy Corbyn’s social media team could have recorded a video on any topic to mark the start of the Labour party conference: Brexit, the proposal to scrap Ofsted, or the plan to abolish prescription charges in England. Instead, they decided to show the Labour leader criticising The Andrew Marr Show for giving the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, an easy ride.

In a clip that attracted half a million views on Twitter, Corbyn explained his frustration that Raab had not been asked about the nature of Boris Johnson’s relationship with an American technology entrepreneur who accompanied him on trade trips.

“I was on the BBC’s flagship news programme this morning and I was asked about a range of issues,” he said. “That’s fine, it’s right, it’s justified, it’s how our democracy works. But I was followed by Boris Johnson’s deputy who was asked nothing about these allegations. This is how the establishment works. They close ranks.”

It was just one example of how Labour politicians at the party’s annual conference in Brighton were increasingly willing to directly confront traditional media outlets, and they did so in the strongest terms.

The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told activists he was preparing for the “full weight, the whole kitchen sink of the media, the Tory press, the gutter press thrown at us”, but said social media made newspapers “irrelevant”; Diane Abbott said the media, including the Guardian, had mistakenly written off Corbyn before and “may very well end up making yourselves look silly”; while Dawn Butler criticised the mainstream media for not covering the story about Johnson, though it first appeared on the front page of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sunday Times.

Some sceptics contend that these interventions are in bad faith: that senior party figures overemphasise problematic media coverage as part a strategy that owes more to Donald Trump than anyone in Labour would like to admit. They point out that saying that the media is refusing to cover a policy announcement almost always attracts more online readers than the original coverage, even when it exists.

But despite public warnings from some journalists about the risks of going to war with the press, Labour sources and former staffers suggest they have little choice in a genuinely hostile media environment, and say this approach is only set to ramp up as a general election looms, for three key reasons. First, that it is an effective way of energising core Labour supporters; second, that it highlights a real structural bias in the traditional media environment against leftwing politicians; and third, a conviction – seemingly backed by experience – that public criticism of news outlets on social media can push journalists and news outlets to change how they cover stories.

Matt Zarb-Cousin, who served as Corbyn’s spokesperson between 2016 and 2017, said Labour’s increased public criticism of the media is partly driven by necessity. “It’s inevitable that you’re going to get attacked,” he said. “So the only choice you’ve got is to frame that attack as vested interests trying to prevent changes to the status quo.”

BBC sources say that while they considered questioning Raab on the story during Marr’s BBC One show on Sunday, they only had a brief slot and decided to focus on the collapse of Thomas Cook and potential British involvement in Saudi Arabia’s conflict with Iran. The story was featured in the programme’s newspaper review, while BBC reporters travelling to the US with the prime minister were left to seek extra details.

Nonetheless, Corbyn’s clip helped Labour draw a dividing line. If an outlet was not covering this new scandal involving the prime minister, then they could also find themselves on the receiving end of a message from the opposition leader accusing them of being part of a cosy club – and a barrage of online criticism.

Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) There was something important in one of the Sunday papers today about an alleged abuse of power by Boris Johnson.



But do you know what? #Marr pic.twitter.com/XWPivbGL7e

Zarb-Cousin suggested the uneasy relationship the former Labour leader Ed Miliband had with rightwing newspapers – sometimes attempting to please the Sun, sometimes directly attacking the Daily Mail – was a legacy of the New Labour approach to media management where potential news coverage shaped party policy.

Instead, he claims, the Corbyn approach has been to prioritise policy and then call out media outlets which do not give the party fair coverage. “It can draw attention to something that hasn’t had much attention … If it’s a valid criticism, it’ll carry.”

News consumption habits are changing fast with younger viewers rapidly abandoning traditional outlets. There is also continued annoyance in Labour circles that TV and radio broadcasters – especially the BBC – still instinctively follow up stories pushed by print newspapers despite sales having halved in the last decade and given the Mirror and the Guardian are the only mainstream national titles offering a leftwing viewpoint.

“The BBC doesn’t tend to be overtly hostile to the centre left but its coverage tends to reflect the dominance of the newspapers,” said Tom Mills, a sociologist and vice-chair of the Corbyn-friendly Media Reform Coalition. He said that although some complaints from Labour supporters about journalists’ activities overstepped the mark, their “basic instinct that these institutions are hostile to the left is clear from the evidence”.

Individuals involved in planning Labour’s election campaign point to the surge in support the party enjoyed in 2017, when strict broadcasting impartiality rules kicked in. But there is an awareness that in other respects the party may find it harder to get its message across, especially given changes to the Facebook algorithm, which worked substantially in favour of Corbyn during the last general election by prioritising uncritical sites such as the Canary.

Instead, the party may need to allocate substantial sums to paid-for Facebook advertising in order to reach key voters.

Zarb-Cousin expects that just as social media influencers have become increasingly dominant in fashion and entertainment, the emphasis at the next election could shift towards the roles of influential pro-Corbyn figures on social media. “Obviously there’s going to be viral videos and Momentum content,” he said. “But I don’t think they’re going to be as impactful as the role of political influencers.”

Nancy Harris’s new play seizes on this to show the wives of the French and American presidents engaging in their own power battles during a summit conference and the result, over the course of 95 minutes, is provocatively amusing before descending into improbability.

The setting is the Cote d’Azur, where the US president has come to seek his French counterpart’s support for military strikes in retaliation for terrorist acts that have left a thousand dead. But Harris’s focus is on the excluded first ladies and she hasn’t strayed far from reality. Sophia, the American first lady, is a Croatian ex-model whom her rich, rightwing husband treats as a useful trophy. Helen, an English former journalist, is the wife of the French president and is significantly older than her husband, over whom she is said to exert undue influence.

So far, so familiar, and Harris gets plenty of mileage out of the frustrations of the two women. Aside from being shut out of the pivotal debates and unable to reach her husband, Helen complains that public banquets leave one permanently hungry. Sophia, who arrives spattered in blood after being attacked by protesters, is manipulated by a zealous press officer and claims that her husband “speaks to me only in front of other people”. Initially regarding each other with wary suspicion, the two women eventually bond and devise ways of radically overturning male power structures.

The play is persuasive up to a point. It falls apart only when the two women attempt to seize control. It is difficult to list the play’s implausibilities without revealing too much of the plot but a few points can be made. The geopolitical premise is unlikely: you wonder why, during a crisis, the US president seeks support from France rather than exploiting the “special relationship”. The two ladies, both of whom have been badly wronged, assume, too, that the world could be changed by an act of violence on their part.

That may be wishful thinking but it’s hard to see how it offers an alternative to global terrorism. It also ignores the fact that women such as Hillary Clinton and President François Hollande’s ex-partner Ségolène Royal have opted for the democratic path to power.

But, for all the play’s illogicalities, Nicholas Hytner’s production is pleasant to watch and boasts two strong performances. Zoë Wanamaker captures to perfection Helen’s bristling anger not just at her politically and sexually errant husband but at the patronising assumption that age, rather than intelligence, confers wisdom: as she ebulliently cries, “I could wipe the floor with the whole fucking lot of them.” Zrinka Cvitešić is equally good at convincing you of Sophia’s tormented past and desire to show the world that she is infinitely more than a glamorous presidential adornment. Lorna Brown as her press aide also stands up vigorously for female independence. But, while Harris’s play is passionately on the side of women who are not in the room where it happens, its suggestion that they should gain access by force is puzzlingly counterproductive."

As Boris Johnson prepared to give a speech at the UN in New York, judges in the UK supreme court produced a bombshell ruling. His decision to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament for five weeks was judged “unlawful, void and of no effect”, meaning parliament will resume business on Wednesday morning.

She said: “The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.”

Which element, I wondered, as girly swots will, was the greater insult? To be feminine (or effeminate) or a hard worker? Weak or an intellectual? Can you be the latter without being the former? Are we, in fact, in tautological realms? No – because to be a girly swot is different from (and worse than) being a plain swot. What has become clear to me is that, whatever the whys and wherefores of the phrase, the girly swots themselves – albeit of a slightly more proactive type than me – are coalescing into a force to be reckoned with.

The lineup looks like a Marvel comic strip waiting to happen. It would surely be led by Spider-Woman – Lady Brenda Hale. By day, a mild-mannered baroness. Also by day, the first female head of the supreme court and deliverer, when needed, of hammer blows to overreaching governments, prime ministers and their not-quite-as-machiavellian-as-they-thought advisers via unanimous verdicts that declare their attempts to hijack the national rule of law “unlawful, void and of no effect”. Flanking her are Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National party MP who brought the case in Scotland in favour of which Hale and co ruled, and Gina Miller, businesswoman (I like this as her superhero name, if we can’t fit Big Fan of Parliamentary Democracy on her cape) and campaigner who has now won two national-annals-worthy cases against the government. Then there is Greta Thunberg, who is speaking truth to an increasingly resentful power about the desperate state of the planet and confronting the need for radical overhauls of everything humanity has done, and is doing, to it. And, finally, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who is taking care of all other business, creative anarchy a speciality. Chosen weapons – books, intelligence, wit and memetastic brooches.

Perhaps the time of the girly swots is finally here for much the same reason as the world of culture is opening up to a greater degree for women. Just as the latter’s systems have become unsustainable in the wake of the Cosby, Weinstein and assorted other now-public scandals, so, too, are other areas falling as egomaniacal men push past even the very generous limits they have traditionally set themselves in the way of tolerable corruption, incompetence, self-indulgence and greed.

And, you know, girly swotitude will bear a range of meanings. It can be a broad church that shelters anyone – old, young, male, female and all points in between – who prefers to think before acting. Who doesn’t feel it is beneath them to consider a range of options or consult others they feel would know better about a particular subject or useful insights into a knotty problem. Who tends towards introversion rather than extroversion and lives quite happily without a overweening need to be noticed and who would prefer to leave things that aren’t broken unfixed. We’ve tried it the other way, and frankly it has not gone well. Girly swot team – assemble.

There is no sign of the country having made any progress towards getting one. Boris Johnson did not meet the 30-day deadline set by Angela Merkel to come up with an alternative solution to replace the Irish backstop to resolve the Brexit impasse with the European Union. This week he suffered a devastating judicial blow in the supreme court over an attempt to suspend parliament for an unprecedented five weeks at a time of political crisis to evade scrutiny. In a worrying sign of how far the Tory party has embraced radical populism, its MPs responded by calling for the court to be abolished. And instead of remorse Mr Johnson offered offence in parliament, couching his bluster in the jingoistic terms of “betrayal”, “surrender” and “sabotage”. Mr Johnson touched a new low by besmirching the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox.

Mr Johnson, like his predecessor Theresa May, describes Brexit as the will of the British people. It isn’t – not least because there was no shared vision as to what “leave” actually meant – but the language is designed to remove dissent, and any acknowledgment of diverse voices and views. The contraction of Brexit and the national interest has curdled and soured British politics. While the result deserves respect, almost half the country opposed it. During the referendum campaign Mr Johnson, a prominent leaver, did not engage in a deliberative, honest and respectful argument with opponents – a historic failure in light of the gravity of the decision. In office he has continued to offer insouciance and belligerence.

This must end. The nation will only be able to move on when the breach between leavers and remainers can be addressed in a calm and considered way. Mr Johnson had an opportunity to signal regret. He chose Trumpian attacks as dishonest as they were dangerous. If he had a shred of decency, he’d resign. Mr Johnson’s embrace of a hard Brexit might be explained because it offers a revolutionary way to a new social, political and economic order based on a weaker set of environmental, consumer and worker rights. Northern Ireland could pay a very high price for such a foolish move. So could the economy. The Bank of England estimates that the shock of a hard Brexit would see GDP decline by about 5.5%, an economic shock comparable to the 2008 financial crash. Then the UK economy took five years to get back to the size it was before the recession – and wages have yet to recover in real terms for the average worker.

In his book Beyond Brexit, Vernon Bogdanor warns that in leaving the EU, Britain could again become a country with no legal remedy for breaches of human rights. At present, when courts make a declaration of incompatibility between convention rights and British law, ministers act to put things right. That might not be the case in the years ahead. We could become a “paradise for an overweening executive”. Brexit populism is pouring arsenic into the water supply of our national conversation. Brexit raised questions that it cannot answer because it identified problems that politicians did not recognise and were unprepared to solve. They should start. Only dullness in parliamentary government can heal the divisions."

Like Abraham Lincoln’s revered speech, which ran to 273 words, Thunberg’s was also very short, only 495 words long.

Lincoln famously spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery, following the leading orator of the day, Edward Everett, who took two hours to deliver the official address, a 13,000 word oration. Lincoln’s speech, simply described in the day’s official program as Dedicatory Remarks, lasted less than three minutes.

Greta Thunberg showed the world what it means to lead | Michael H Fuchs Read more

Thunberg would similarly have had some good acts to follow at a UN talk-fest, but her presence would not, at first glance, seem to be of the same significance as those of the various world leaders who had gathered for the event.

And yet it is Thunberg’s speech, which took just four-and-a-half minutes to deliver, which, one suspects, will resonate long into the future.

In the manner that was then traditional, Everett’s marathon speech, deemed very good by the standards of the day, was rich with classical allusion. But Lincoln used no classical reference. Instead, in a way that it is hard to appreciate from this distance of time, he was profoundly modern, using Biblical phrasing and rhythms that appealed to a population for whom the Book was the word, not Sophocles.

Thunberg’s speech was similarly phrased in the contemporary argot pitched to the polarising force of social media’s algorithms, suffused with a contained rage. For she came not with a dream, but a nightmare, the scientific truth of climate change succinctly put in five paragraphs. Her dreams, she said, had been stolen from her along with her childhood.

Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing?

Thunberg’s speech was damned by many, a Fox News commentator responding to the speech by calling Thunberg “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left”. So too Lincoln, the London Times in 1863 not so very distant from Fox News in 2019, when, echoing some US newspapers, opined : “The ceremony [at Gettysburg] was rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.”

Thunberg’s speech used phrases and ideas she has deployed before and to better effect. So too Lincoln. But what gives both speeches their enormous power is timing, each coming after historic events the significance of which had not yet been fully understood and was still in the process of creation.

In Lincoln’s case it was the Battle of Gettysburg that had taken place a few months earlier, now regarded as a turning point in the civil war. In Thunberg’s case it was the massive global strike of schoolchildren a few days earlier inspired by her original, solitary strike on the steps of the Swedish parliament.

Lincoln’s speech sought to give meaning to the enormous blood sacrifice of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the war more generally; in doing so he was shaping the future of the war and his nation.

Thunberg’s singular achievement was to present the climate change issue as a battle for power. In doing so she spoke with the authority of the millions who marched only a few days before. For this Donald Trump trolled her. He intuited her power and tried to destroy it through mockery.

In her speech Thunberg sets up an opposition between the plural we – those who want action on climate change – and a strangely singular use of the word you – those who don’t.

And though she was speaking to an audience largely composed of those with power, her you was not only the assembled global leaders but everyone, and her we, while directly referring to the young and Friday’s three million marchers, was a we open to all, infinitely expandable.

For the you is not just Trump or Scott Morrison or a fossil fuel company executive. Her you is personal. It is each of us who hears but as if in a nightmare cannot act. Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing, condemning yourself to the ranks of those who the future “will never forgive”?

Morrison responds to Greta Thunberg by warning children against 'needless' climate anxiety Read more

On Wednesday the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the nation’s creepy gaslighter-in-chief, criticised Thunberg for similar reasons to Trump, saying, “I think we’ve got to caution against raising the anxieties of children in our country.”

Since 1996 – seven years before Greta Thunberg was born – the Liberal party has been working assiduously to advance the cause of fossil fuel companies at the expense of our future. Morrison’s paternalistic piffle is just one more piece of grotesque bad faith on an issue about which the Liberal record is one of lying, scheming and wrecking at every step for over two decades. With his bluster of quiet Australians, Morrison is trying to pull a spit hood over the nation to silence us all.

Recently released Australian cabinet papers reveal the Howard Liberal government was conspicuously campaigning in 1996 against legally binding, uniform emission reduction targets in the Kyoto protocol, with the prime minister’s advocacy to key world leaders proving “influential”. When uniform targets were eventually dropped, the Liberal cabinet praised John Howard’s negotiating strategy.

If the world continues on its trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years

“Australia is in a special position,” the cabinet papers record Howard saying. “We are a developed country that is a major exporter of energy.”

And so it went for the next two decades. With the Liberals and the Murdoch press running political cover, the fossil fuel industries ramped up and up. By 2019 the Liberal party had defined itself as the party of coal, and a craven Labor party, after its defeat in the most recent election, is now following its lead. Today Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and LNG, and over the next decade Australia hopes to double its coal production. In consequence Australia is well on the way to becoming a pariah state along with the likes of Russia and Saudi Arabia, its people hostage to the profits of its fossil fuel industry.

The gross corruption of Australian public life so recently on display with examples of large sums of money from the Chinese Communist party seeming to flow into both Liberal and Labor coffers show exactly how easily purchased an enfeebled and unresponsive Australian democracy has become. And the corollary, the shameful, shared refusal of both Labor and Liberal parties to back a much-needed national corruption commission suggests only the obvious: the depth and breadth of corruption of our national polity.

And yet while avoiding the criminality among their own, our leaders have been keen to criminalise those who actively campaign for our future. Queensland – the epicentre for major new coalmines – has significantly strengthened its laws against environmental protesters while lawyers for the Adani mine have publicly stated that they will seek to bankrupt any opponents of their new coalmine, the most controversial in the world, commercially viable only with the subsidies and tax breaks given for its consumption by the Indian government and for its production by Australian governments.

When Morrison infamously brandished a lump of coal in parliament he told Australians not to be scared.

But we should be.

Australia is already living the grim consequences of climate change. If the world continues on its present trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years. The climate collapse is here.

For over 30 years those who wished for action on climate change have believed that reason and truth would persuade those with power to act. But it is not so, and it did not prove to be so, and therein lies much of the reason carbon levels continue to rise and the planet’s very future is today hanging by the thinnest of threads.

For power never gives to reason. Power bends only to power. And on Monday a schoolgirl raised the spectre of an opposing power that is now rising around the world and which will not be satisfied by those “who can only talk about money and fairytales of eternal economic growth”.

“The young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you … We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”

Watching Greta Thunberg’s speech I understood what last Friday was about: a historic turning point where for the first time the power of we met the power of you without artifice, without compromise and with a ferocious courage.

Millions marched last Friday. The next march will be bigger. The battle lines are finally clear. And each of us must now decide: am I you or am I we?"

They want equality | Amjad Iraqi,"In my hometown of Tira, an Arab community in central Israel, word spread on election day last week of many residents deciding to vote at the last minute. During the campaign’s final weeks, families watched as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu launched ferocious tirades about the threat of a “leftist-Arab government”. He told his followers the Arabs “want to annihilate us all”, and that they were “stealing” the elections through rampant voter fraud (his legislative attempts to place surveillance cameras at Arab polling stations failed to get through the Knesset).

Tira’s residents were no strangers to the prime minister’s history of racist incitement, but for many people his shocking escalations compelled a response. If they couldn’t stop him from winning, they thought, they would at least try to make his job as difficult as possible.

So far, they have succeeded. About 60% of eligible Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up a fifth of the state’s population, cast their ballots last week – a leap from 49% in the April elections, which failed to produce a governing coalition. The Joint List, a reunified alliance of four Arab-led political parties, restored its place as the third largest slate in the Knesset with 13 seats, aided in great part by its intensive campaign to regain public support. Opposition Jewish parties also received small shares of the Palestinian vote.

Like much of Israeli politics over the past decade, the value placed on Palestinian voting power has been centred almost exclusively on one issue: ousting Netanyahu

Traditionally, Arab parties have refused to nominate an Israeli prime minister – their last recommendation was for Yitzhak Rabin in 1992, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization. But in a historic and controversial move on Sunday, Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, formally recommended to President Reuven Rivlin that Benny Gantz, leader of the centre-right Blue and White party, be appointed to form the next government. Only one of the List’s factions, the nationalist party Balad, withheld its support. Had Odeh declined to nominate Gantz, the task was more likely to be assigned to Netanyahu again. (At Rivlin’s urging, the two leaders have now begun talks about forming a unity government.)

These surprising developments have been praised as major steps towards “integrating” Palestinian citizens into national politics and reigniting the opposition to increasingly hard-right rule. But such claims are seriously flawed. Like much of Israeli politics over the past decade, the value placed on Palestinian voting power has been centred almost exclusively on one issue: ousting Netanyahu. There has been little engagement in Israel or abroad with the community’s larger policy concerns, which include stopping home demolitions and land seizures, eradicating gun violence in Arab towns, revoking dozens of discriminatory laws and ending the occupation of the Palestinian territories. And yet as the Palestinian writer and feminist activist Samah Salaime put it, the Israeli centre-left now thinks that it is the responsibility of Palestinians “to take Bibi down – as second-class citizens, but first-class voters”.

This narrow narrative, which the Joint List itself often resorts to, reduces Palestinian citizens to pawns in a competition between Jewish political elites, whose differences have more to do with personality than policy. It’s not just that Blue and White’s platform mirrors Likud in nearly all but name: Gantz and his partner, Yair Lapid, have repeatedly derided the Joint List as extremists who don’t represent their constituents, and have rejected the conditions put forward by Odeh for backing Gantz’s candidacy – conditions ranging from recognising dozens of Bedouin villages in the Negev to cancelling the Jewish nation-state law, which reflect the basic needs and rights of Palestinian citizens. “Centre-left” Zionist parties, such as the Democratic Union and Labour-Gesher, have also shifted rightwards in many of their positions: the two-state solution, once the centre-left’s flagship agenda, is no longer a priority.

Given this divide, Arab parties usually prefer to stay out of the Jewish majority’s leadership battles. But with today’s competing blocs neck-and-neck, with Palestinian national politics severely fragmented and with Palestinian citizens demanding results from their infighting leaders, the Joint List found itself between a rock and a hard place.

Removing Netanyahu and disrupting the rightwing’s decade-long hold on power could provide many strategic benefits to Palestinian citizens – a path that appears to be endorsed by most of the community, who are feeling the brunt of the government’s increasingly harmful policies. But to do this, they must back Gantz, a former army chief who boasted of bombing Gaza “back to the stone age”, and who declared that he would only sit with coalition partners who were “Jewish and Zionist” – echoing the racist politics of the very rival he is trying to depose. Palestinians are damned if the List steps away and allows Netanyahu’s return, and they are damned if it steps in and offers Gantz a path to power.

We must talk about Palestine – without being antisemitic | Layla Moran Read more

By opting for the latter, the List has taken a gamble that is already polarising Palestinian opinion, and which could backfire devastatingly if a unity government is formed. Regardless of what unfolds, the obsession with Netanyahu’s fate must shift to the bigger problem at the heart of Israeli politics. Despite differing ideologies, Palestinian citizens remain united around a core political consensus: full equality and social justice for all, and an end to the military occupation. These pillars – which would be basic values in any other part of the world – are still viewed by most Jewish-Israeli parties and voters as uncomfortable at best and an existential threat at worst. That makes the Joint List, despite its numerous flaws, the only truly progressive party in Israel.

But as long as Israel’s “democracy” is predicated on accepting racial primacy and disenfranchising millions, it won’t matter how many parliamentary seats the List can muster – its “first-class voters” will remain second-class citizens.

In order to maintain their profits, the companies that had developed effective medicines fought hard to prevent the sale of affordable generics. So while those with the condition in the US and Europe were getting lifesaving treatment, only a handful of the millions across Africa who needed it had access.

Fast-forward to 2019, and campaigning has resulted in HIV treatment prices dropping from tens of thousands of pounds a year for each patient to about £50, and millions of people across the global south are alive today thanks to cheap, quality-assured generic medicines. But the problem at the heart of the current model of pharmaceutical innovation has not gone away. It is endangering the lives of patients in the UK and threatening the sustainability of health systems across the rich and poor worlds.

At the moment, innovation is incentivised by the profits drug companies can expect to make during the 20-year monopolies they are granted through patents on the medicines they develop. During that time, they are free to charge whatever price they like, allowing them to recoup their costs, provide funds for future innovation and make a return for shareholders.

That’s the theory. In reality this model is coming in for growing criticism. Too often the medicines that we need the most are not the ones that generate the most profit, so we’re left with little or no private investment in new antibiotics or treatments for diseases affecting the world’s poor. When we do get new medicines, the prices charged increasingly mean the people and health systems that need them cannot afford them, while companies use more of their revenue to buy back their own shares and market their products than they invest in new research. What’s more, the very substantial public funding that underpins the development of most new medicines is forgotten when the most profitable industry in the world sells those innovations back to us.

Labour has an alternative plan. The policy paper it presented at its conference in Brighton, titled Medicines for the Many, sets out the breadth of the dysfunctionality of the current system and proposes a bold set of reforms. It commits the party to using existing but underutilised legal powers to suspend drug companies’ monopolies if they refuse to offer the NHS a fair price. And the party has pledged to apply affordability conditions to the funding the UK government provides for medical research.

The most headline-grabbing commitment was the plan to establish a publicly owned pharmaceutical company able to supply low-cost medicines to the NHS. But the most far-reaching reform – to be explored through feasibility studies and pilots at first – is the introduction of an entirely new innovation incentive model. Known as “delinkage”, it comprises a suite of prize funds and grants that would allow the public to steer research priorities, rewarding the innovation we truly need while keeping drug prices low through generic competition.

These aren’t abstract debates. For the last four years, patients with cystic fibrosis have been fighting to get access to a treatment called Orkambi, which can transform the lives of those living with the condition. It is one of a new class of medicines that address the underlying causes of cystic fibrosis, not just the symptoms. But the US company that holds the patent, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is seeking £105,000 a patient a year. The NHS has said that’s too much, and its record offer of £500m over five years has been rejected.

For Luis Walker, a nine-year-old boy from Sussex, this has daily consequences. His cystic fibrosis causes a buildup of mucus on his lungs, requiring daily physio and nebuliser routines that take four hours, causing regular hospital admissions. Luis has been campaigning for years with his mum and thousands of other patients to get access to Orkambi – pleading for a deal that could change his life.

Simply paying the high price the company is demanding would siphon off valuable resources the underfunded NHS needs and sends a dangerous message to drug companies that holding out for more is a winning strategy. In the face of campaign pressure, the government has accepted its “moral obligation” to explore providing access to the generic version of Orkambi. But it has not acted yet, and the problems we face are much bigger than one medicine – we need a systemic solution.

For the sake of Luis and people like him, I hope Labour delivers on its commitments, and that other parties accept what governments across the world are beginning to recognise – that the status quo is unsustainable and has to change.

A four-day turnaround including a hasty flight south, on the other hand, have allowed precious little time for reflection on the Tonga game and England’s plan for the USA Eagles was preordained a while ago. The objective is simple: get the job done as simply and effectively as possible before moving on to the crunchier fixtures in Tokyo which will determine the final pecking order in Pool C. While they pride themselves on their world-class beef hereabouts, Eddie Jones’s side do not want to make a meal of this particular contest.

It could well prove more awkward than some are envisaging. In past tournaments it has generally been the lower-ranked nations who have been required to back up within 96 hours of a bruising Test. This time it is the Eagles who have been enjoying the luxury of uninterrupted preparation on the island of Okinawa while England have been playing and shaking out their suitcases. A similar schedule clearly did not help Fiji against Uruguay, mentally or physically. When Gary Gold, the USA head coach, talked up Jones’s squad as having no apparent weaknesses he slyly omitted to mention he and his Eagles have been targeting this game for months.

Much work has gone in to improving their set-piece and they will be equally keen to test England physically and via their tactical kicking.

Get ahead and there are few more committed sides in terms of putting bodies on the line. England’s challenge – which partly explains the starting XV Jones has named – will involve making the most of any ball kicked their way, utilising their pace out wide and retaining possession rather better than they did against the Tongans. “The one area we really want to impress with is our attack and keeping hold of the ball,” said Joe Launchbury, one of 13 players in the matchday 23 not involved in Sapporo. Over their midweek team lunch largely consisting of the aforementioned Kobe beef, however, it might have been worth someone raising the subject of the 2007 version of this fixture in Lens when England made desperately heavy weather of beating a spirited American side and lost their then‑captain, Phil Vickery, for their big pool game against South Africa after he was banned for a trip on the Eagles centre Paul Emerick.

For Jones to lose a key player or two to a similarly out-of-the-blue incident or injury would be untimely to say the least. Nor does he want to see those currently not perceived as first-choice starters trying to throw miracle passes or veering “off script” in a bid to further their individual chances of selection against the Pumas. The USA may be ranked 13th in the world, below Georgia, but they could pose their opponents more scoreboard problems than Tonga, ranked 15th, ultimately did in Sunday’s 35-3 contest.

Gold also knows this stadium well, having coached the local Kobelco Steelers. Kobe is home to a huge port and is Japan’s leading sake-producing region, a combination which may help to explain why its residents love their rugby so much. For seven years in a row between 1989 and 1995 their team won the Top 14 title, inspired by Japan’s so-called “Mr Rugby”, Seiji Hirao, who attended Oxford University, played in three World Cup tournaments and also coached the national side.

Hirao died of cancer aged 53 in 2016 but his legacy lives on in Kobe. “It has always been a place where rugby is the predominant sport, which is not the case in most cities in Japan,” said Jones. “There are bars around the town which are dedicated to rugby which is unusual here. Most of the fans are rugby fans, not football fans or baseball fans, so it stands out in that way.”

Rugby, furthermore, played its part in rebuilding morale following the 1995 Kobe earthquake which killed almost 6,500 people but Jones’s most abiding sporting memory was a match his Japan side played here in the autumn of 2014. “We had two games against the Maori All Blacks and when we played them here we were beaten by 60 points. We didn’t deliberately go out to get beaten but we deliberately played away from our strengths to send a message to the team about how we were going to play. The next game we played, we got beaten by one point. It reinforced the point we had to play to our strengths.”

Jones, apparently, has since attempted something similar as England’s coach, with similar results. “How did it go? Not well. It doesn’t usually go well when you don’t play to your strengths, but it can be a great education for the team.” Soon enough, though, the time for experimentation and tinkering will be over. With Jack Nowell and Henry Slade seemingly on the mend, competition for places is about to intensify further from next week onwards. This is not the moment for England’s midweekers to take their eyes off the ball."

Yet the result should not mask the latest worrying display, one that followed Saturday’s defeat at West Ham, as they were taken to spot-kicks by a 16-year-old right-back named Luke Matheson. He will long remember his 76th-minute equaliser and sprint to celebrate in front of the Rochdale fans he had sent into ecstasy.

Manchester United beat Rochdale on pens, Oxford 4-0 West Ham: Carabao Cup – live! Read more

Matheson, an A-level student, will be 17 next week but it was United’s own 17-year-old, Mason Greenwood, whose earlier strike appeared to have won the tie. United then drew Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the next round and the manager said: “If you want to win it you have to beat the best.”

Solskjær had retained only Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Andreas Pereira from the West Ham loss. The headline inclusion was Axel Tuanzebe who, at 21, captained United in only a 10th appearance. He was the youngest to do so since a 20-year-old Norman Whiteside in 1985. This was despite Paul Pogba’s first start for close to a month because of injury.

Brian Barry-Murphy’s side are 17th in League One, six points above the relegation zone after nine games, yet reached the break on level terms.

Of particular interest was how Greenwood would perform in his first game as United’s No 9 – and he impressed. He would have had a first clear chance if Pogba had turned a far-post header to him. Moments later, he was put in along the left by the same player but his control faltered.

United seemed to be moving closer to the breakthrough: Greenwood crossed the ball in from the right, yet Pogba’s header was a particularly woeful miss. Possession was largely United’s but they lacked the class and composure to make it count.

There was then a real scare for the United defence: it could do nothing as Ollie Rathbone – once of United – found Callum Camps and suddenly Wan-Bissaka had to clear off the line.

This had the packed away end delirious and the home support wondering what, precisely, their team was doing. Rochdale could start to believe the upset was on.

Greenwood was United’s brightest player, as he continued to pop up in and around Robert Sánchez’s goal.

The sign of United’s desperate times came on the hour when Solskjær replaced the toothless Tahith Chong for James, whose impact was instant, laying off a pass to Greenwood whose shot forced Sánchez to concede a corner.

Then United had the breakthrough and Brandon Williams, on his debut aged 19, was instrumental. He found Pereira, who relayed the ball to Jesse Lingard: Greenwood took over, and it was 1-0. Yet now came the twist as Matheson raced in from the right and buried a finish past Sergio Romero and penalties beckoned.

Rathbone finished disappointed but proud. “It was amazing We were expecting to get drummed here. We did really well,” he said. Solskjær added: “You know we’re better in penalty shootouts than in proper games.” He was joking yet some fans may be worried that such a jest is now true of their team."

The League One side scored four unanswered goals via Elliott Moore, Matty Taylor, Tariqe Fosu and the excellent Shandon Baptiste to progress into the fourth round for the first time in 22 years.

West Ham had made nine changes after the 2-0 win at home to Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday and Pellegrini said: “The whole team didn’t play well.

Daniel James gives nervy Manchester United shootout win against Rochdale Read more

“Not only did we concede four goals, but we didn’t create too many chances. We missed too many passes from the beginning and the responsibility is first on me because I picked the players and second of course on the team that didn’t compete.

“We talked enough with all of them to understand that the competition was different, the team was different and to play now against Oxford, who were in a good moment after winning 6-0 [at Lincoln] in their last game.

“The players must understand, but I repeat we couldn’t do it because in front was a team that played very well. I don’t want to take anything away from Oxford because they played very well.”

Only Issa Diop and Pablo Fornals retained their starting berths from the win over United, but Pellegrini introduced Felipe Anderson and Sébastien Haller off the bench early in the second half. He defended his team selection here, insisting it was a necessity because of their fixture schedule.

He said: “I think in England if you want to play in all the competitions you need to use your whole squad. You cannot just continue with the same players that play on Saturday.”

West Ham supporters were making plenty of noise during the opening exchanges, including mocking their London rivals Tottenham, who were dumped out of the competition on penalties at Colchester on Tuesday. But Oxford delivered a brutal shock to send another Premier League side out.

Pellegrini’s counterpart, Karl Robinson, was delighted with his players and urged the 9,000 home supporters to turn up again for Saturday’s league fixture with Gillingham. “We had the belief in ourselves that we could get a result,” he said.

“I’m over the moon for the fans and the players. It’s about the players, about the fans and about the community of Oxfordshire and the big thing for me now is the people who came here for the first time in a long time, that they buy a ticket and come on Saturday. We want them to support us moving forward because economical growth is important for what we are trying to achieve.”

Robinson, who masterminded a 4-0 win against Manchester United five years ago as MK Dons manager, admitted the result was one of Oxford’s best at home in recent years, surpassing their FA Cup wins against Newcastle and Swansea.

“Looking at the scoreboard, 4-0 against West Ham and a very strong West Ham, this will probably go down as one of the biggest results at the Kassam in recent years.”

Robinson’s side quickly got back into their stride after the substitution and hit the crossbar with when Hall’s free kick almost crept in.

West Ham responded with the lively Holland testing Simon Eastwood from a tight angle on the left before Moore cleared the loose ball. Jack Wilshere tried his luck from range in the 32nd minute, yet it was a comfortable for the U’s goalkeeper.

Robert Snodgrass was denied a shot on goal by Rob Dickie early in the second period before the hosts’ confidence increased again when Roberto sliced a clearance behind for a corner.

West Ham survived that set piece and the next, but Robinson’s team kept the ball alive and Mark Sykes crossed in for Moore, who controlled and fired into the bottom corner from eight yards. shock was firmly on the cards and Sykes was giving Arthur Masuaku plenty of problems and almost created a second for Oxford two minutes later when Mackie flicked goalwards, but Roberto produced a brilliant stop to save the Hammers. It was one-way traffic, with the U’s eager for a second and Pellegrini reacted by introducing Sebastien Haller and Felipe Anderson, but it failed to have the desired effect.

Oxford increased their lead with 19 minutes left. Sykes was allowed too much space on the right and he crossed in for Taylor to tap home at the back post. Fosu, fresh from a hat-trick at Lincoln on Saturday, then slipped past Arthur Masuaku, rounded Roberto and slotted home. In added time Baptiste side-footed into the bottom corner to send Oxford into the fourth round, and with it a home tie against Sunderland, for the first time since 1997."

James Milner opened the scoring for the visitors before helping to double Liverpool’s lead by creating a goal for a player nearly half his age, 17-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever.

The visit of the Premier League leaders attracted a record home crowd for an MK Dons match, an attendance of nearly 29,000 representing an increase of more than 300% on the turn-out for their last match here, the 1-0 defeat against Southend on Saturday. So chants of “You’re only here to see the European champions” would hardly have been misplaced, except that none of the players who started last season’s Champions League final made the trip to Buckinghamshire. Instead, and notwithstanding the presence of six distinguished senior players, this was more like a preview of Liverpool’s future, with five of the club’s most exciting youngsters given their first starts.

Oxford United humiliate West Ham in shock Carabao Cup thrashing Read more

Never had a player as young as Harvey Elliott – age 16 years and 174 days – begun a competitive match for Liverpool’s senior team. Here the prodigy made his first appearance since joining in the summer from Fulham, with whom he made history last season by becoming the youngest player to feature for anyone in this competition. He shone here and could have scored but twice struck shots against the crossbar.

Elliott was the most eye-catching of the teenagers in Liverpool’s front three, but 18-year-old Curtis Jones also impressed, while 19-year-old Rhian Brewster made less of an impact even if his movement hinted at the potential that he is known to have. Jürgen Klopp was eager to praise another of the debutants, 20-year-old Caoimhín Kelleher, who made an excellent late save to deny Jordan Bowery.

MK Dons, with six changes from the Southend defeat, were determined to be more than supporting cast members in the Liverpool roadshow. They nearly stole the limelight with a nice attack in the 11th minute, which ended with Conor McGrandles whacking a shot just over the bar from 12 yards. Then Liverpool took centre stage. Milner danced forward from left-back to smash a low pass across the face of goal. This looked like being Elliott’s moment to announce himself but he slammed his shot against the bar from six yards.

Undeterred, Elliott continued to down the right with skill, enterprise and an artful left foot. With one marvellous piece of play in the 26th minute he invited Milner to score but the veteran sent a plunging header inches wide.

Eventually Milner made the breakthrough thanks to a large helping of luck. When a poor clearance fell to him just at the edge of the area, his shot seemed little more than a token gesture until Stuart Moore fumbled it over the line.

The hosts tried to fight back but landed no blows, Bowery going closest with a shot off the outside of the post. Hoever soon settled matters for Liverpool with a wonderful goal. Milner created it by hanging up a cross to the back post, where the 17-year-old leapt between George Williams and Joe Walsh to head superbly into the net.

Kelleher still had to make a fine save to foil Bowery after that. Klopp attributed Liverpool’s raggedness towards the end to inexperience. “The team had a lack of rhythm and experience,” he said. “The player with the most experience and rhythm was the best on the pitch [Milner]. But it’s so important we have these games and are brave enough to use the young boys. They have to feel these situations.”

Despite a bit of late panic, Liverpool went close to making it 3-0, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hitting the post from long-range before Elliott curled another effort against the bar. So the 16-year-old did not get on the scoresheet but sure made an impression on his boss. “He will always be a special player for moments but his overall performance, including defence, was very good,” said Klopp."

It was a fine way for the 18-year-old to celebrate his new five-year deal and the latest in a growing list of reasons for Frank Lampard to give thanks to Chelsea’s flourishing academy.

MK Dons v Liverpool, Manchester United v Rochdale: Carabao Cup – live! Read more

There were plenty of positives as Lampard collected his first home win as Chelsea manager. Chelsea had six youth players on the pitch and four more on the bench by the end of this 7-1 romp, with Ian Maatsen and Tino Anjorin coming on their debuts midway through the second half. Billy Gilmour, bright and inventive in midfield, caught the eye on his first start. Marc Guehi, only 19, belied his tender years with an assured debut in central defence. And Reece James, the youngster tipped to take César Azpilicueta’s place at right-back one day, introduced himself to the first team with a lovely goal, curling in a precise shot from 25 yards with eight minutes left.

But Lampard, whose side host Manchester United in the fourth round, wants more. He was unhappy that Chelsea missed a chance to keep their first clean sheet of the season and his analysis even included criticism of Hudson-Odoi’s performance in the first half. Lampard said that the left winger, grasping for sharpness on his return from a serious achilles injury, had ignored instructions to run behind Grimsby’s defence. Strong words were required in the dressing room at half-time.

Yet Hudson-Odoi grew into the game in the second half, as did Christian Pulisic on the opposite flank, and Lampard would also heap generous praise on his youngsters. “The two young lads improved the team when they came on,” Chelsea’s manager said.

“Billy Gilmour ran the game from midfield. Marc Guehi was solid. The opportunities are there but now the hard work really begins to get in there regularly.”

Amid the focus on the kids there was also encouragement for some of Lampard’s more experienced players. Four minutes had passed when Ross Barkley fizzed a low drive inside McKeown’s near post. The hosts built on Barkley’s first goal of the season three minutes later, a deflected cross from James reaching Michy Batshuayi, who grabbed his first goal for Chelsea since January 2018 with a sharp finish.

However the League Two side halved the deficit in the 19th minute, exposing Chelsea’s defensive frailties when Kurt Zouma allowed a long punt to squeeze through to Matt Green, whose venomous shot sent the noisy travelling contingent wild.

Lampard called Grimsby’s goal a disaster but Chelsea continued to dominate, earning a penalty when Green fouled Zouma. This time, however, spot-kick duties did not fall to Barkley, who missed from 12 yards against Valencia last week. Pedro stepped up to send McKeown the wrong way. “The good thing in my job is I can choose who does things and I chose Pedro to be captain and take a penalty tonight,” Lampard said.

A fourth goal arrived when James conjured a brilliant assist, jabbing a cross into the six-yard box with the outside of his right boot. Zouma prodded in from close range.

James looked the part after returning from an ankle injury. “Reece’s performances last year at Wigan, in the team of the year in the Championship, showed the talent he’s got,” Lampard said. “He’s got a great player and person to look up to in Azpilicueta. It’s just the start for Reece.” The best was yet to come from the 19-year-old, who made it 5-1 in the 82nd minute. Pulisic also became more of an influence, creating Batshuayi’s second, and there was still time for Hudson-Odoi, twisting and turning on the left, to round off a comprehensive win."

I’m damaged’,"Britain’s pioneering former fighter and five-time world champion, who won a landmark case for women in 1998, is rediscovering her lust for life after enduring a torrid time in the sport

“I just think I’m damaged, like really damaged,” Jane Couch says quietly as the tears roll down her face. She hunches over and her body shakes. This is the painful cost of being the pioneer of women’s boxing in Britain. Couch was the five-time world champion boxer who was barred from fighting in her own country. Just over 20 years ago the British Boxing Board of Control still insisted women were too emotionally unstable to box.

On my way to meet Couch I hear that Katie Taylor, the brilliant Irish boxer, will headline a bill at the Manchester Arena on 2 November with Anthony Crolla, a former world champion and much-loved Mancunian, on her undercard. Without Couch’s courage and defiance, Taylor would not be in this position.

The boxing dentist: a fighter who breaks and remakes teeth for a living Read more

Couch had to win a court case against the sport’s governing body to make British sporting history in August 1998. Bernard Buckley, the board’s solicitor, built his case on the claim that “many women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.”

But Couch had shown her mettle to win her first world title in only her fifth fight in 1996. She had flown to Denmark to face Sandra Geiger, the French world champion who came from a kickboxing background. Couch suffered a broken jaw, shattered cheekbone, fractured eye-socket, cracked ribs and a missing tooth but she still won a unanimous decision over 10 rounds. She and Geiger both ended up in hospital.

Her world titles and landmark legal victory were of little benefit to Couch. She still struggled to get fights and there were many times when she travelled abroad and, after brutal bouts, was not even paid. At home Couch was shunned by boxing promoters and mocked on television and in the tabloids.

If I had known what it would cost me I probably wouldn’t have done it. I gave up everything. I didn’t even get into a proper relationship until I was 41

I have known Couch since the late 1990s, when I first interviewed her, and she is one of the most admirable and kindest people I’ve met in boxing. She retired 10 years ago but today, as she relives the past trauma, her usual laughter is replaced by grief. When we take a break, because it is so upsetting for her, Couch says simply: “I wish I hadn’t been the first. I wish I hadn’t gone through all that shit.”

Couch nods when I ask if it’s OK to continue. “I want to,” she says. “But if I had known what it would cost me I probably wouldn’t have done it. I gave up everything. I didn’t even get into a proper relationship until I was 41. I was my own worst enemy because I’d just argue with [promoters] Frank Maloney and Frank Warren. I’d be like: ‘I’m not frightened of you. Fuck the pair of you. I’ll fight in France, Germany or America.’”

The 51-year-old Couch looks up when I say her scars seem more like wounds. “I’m damaged,” she says again. “I didn’t think I was but the counsellors and doctors encourage you to talk. They say: ‘It’s good to get it out. If you hold it in, Jane, you’ll only do more damage.’”

She wipes her eyes and apologises for crying. Yet her tears are a sign of strength. They show her candour and fight. “I hope so. I just find it hard. It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don’t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they’d call me a lesbian or a freak.”

At the heart of Couch’s engaging new book, The Final Round, she details the legal battle she waged against the boxing board which peddled views of women more suited to the 1890s than the 1990s. Her victory changed sport in this country but Couch shakes her head. “Don’t credit me with women’s boxing. All credit goes to them two women [who represented her]. Sarah Leslie, the solicitor who died of breast cancer at 42, and Dinah Rose, the top sex-discrimination barrister in the country by a mile. We were all young and one of the journalists wrote that we looked like three lesbians. I apologised to Dinah and Sarah because they’re middle-class women. They went: ‘Jane, it’s terrible.’ I was like: ‘This isn’t that bad compared to what I’ve been through.’

Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn’t see a way out

“Dinah messed them up because they thought she was going only on sex discrimination. She used that but focused on restraint of trade. I was already a double world champion and the board was stopping me making a living in this country. We won but, when I got the licence, I thought: ‘It will be all right now.’ The abuse got worse. Dinah knew it would happen. We left the press conference after the court case. She put her arms around me and goes: ‘I don’t want to tell you this, but your fight’s just beginning.’”

Couch’s eyes are clear again. “I know what she means now. I’d be on TV shows like Richard and Judy and they would have phone-ins for people to vote. ‘Is she a freak? Should she be allowed to box?’ When people keep calling you a freak you think, ‘Maybe I am?’ Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn’t see a way out.”

A year after she retired, in 2008, Couch had a breakdown. “I was very down. I didn’t want to go out. I was having panic attacks. Other women fighters were sending me messages about their problems. I had pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack.”

A friend took Couch to hospital and “this amazing lady doctor told me I was having a panic attack. I was like: ‘How can I have a panic attack? I’m not scared of anything.’ I told her what I did and she said: ‘You’ve got to bury boxing otherwise this will always haunt you.’”

Couch held a private little funeral for her boxing career in a graveyard. She tried to bury it, at least in her head if not the ground below her feet. It was an important symbolic step. “That night I slept properly for the first time. I started to think differently but it took two years on the [antidepressant] pills. Now I’m getting counselling and I’ve been off the pills for eight months. I’m feeling brilliant.”

Writing her book, and talking about it, has been distressing but Couch knows this is the road to lasting peace. “I wasn’t a skilful boxer. I fought with my heart. I learned that in the gym because I had to be tough – sparring with boys. Those first days in the gym were bad. They’d say: ‘Fuck off, you’re a girl.’ They laughed at me. They’re all skipping brilliant and I’m tripping over the rope. I could hear them laughing but I was thinking: ‘I’ll show you.’”

She laughs at her youthful audacity. Before her first world title fight against Geiger she trained for nine months and sparred against well-known male professionals such as Glenn Catley and Dean Francis. “Glenn was a serious puncher but he was good with me. They were all good with me but they still hit me. They’d be no good to me if they didn’t. They taught me to fight back when you’re hurt.”

Geiger was so well-known in France that, as Couch says, “The president of France [Jacques Chirac] was there when we fought. He gave her the belt but she took a hell of a beating. We both did. I had a metal plate in my cheekbone and I was pissing blood for three weeks after.”

Not one line about her becoming world champion was written in the national press or mentioned on radio or television. “I thought I was going to get mobbed at the airport but no one was there. I got Boxing News that next Friday. I was all excited but there was nothing. My manager shrugged. ‘They don’t do women’s boxing.’ He was as bad as them. A week later he said: ‘You’ve got a defence in New Orleans.’ I didn’t even want to go back to the gym but I convinced myself.”

Couch cleared £200, after expenses were deducted, for winning the world title. But the New Orleans promoter said he had no money to pay her after she won another hard fight. At least she ended up having Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali’s trainer, and the great former world champion Matthew Saad Muhammad helping in her corner. Couch also talks about the kindness of Marvin Hagler and Lennox Lewis, and her friendships with Frank Bruno and Ricky Hatton. But her love of boxing has soured.

“I wasn’t right a few years before I retired. I went on too long. We did the brain scan. They said: ‘Oh, you’ve had a slight alteration.’ I knew that meant brain damage. They said: ‘If you carry on taking blows it will get progressively worse.’ That’s why I retired.”

Does she feel any side-effects now? “Yeah. The memory’s a bit bad. But that’s most fighters, isn’t it? Physically I’m not too bad but I became institutionalised, I think, to the other damage.”

Many former fighters suffer from depression and Couch believes “boxing is definitely a factor. So many of my old sparring partners are in prison or on drugs or alcoholics. There’s got to be some connection with boxing when you look at all the lads in jail or on drugs.”

Couch’s toughest fight was against Lucia Rijker in Los Angeles in 2003. Rijker is arguably the greatest female boxer in history and Couch survived 10 rounds despite having an eardrum perforated. “I thought I was brain-damaged because there was a roaring in my head and my balance was totally gone. I was swallowing blood and it made a cracking sound. I thought: ‘Seven rounds to go. The damage is done. I might as well carry on.’”

After all the pain she suffered for such little reward does she feel any envy when hearing about Taylor’s headlining show? “Not a bit because I’ve buried it all now. What Katie’s done for boxing and women in Ireland is massive. I know because my fella’s Irish. She’s a superstar and that’s how it should be. It just wasn’t like that for me – or most women boxers today. I had a girl telling me her fight’s been cancelled because she didn’t sell enough tickets. That’s more typical of women’s boxing. It’s even been tough for Nicola Adams.”

When she won gold at the London Olympics in 2012, Adams made a point of acknowledging her success would not have been possible without Couch carving out a path before her. British boxing’s great female pioneer is still fighting to win her own battle to overcome everything that boxing did to her. Does she feel as if she is winning?

“I’m getting there,” she says with a little smile. “I’ve been with my partner Brian for nine years. We’re so happy. It’s helping me find a way out of boxing. It’s hard – but I’m happy when I’m not talking about boxing.”

It was always going to be routine for City with a six-goal cushion, courtesy of their 7-1 defeat of the Swiss side on the road, and with ‘Janine, Janine’ ringing round the ground to the tune of Blondie’s ‘Denis’, the 949 fans made sure they would enjoy progressing further than they did last year, when they went out to unseeded Atlético Madrid.

“I’m really pleased,” said Cushing, when asked of Bremer and Beckie’s goals. “In previous years we’ve assembled a squad where we’ve known our XI and had maybe seven or eight players we can call upon in some games.

“Last year and this year we’ve assembled a squad where we’ve got consistency across the board.”

It took just five minutes for City to dash any meagre hopes of a comeback, Keira Walsh threading a pass to Beckie who dinked it smoothly over Morgan Bertsch from just inside the box. After the half-hour City doubled their lead. Cushing gave chances to the Ireland youngster Tyler Toland and the 17-year-old Jess Park, who both impressed, but it was the more experienced Walsh and Beckie partnership that would give the manager the option of resting a few more legs. Walsh broke to the byline before slipping a cross across the face of goal for Beckie to poke in.

Cushing was full of praise for Walsh: “I will not hold back, she is up there with the most intelligent players I have worked with. She is pivotal for us.”

This was much more comfortable for City. The Nationalliga A runners-up Lugano have become an unlikely home for former US college players. They have 16 Americans in their ranks and 10 were in the starting line up to face City, with English defender Helen Seed the outlier (she too, though, played NCAA football).

Former NWSL player Beckie was the difference for City, and just two minutes after the break she had her third. A weak attempt at a clearance fell kindly at Beckie’s feet and the Canadian turned and powered a shot high past Bertsch. Bremer added a fourth, and her seventh in all competitions, when she carried the ball from deep, rounded Bertsch and prodded towards goal as she slipped to the ground."

But Dina Asher-Smith’s form is so ominous that the bookies give her a better than 50/50 shot of writing a new chapter in track and field history. They are running scared. Her opponents could be forgiven for feeling the same way.

After all, Asher-Smith is this year’s Diamond League winner over 100m, the clear favourite for gold over 200m, and the vital cog in Britain’s 4x100m women’s relay team who won silver in London two years ago. For most people in the sport it is not a question of whether she will win a medal in Doha, but how many and of which colour.

That is an enormous weight for Asher-Smith to bear on her 23-year-old shoulders, especially given that – Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Laura Muir apart – the British team do not possess a deep well of individual medal talent at these championships.

Asher-Smith insists that she has been planning to go global since 2017 – and is now ready to deliver. “My coach John Blackie has been putting me through my paces for a very long time to prepare for this,” she said.

“When we came off London 2017 and went into training for 2018, that was when we made the decision that I was going to double up and that is the time period you need to build up the strength to be able to put together six elite standard sprint races in a championships. We have been preparing for a very, very long time. It has been painful. John has been testing me. When he tells me: ‘You are doing this today,” I am like: ‘What?’

“But we have been preparing and that is why the decision to double up isn’t one that I have taken lightly, it’s not a flippant decision.”

The European championships last year in Berlin proved the perfect dress rehearsal as Asher-Smith beat her British records in running 10.85sec to win the 100m and 21.89 to take the 200m before winning her third gold in leading the relay team to victory with a stunning anchor leg. This time she knows it will be tougher, especially in the 100m where she faces the formidable Jamaican Olympic champions Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Elaine Thompson, who have both run 10.73 this season. The word from the Jamaican camp is that both are in fantastic shape for Doha, which could put gold out of reach for Asher-Smith in that event.

However in the 200m she is clearly the women to beat, especially with the Bahaman Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who has not lost a race since 2017, deciding to only run the 400m because of scheduling issues.

While Asher-Smith knows a podium place in the 100m or 200m would make her the first British woman since Kathy Smallwood-Cook in 1983 to win a global sprint medal, she insists she is not feeling the pressure. “Weirdly enough I don’t and I think that is because I tune out of social media. We have been very clear, John and I, about what my aims are for this season. And we don’t really publicly disclose that until afterwards and that is done deliberately to control expectation.

“There definitely is a little bit of expectation but it is something that is nice and something that is refreshing as a British female sprinter – we expect you to do X, Y and Z.”

However as she prepares for her first race, in the 100m heats on Saturday, Asher-Smith knows she is facing a moment of truth. “The world championships is going to be the first time where we see everybody with nowhere to hide this year. There’s no ‘I wasn’t ready for this, I wasn’t ready for this’, because if you are not ready for the world championships, when are you ready?”"

Thomas Cook’s chief executive has revealed the travel company had a balance sheet black hole of more than £3.1bn before its collapse on Monday.

In a witness statement to the high court, Peter Fankhauser also said the company had received seven non-binding offers for parts of its business under a strategic review, all of which were rejected by Thomas Cook’s board and lenders.

The company received five offers for its airline operation and one for a sale of the tour operator from Fosun, Thomas Cook’s largest shareholder. An offer was also received for its Nordic business, “which was followed by a fully financed offer at a later stage”.

Fankhauser added: “Following careful consideration by the board and in consultation with the lenders, the board decided not to pursue any of the bids.

“None of the bids were likely to realise sufficient value and following the disposal of any individual business division, the capital structure of the remaining group was unlikely to be sustainable. It would therefore not have been commercially justifiable.”

Thomas Cook was also approached at the start of August by the Turkish operator Anex Tour Group, which had built up an 8% stake. However, talks between Annex and Fosun failed to lead to a deal.

The witness statement laid bare the parlous state of Thomas Cook’s finances, with cash outflows that included £388m due to hotel partners and £272m to other external suppliers.

As the situation worsened at the company, payment service providers including American Express, UniCredit and Barclaycard moved to protect themselves from potential losses in the case of a collapse.

Fankhauser said: “[They] took steps to mitigate their financial exposure to the group, such as by withholding cash collections and cancelling the payment services which they provide to the group.

“These actions further demonstrated that the company’s stakeholders were beginning to take steps that negatively impacted the company’s liquidity and financial position.”"

In the first legal definition of a mother in English common law, Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the high court’s family division, ruled on Wednesday that motherhood was about being pregnant and giving birth regardless of whether the person who does so was considered a man or a woman in law.

Freddy McConnell, 32, who has lived as a man for several years but retained his female reproductive system and gave birth in 2018, went to court after a registrar insisted he was recorded as the baby’s mother on the birth certificate despite holding a gender recognition certificate that made it clear the law considered him male.

The ruling was quickly attacked by campaigners and lawyers as a blow to the rights of trans parents and their children and sparked calls, including from the judge, for legislative reform.

“Being a ‘mother’ or a ‘father’ with respect to the conception, pregnancy and birth of a child is not necessarily gender specific,” McFarlane concluded after McConnell requested a judicial review.

“There is a material difference between a person’s gender and their status as a parent. Being a ‘mother’, whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth.

The dad who gave birth: ‘Being pregnant doesn't change me being a trans man’ Read more

“It is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognised in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. Whilst that person’s gender is ‘male’, their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of ‘mother’.”

McConnell, a Guardian multimedia journalist who had experienced gender dysphoria since childhood and realised he was trans in 2010, aged 23, said he was “saddened” by the decision in favour of the government and the registrar, which resisted McConnell’s claim to be recognised as his child’s father. He is considering an appeal.

“If it is upholding the status quo then I am really worried about what that this means not just for me but other trans people who are parents or who want to become parents,” he said.

“It has serious implications for non-traditional family structures. It upholds the view that only the most traditional forms of family are properly recognised or treated equally. It’s just not fair.”

McConnell has long lived as a male, starting testosterone treatment in April 2013 and undergoing chest reshaping surgery in Florida. In 2016, he sought advice from a fertility clinic about becoming pregnant. His hormone treatment was suspended, which had the effect of reversing some of the gender-reassignment process, leaving him destabilised, which he described as a “loss of myself”. His menstrual cycle restarted and he became pregnant in 2017 using sperm from a donor. He gave birth in 2018.

McConnell’s journey to parenthood was captured in a recent feature-length documentary, Seahorse, a reference to the fish that reproduce through male pregnancies.

Stonewall, the LGBT charity, said the ruling was “deeply disappointing” and failed to recognise trans parents for who they were. “It’s another example of how current legislation contradicts the fragile equality trans people currently have,” said Laura Russell, the director of campaigns.

Michael Wells-Greco, a partner at the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, said the ruling “flies in the face of the social reality of this family” while the law firm Irwin Mitchell said it was time England “respect the human rights of the trans community” and follow Canada and Sweden, which allow gender neutral birth certificates.

The judge praised McConnell for “properly and bravely” bringing his case and said there was a “pressing need” for the government and parliament “to address square-on the question of the status of a trans male who has become pregnant and given birth to a child”.

He said existing legislation and UK and European human rights case law “do not themselves directly engage with the central question”.

He conceded that “the social and psychological reality” of McConnell’s relationship with his child was as a father and this was in tension with the law as it stands.

In the Netherlands, for example, trans men who give birth are registered as fathers.

In July, McConnell’s anonymity in the case was lifted following applications from news media organisations who argued the self-generated publicity around the pregnancy and birth in the film and the public interest in the question of how the state recognised parenthood meant his identity should be known.

McConnell’s wish to be registered as his child’s father plunged him into a web of different laws. His intrauterine insemination fertility treatment was governed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 which defines treatments as “assisting women to carry children”, his gender reassignment was under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and he registered the birth under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 which allows for people to tick “father/parent” only where a woman is to be a second female parent .

The registrar’s insistence McConnell be registered as “mother” appeared to him to be a result of an administrative need for every child to have a registered mother and was a breach of McConnell’s rights under the Human Rights Act 1998, his lawyers argued. Finally, those acting for the child applied under the Family Law Act 1986 for a declaration that McConnell was his father.

A representative for the child told the court that it was important for his identity and self-esteem that the birth certificate “reflects the reality of his life”.

“Father means male parent,” they said. “That is exactly what [McConnell] is. Anything else gives the impression of something secretive or shameful. This could lead [the child] to feeling excluded for society and that he is different or odd.”

McFarlane concluded the decision to register McConnell as a mother did not breach his or his child’s human rights and, given the Gender Recognition Act was both retrospective and prospective, it was also in line with that law.

The Aire Centre, a legal charity that helps people assert their human rights, also intervened in the case to highlight the right of children to be protected from discrimination due to the sexual orientation or gender identity of their parents, as well as children’s right to know their lineage."

Woman dies after being attacked by her two dogs in Cheshire

A woman has died after being attacked by her pet dogs at her home in Cheshire.

Police were called to a house in Widnes on Tuesday at about 5.15pm following reports that a woman, named locally as Elayne Stanley, 44, had been mauled by two dogs.

She was treated by paramedics but her injuries were too serious and she died at the scene.

Neighbours told the Liverpool Echo they had heard screaming and Stanley’s daughter shouting one of the dog’s names. Other neighbours reportedly tried to stop the attack by throwing bricks at the animals.

Another neighbour, Dorothy Woodward, described Stanley as “lovely”, adding: “She was a beautiful person and very friendly.”

Cheshire police said one of the dogs, thought to be a breed of mastiff, was destroyed. Officers tried to catch both dogs to remove them but were unable to tranquilise one, so it was shot and killed. The other dog is now in a secure kennel.

Stanley is thought to have had three daughters, including twins. Police said the woman’s next of kin had been informed and were being supported.

DI Ian Whiley said: “We understand that people in the local community will be concerned when they hear about what has happened.

“But I would like to reassure residents that we are doing all that we can to establish the full circumstances of the incident.

“However, at this stage, it is believed that the dogs were known to the woman and were living at the address.

“This has been an extremely distressing incident and our thoughts are with the woman’s family at this difficult time.”"

Ryanair has written to UK pilots asking them to take unpaid leave or transfer to other bases abroad, saying they could otherwise join the 9,000 job losses at Thomas Cook.

The airline, which reported profits of €1bn (£886m) in May, told its pilots that a “significant surplus of pilots must be reduced” at UK bases including Stansted and Manchester, and that it was encouraging them to take up to 12 months of unpaid leave.

It said that there were limited vacancies for full-time pilots at bases in Morocco, Romania and Hungary.

The memo, sent on Tuesday, said: “With yesterday’s collapse of Thomas Cook with the loss of 9,000 jobs in the UK and potentially a further 13,000 jobs across Europe, we hope that there will be sufficient applications for unpaid leave/part time, so we do not have to resort to job losses at [your base] this winter.”

It blamed the delay to Boeing 737 Max deliveries for the decision. Ryanair had ordered up to 135 of the aircraft for its expansion plans, with the first planes due this year. The model remains grounded, however, since the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.

The memo came a week after UK pilots called off the remainder of a series of strikes this month. The pilots union, Balpa, had complained about Ryanair’s “abysmal approach to industrial relations” and said the dispute over pay and conditions was driven by resentment over a range of cost-saving measures used by Ryanair.

Ryanair had called the strikes pointless and managed to operate the majority of its UK schedules by bringing in more contractors and pilots from overseas bases. The airline had warned of winter base closures across Europe.

Last week, the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, was awarded a new pay package in which he could receive a €99m (£88m) bonus within five years, although almost half of Ryanair shareholders voted against it."

Emergency services including a hazardous area response team were called to the site in south Wales shortly before 2pm on Wednesday.

Police initially described it as an “isolated incident” with no threat to the public. Officers later confirmed the man had been fatally injured.

“We can confirm that one person has died and his next of kin have been informed. We are now liaising with the Health and Safety Executive [HSE],” said a South Wales police spokeswoman.

Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, the constituency in which the steelworks is located, said: “Terrible, tragic news coming out of Port Talbot steelworks today. My heart and thoughts go out to the family and friends of the young man who has had his life so tragically cut short. I have just spoken with Tata, who will of course be launching an investigation.”

David Rees, the Welsh assembly member for Aberavon, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with his family and colleagues at this sad time. We must now await police & HSE investigation on this incident.”

A spokesperson for the Welsh ambulance service said: “We were called at approximately 1.58pm to reports of a person needing urgent medical attention after an accident with a machine at Tata steelworks, Port Talbot.

“We responded with two ambulance officers, one emergency ambulance, two vehicles of our hazardous area response team and our crews were supported by the Wales air ambulance.”

Tata Steel confirmed the incident in a tweet and said a full investigation had been launched.

In April, two workers were injured at the plant after several fires broke out when molten metal came into contact with cold water on a railway track.

The explosion and fire at the Tata Steel site lit up Port Talbot and could be heard up to 15 miles (24km) away.

In 2001, three men were killed and 12 injured in a blast at the plant, then owned by Corus.

The steelworkers’ union Community described the death as “absolutely tragic news” and said its thoughts were with the family of the worker.

“We will be pressing Tata Steel to carry out a full investigation and ensuring that all lessons are learnt, and procedures and processes are reviewed, and necessary changes are implemented to ensure all workers at the Port Talbot plant are safe at work,” said the union’s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss."

A motion tabled by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement was passed at the party’s conference in Brighton on Wednesday morning, after MPs were forced to rush back to Westminster to attend the newly reconvened House of Commons.

As well as extending voting rights, the text commits a future Labour government to closing all immigration detention centres, ending “no recourse to public funds” policies and seeking to extend free movement rights to people around the world.

The motion also opposed immigration systems based on a person’s income or “utility to big business”, and any caps or targets on the number of people moving to the UK.

The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, welcomed the motion and acknowledged it was now Labour policy. “Be assured, our plans for government include these provisions and a lot more, to make this country a better, more decent and more prosperous place,” she said.

Only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are able to vote in general elections, while EU nationals can vote in local and European elections.

Extending the vote to the 3 million EU nationals living in the UK would have a significant impact on the outcome of any second referendum on Britain’s EU membership.

Labour for Free Mvmt (@labfreemvmt) Now officially in the bin: pic.twitter.com/zEvRiYdLRk

Ana Oppenheim from the Labour Campaign for Free Movement and the pro-EU group Another Europe is Possible said it was “a source of shame for many activists” that the party’s 2017 manifesto pledged to end free movement.

“Now we can move forward not only committed to defending free movement, but to giving migrants the vote,” she said. “If we win, the next election will be the last election in which people like me are shut out of the democratic process.”

The home secretary, Priti Patel, was quick to criticise the move, saying Jeremy Corbyn did not believe in any limits on immigration.

“Corbyn’s Labour even wants to extend free movement to more countries and allow potentially dangerous illegal immigrants to roam our streets,” she said. “The British people voted to take back control. It’s only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives who will deliver Brexit by 31 October and end free movement once and for all.”

The conference motion read: “Confronted with attacks on migrants – from the racist hostile environment to the Conservatives’ immigration bill that plans to end free movement and strip the rights of working-class migrants – we stand for solidarity, equality and freedom.

“Scapegoating, ending free movement and attacking migrants’ rights are attacks on all workers. They make migrant workers more precarious and vulnerable to hyper-exploitation, pressing down wages and conditions for everyone. They divide us, making it harder to unionise and push back.”

Ben Towse, an organiser for the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, said the conference had made history by adopting a policy of “radical solidarity with migrants”.

He added: “The next Labour government will now make history by immediately closing every detention centre, by granting democratic rights to millions of people, by extending free movement and by taking on xenophobic scapegoating lies with workers’ unity and solidarity, across the artificial divisions of birthplace.”

Many migrants in the UK have residence on the condition that they have no recourse to public funds, meaning they are not able to claim most benefits, tax credits or housing assistance. The policy renders many destitute and reliant on charities to survive.

Celebrating the success of the motion, the Labour Campaign for Free Movement tweeted a photograph of the controversial “Controls on immigration” mugs produced by Labour during the 2015 general election campaign. “Now officially in the bin,” the tweet said.

At the 2017 election, Labour’s manifesto said freedom of movement within the EU would end when the UK ceased to be a member. After Brexit, the party wants a close relationship with the single market, but it has not formally committed to keeping the UK in the single market, which would ensure free movement continued."

In July Trump tweeted that congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley should “go back to the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came”. All four are US citizens and only Omar was born overseas.

The following day BBC Breakfast invited a Trump supporter on air to defend him, prompting Munchetty to discuss the US president’s use of loaded terms.

“Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism,” the BBC journalist told viewers in July. “Now, I’m not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.”

Her co-host, Dan Walker, asked her how she felt when she heard the president use such language. She replied: “Furious. Absolutely furious and I can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious a man in that position thinks it’s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that.”

Munchetty suggested that Trump’s use of such language encouraged others to use it before adding: “Anyway, I’m not here to give my opinion.”

The clip of their brief discussion went viral, with the BBC’s own accounts pushing it out on social media where it reached hundreds of thousands of people. But after a viewer complaint the corporation’s complaints unit decided that Munchetty had gone too far in expressing a personal opinion while broadcasting in her capacity as a BBC journalist.

A BBC spokeswoman said the complaints unit “ruled that while Ms Munchetty was entitled to give a personal response to the phrase ‘go back to your own country’ as it was rooted in her own experience, overall her comments went beyond what the guidelines allow for”.

Last week the same complaints unit found that the Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis had overstepped the mark during a discussion involving the Spectator columnist Rod Liddle, after a viewer complained she had been “sneering and bullying” towards the rightwing journalist.

The complaints unit concluded that the “persistent and personal nature of the criticism risked leaving her open to the charge that she had failed to be even-handed”."

Digital bank Monzo has closed its fee-charging packaged current account to new customers five months after launching it and is refunding some of those who signed up.

After being criticised by customers, the app-based bank said the premium service, Monzo Plus, “isn’t the best it could be”, and that things didn’t go according to plan. As a result, it is going back to the drawing board and may ditch Monzo Plus altogether.

The move is both a financial and PR blow for the company, which said recently that “there’s still plenty of work to do to get to profitability”.

Monzo recently passed the 3-million customer mark and is particularly popular among millennials.

Monzo Plus, which included features such as travel insurance and travel money, launched in April and was a key part of the company’s revenue strategy.

The bank initially offered a discounted monthly fee of £3. Then in August it unveiled a range of bundles costing up to £12 a month. One bundle, called the Supporter, cost £4.95 a month and offered exclusive Monzo Plus merchandise such as water bottles and T-shirts, plus access to prize draws to win metal payment cards.

But two weeks ago the bank admitted that, while a “significant number” of people had signed up for the Supporter package, “takeup of the new bundles isn’t what we’d hoped it would be” and it was therefore rethinking Monzo Plus.

In the latest development, a post on Monzo’s community forum, appeared to admit that many customers had been unhappy. It said that following the announcement two weeks ago, “we’ve decided to go one step further and start from the very beginning”.

One of the headings on the post reads: “New team, new product, new name?” Meanwhile, anyone clicking on the Monzo Plus section of the website will be met with a message saying it won’t be available for a while.

Tom Davies, a product marketing manager, said in the post that anyone who had an subscription and wanted to cancel could do so by contacting customer support.

He added: “If you’ve chosen our Supporter bundle, we’ll be automatically refunding the amount you’ve paid in fees, plus some interest, because you’re missing out on some of the features we offered.” This reflects the fact that the bank will not be sending out any “swag” or holding the prize draws."

The maker of the revived Routemaster bus and one of Northern Ireland’s biggest employers has collapsed into administration – leading immediately to 1,200 redundancies.

The failure of Wrightbus, which comes after a breakdown in 11th-hour rescue talks, represents the UK’s second significant insolvency of the week, following the demise of the holiday group Thomas Cook.

The Ballymena-based engineering company had been scrambling to find a buyer.

An expected sale evaporated at the end of last week when the Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, pulled out of talks. That double blow came days after the Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm.



Timeline Boris Johnson's failed 'New Routemaster' bus project Show Hide The original Routemaster bus was mostly withdrawn from service in London to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The original 1956 design was not accessible for wheelchair users, and was difficult for people with limited mobility or with pushchairs. Boris Johnson, then the Conservative mayoral candidate for London, announces he is contemplating introducing a modern-day Routemaster. Now elected mayor, Johnson announces the New Bus for London competition to design it. The requirements are for a low-floor red double-decker bus with at least one internal staircase, a rear open platform, and one other entrance/exit with doors. Six manufacturers are invited to compete to design and build the new bus, with Northern Ireland-based vehicle manufacturer Wrightbus awarded the contract in December. The final design is unveiled the following May. Johnson drives an early prototype of his bus in a public demonstration. The new bus goes into service for the first time, on the No 38 route between Clapton and Victoria. Johnson commits to ordering 600 of the buses at an anticipated cost of about £160m. Modifications to the design of the rear doors mean the buses will be operated with only a driver, and the “hop on/hop off” rear platform will be closed while the bus is not at a stop. This breaks Johnson’s election promise that the buses would be operated by two crew members and removes the unique “hop on/hop off” flexibility the original Routemaster had brought to London’s streets, the main reason for introducing the new design. Tfl spends an additional £2m fitting opening windows on the top deck of the buses, which Londoner nicknamed ‘Roastmasters’ for how hot they get inside. Temperatures had been recorded as high as 32.5C, higher than the legal limit for transporting live cattle. Sadiq Khan, Johnson’s successor as London mayor, declines to order further new routemaster buses. A TfL response to n freedom of information request reveals that the total capital cost of the vehicles is about £346m - approximately £430,000 per bus, nearly double the cost of purchasing conventional buses. It is announced that Wrightbus, the bus manufacturer Johnson contracted to build the buses, is goes into administration. Martin Belam

The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, has now been appointed administrator for a collection of the businesses within the group, including Wrights Group, Wrightbus, Wright En-Drive, Wright Composites and Metallix.

The firm’s collapse came after Boris Johnson told parliament his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus. Ian Paisley, the MP for North Antrim, also told the Guardian last week he believed the government had already demonstrated it could help the stricken manufacturer without breaching state aid rules by directing state-controlled companies to place orders with Wrightbus.

However, a government source strenuously denied any such assurances had been given. A source close to the company’s board also denied government support had been offered.

Michael Magnay, who is joint administrator, said: “We recognise the companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years.

“The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.”

The firms have about 1,250 employees and just 50 will remain to assist with the winding down if no buyer can be found.

Paisley said: “Administration, I hope, offers an opportunity to attract a sale on amended terms to the last month’s negotiations. I can’t imagine a situation where Ballymena would be without its bus building company and I hope we can get this matter resolved quickly.”

Workers dragged heavy toolboxes out of the factory after hearing the news. Gordon Mairs, who has been with the firm for 22 years, said many workers were angry with management.

“I haven’t really digested it yet,” he said. “It’s heart-wrenching. There’s been a lot of people with a lot of thoughts on the matter, but if anyone has questions to answer it’s the man at the top, Jeff Wright [the major shareholder of Wrights Group’s holding company].”

Ballymena has lost several major employers in recent years including the closure of sites operated by tyre maker Michelin and tobacco firm Gallaher.

Susan Fitzgerald, a regional secretary for the Unite trade union, said: “This town hasn’t recovered from Michelin, from Gallaher’s, [or] Blackbourne Electrical. In the last week, 100 more [jobs have] gone. It has to end at some point.

“Boris Johnson as his hobby makes buses out of wooden crates. What he needs to do is stop with his hobby and engage now straight away in a rescue plan to save these jobs and save this area. What future is there for young people in Ballymena?”

Unite added that it estimated a further 1,700 jobs were at risk in the supply chain. One Wrightbus supplier said: “There’s going to be a lot of debt out there. There’s a lot of local suppliers. For Ballymena and everything it’s not good.”

Sir William Wright, Jeff Wright’s father and the head of the family owners of Wrightbus, advocated Britain leaving the EU during the 2016 referendum. He also nominated Paisley as the Democratic Unionist party’s Westminster candidate. The DUP is a staunch backer of Brexit.

The parent company of Wrights Group also donated more than £16.1m to charity between 2012 and 2017. Those donations helped to fund the expansion of Green Pastures, an influential evangelical church in Ballymena run by Jeff Wright .

Workers said they planned to protest at the church on Sunday. Lee Kyle, who has 17 years’ experience of coach building at Wrightbus, said: “I think it’s disgusting. There’s 1,200 people put out of work because of the church. The men are destroyed. This is all they know since school. Where do they go?”

Following the donations, Wrightbus has increasingly been struggling with its finances and made two rounds of redundancies last year, with 95 jobs going in February and June. It had recent sales successes, including a Transport for London order in May for 20 hydrogen-powered buses, which each cost about £500,000 and only emit water as exhaust.

However, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, cancelled further purchases of the New Routemasters in 2016, which had been launched with a huge fanfare when Johnson was running the capital in 2012.

The UK bus market has since slowed. Operators have taken a cautious approach to new orders after ordering a large number of vehicles in recent years to meet stricter emissions standards.

In its last set of accounts, for the 12 months to December 2017, Wrights Group made sales of £227m and a profit of £1.5m – down from £264m and £10.7m on the year before. The financial position of the company is thought to have deteriorated significantly since the last financial update.

Before the potential bidders pulled out of talks last week, the company had raised staff hopes that a deal was imminent. On Thursday, Wrightbus management told employees it was “now in a race to complete a final deal with credible bidders”.

It added: “This ongoing business and its employees are our number one priority and we are confident that a positive outcome can be delivered over the next few days.”

Wrights Group did not comment.

Northern Ireland’s fallen industrial icons

Workers at Wrightbus are not the only employees in the Northern Irish manufacturing industry who have faced the loss of their jobs in recent years. Despite unemployment hitting record lows, work has stopped at some of the region’s industrial icons, taking away well-salaried jobs.

Harland and Wolff

The historic Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic was placed in administration last month, threatening the jobs of 140 workers. Harland and Wolff’s distinctive yellow cranes form the backdrop to the capital’s skyline, but workers still hope that the yard could be saved from permanent closure.

Bombardier

Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace company, put its Belfast operations up for sale in May as part of a wider restructuring. In June, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bought the company’s regional jet fuselage manufacturing arm, which carries out work in Belfast. However, a buyer has yet to be found for the rest of the Belfast business, descended from the pioneering Short Brothers, which makes wings and fuselages for aircraft such as the Airbus A220.

Michelin

Production at Michelin’s tyre plant in Ballymena ended in 2018, costing 860 jobs. The French company cited a downturn in demand for truck tyres in Europe after the financial crisis for its decision, while relatively high energy costs made the plant less competitive than other factories. Local politicians sought to attract luxury carmaker Aston Martin to take on the plant but Ballymena lost out to a site in Wales.

Gallaher

Japan Tobacco International announced the closure of the Gallaher’s cigarette plant in Ballymena in 2014, amid a decline in the number of European smokers. The final closure came in 2017 but Wrightbus took over the Gallaher’s site, initially providing some hope to the local economy before Wednesday’s closure."

With Boris Johnson facing mounting calls to resign following this week’s supreme court ruling, and a brewing conflict of interest scandal, he is likely hoping nothing else will add to his list of woes.

But the prime minister has another potential pitfall on the horizon as, the Guardian has learned, the investigative author Tom Bower is writing a biography of him.

The award-winning journalist, whose wife, Veronica Wadley, served as a senior adviser to Johnson during his time as mayor of London, confirmed the book will be ready to hit the shelves next year.

Bower, who has been responsible for a series of damning biographies about high-profile figures over the years, has a reputation for unearthing damaging revelations about his subjects. He is said to specialise in books about “men with something to hide”.

News of the impending book will come as an unwelcome headache for the prime minister – who has a notoriously colourful private life – after a series of damaging revelations in recent months, including his late-night row with girlfriend Carrie Symonds.

This week, the prime minister stonewalled questions about a Sunday Times investigation that revealed he had a close friendship with US model-turned-entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, whose business received public funds while he was mayor. It comes as Johnson was hit by the supreme court’s ruling on Tuesday that his move to suspend parliament was illegal.

Bower has penned a series of biographies about Labour political figures including Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown but it is the first time he will dig into the life of a Conservative leader.

The columnist Peter Oborne accused Bower of systematically distorting the truth in his biography of the Labour leader, Dangerous Hero: Corbyn’s Ruthless Plot for Power, which was released earlier this year. In a scathing review, he wrote: “[The book] systematically omits relevant facts in order to portray Corbyn as a ruthless Marxist and antisemite hellbent on destroying western liberal values.”

By comparison, the Times’ review labelled it a “forensically detailed portrait” of Corbyn. Despite the praise, the reviewer concluded: “Yet Bower never really unpicks precisely why so many people, despite everything, continue to support such a joyless, limited and dogmatic man.”

Other biographies authored by Bower include books on Prince Charles, the Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone, the billionaire Richard Branson, TV judge Simon Cowell and the businessman Mohamed Al Fayed. In 2003, Bower won the prestigious William Hill sports book of the year prize for Broken Dreams: Vanity, Greed and the Souring of British Football, his investigation into corruption in the game.

Bower’s latest book is published by Ebury, part of Penguin Books. It will be the third major biography of Johnson, following Sonia Purnell’s Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, published in 2011, and Andrew Gimson’s 2006 Boris: The Rise of Boris Johnson.

Wadley, a former editor of the Evening Standard who has been married to Bower for more than 30 years, was a senior adviser to Johnson from 2012 to 2016.

Drummond Moir, the group deputy publisher at Ebury, said: “WH Allen are proud to confirm they have signed up Britain’s leading investigative biographer to write a new biography of Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. Written with Bower’s trademark access, insight and candour, the book will be published in 2020.”

Stefano Miserocchi, the mayor of the town of Courmayeur, said “public safety is a priority” after experts from the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountains Foundation) in the Aosta Valley said up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice was in danger of sliding off the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak.

“This phenomenon once again testifies that the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,” Miserocchi said in a statement.

Experts have been monitoring the glacier closely since 2013 to detect the speed at which the ice is melting, and Miserocchi said the rate had “significantly increased” recently. But they are unable to predict when the ice would break away.

“There are currently no empirical models or methods that can enable quantitative predictions in the case of glaciers with sliding dynamics such as Planpincieux,” Miserocchi added.

The warning comes as world leaders meet in New York for the UN climate action summit. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: “The news that part of Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that should not leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and force us to mobilise.”

In 2017, about 50 cubic metres of ice fell from Planpincieux, while in September last year a mass of ice broke away from the Glacier de la Charpoua, on the south-east side of the Aiguille Verte, on the French side of Mont Blanc.

Miserocchi’s order came into force on Tuesday and includes the evacuation of homes and mountain refuges in the area. He said it was a precautionary measure and there was no threat to residential areas or tourist establishments. The zones affected are in the area of Val Ferret.

Rising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt, with environmental activists in Switzerland holding their second “mourning ceremony” on the evaporating Pizol glacier in the country’s Glarus Alps on Monday. The glacier has lost up to 90% of its volume since 2006. In August, a similar event was held at a glacier in Iceland.

A heatwave across Europe this summer is also said to have accelerated the melt speed."
201,,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/25/israels-president-chooses-netanyahu-to-form-government,2019-09-25T18:11:31,Israel's president chooses Netanyahu to form government,"Israel’s president has tasked Benjamin Netanyahu with forming a coalition government, throwing a lifeline to the incumbent prime minister after an inconclusive election threatened to end his political career.

Reuven Rivlin’s offer does not guarantee Netanyahu will lead Israel’s next administration. Before that can happen, Netanyahu has up to six weeks to forge a majority coalition in Israel’s parliament.

“The responsibility for forming the government will be handed to prime minister and Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu,” the president’s office said in a statement.

With a divided Knesset, the 69-year-old leader now faces an uphill battle to secure support from at least 61 of 120 lawmakers. If his attempts fail, Rivlin could assign the task to someone else, most likely Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition.

That scenario almost played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.

Many fear a third election will be called if the stalemate holds.

The president had been pushing the two main parties to put aside their differences and form a unity government as together they would have more than enough seats for a majority. Talks appeared to have stalled.

Domestic media speculated the Rivlin may have picked Netanyahu as a way of pushing the two to reach an agreement. The president could have waited up to a week to decide but his announcement adds pressure on Netanyahu to make political deals on a deadline or risk losing grip on power.

The prime minister has several potential routes to form a government, but many would require lawmakers from rival parties to defect. The clearest path would be to get support from Avigdor Lieberman, whose eight seats afford him a kingmaker status. However, Lieberman, a secular ultranationalist, has refused to sit in a government with religious parties, whose support Netanyahu also depends on.

Netayahu’s freedom is also potentially on the line. Next week, pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him are set to begin. If he retains the role of prime minister, he will not be required to step down, even if indicted. Netanyahu has denied all allegations.

The central election committee released an official vote tally on Wednesday from last week’s poll that confirmed an inconclusive, razor-thin margin between the two main parties, the ruling Likud and Blue and White.

Blue and White was one seat ahead, but neither party had enough support from lawmakers to form a majority coalition. Netanyahu, however, came out narrowly ahead of Gantz when Rivlin asked this week for all parliamentarians to endorse a candidate.

There is a precedent in Israel for political rivals to serve together after Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres rotated the role of prime minister in the mid-1980s, each agreeing to serve two years.

Yet there was little optimism Gantz and Netanyahu could forge a unity government, as both men have demanded the top seat. Gantz, whose election campaign focused on toppling Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has also repeatedly pledged not to ally with Netanyahu while he faces potential indictments.

Further complicating talks, Netanyahu also struck an agreement with rightwing and religious parties that back him to make sure they are part of any future government, something Gantz has sought to avoid."

Parliament is now expected to debate the matter, which was highlighted by the Milan trial of an activist who helped a tetraplegic man die in Switzerland.

Anyone who “facilitates the suicidal intention … of a patient kept alive by life-support treatments and suffering from an irreversible pathology” should not be punished under certain conditions, the top court ruled.

The court was asked to rule on the case of Fabiano Antoniani, known as DJ Fabo, a music producer, traveller and motocross driver left tetraplegic and blind by a 2014 traffic accident.

Marco Cappato, a member of Italy’s Radical party, drove Antoniani to Switzerland in February 2017 where he was helped to die, aged 40.

Helping or instigating someone’s suicide is currently punishable by between five and 12 years in prison in Italy.

Cappato hailed the ruling in a tweet: “Those who are in Fabo’s condition have the right to be helped. From today we are all more free, even those who disagree. It is a victory of civil disobedience, while the (political) parties turned their heads away”.

The Italian Episcopal Conference expressed its “discontent and distance” from the court’s decision, quoting Pope Francis who on Friday spoke out against assisted suicide and euthanasia.

“We can and we must reject the temptation, which is also favoured by legislative changes, to use medicine to satisfy a sick person’s possible wish to die,” the pope said.

The Italian bishops asked for lawmakers to “recognise these values” when debating the matter.

Beppino Englaro, who was involved in a 2008 court battle to end the life of his daughter Eluana due to her being in a vegetative state, hailed Cappato as “a pioneer who opened the way to establishing a right”.

The court said that a patient’s condition must be “causing physical and psychological suffering that he or she considers intolerable”. Following approval of the decision by a local ethical committee, public health authorities should verify all conditions are met.

The head of the powerful Catholic Doctors Association (AMCI), Filippo Boscia, announced the “conscientious objection” of its members and slammed “a slide towards euthanasia and a violation of our professional code”.

Italy’s Coscioni Association said that more than 800 Italians had said on their “SOS Euthanasia” website that they would like to die through assisted suicide.

Far-right leader Matteo Salvini, who strives to appeal to Catholic voters and frequently kisses his rosary at rallies, said he was “opposed to state-sponsored suicide imposed by the law”.

Leftwing MP Nicola Fratoianni tweeted: “After the ruling, there are no more alibis: parliament should be capable of making a law of freedom for those who ask for self-determination and dignity for their lives.”

The court had since Tuesday been re-examining the question of legalising assisted suicide after it gave parliament last October a one-year deadline to fill a legal void on the thorny issue, but MPs have not done so.

“The current legal framework concerning the end of life deprives specific situations … of adequate protection,” the court wrote last year.

Cappato turned himself in to Italian authorities after his “act of civil disobedience” to highlight what he saw as an unjust law.

He pointed out that assisted suicide was reserved for those with the physical and financial means to travel to Switzerland, where it is legal.

“I feel like I’m in a cage. I would like to choose to die without suffering,” Antoniani wrote to the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, before his death in Switzerland.

A Milan court is trying Cappato on the charge of “instigating or assisting suicide”, but asked the constitutional court to clarify the current law. He is likely to be acquitted following the constitutional court’s decision."

Weaker growth in both advanced and developing countries means the possibility of a global recession in 2020 is a clear and present danger, the UN has warned.

In a flagship report, the UN’s trade and development body, Unctad, said 2019 will endure the weakest expansion in a decade and there was a risk of the slowdown turning into outright contraction next year.

The UN said warning lights were flashing around trade wars, currency gyrations, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and movements in long-term interest rates but there was little sign that policymakers were prepared for the coming storm.

The annual trade and development report said finance ministries and central banks should end their “obsession with stock prices, quarterly earnings and investor confidence” and instead focus on job creation, boosting wages and increasing public investment.

The Unctad report said: “A spluttering north, a general slowdown in the south and rising levels of debt everywhere are hanging over the global economy: these combined with increased market volatility, a fractured multilateral system and mounting uncertainty, are framing the immediate policy challenge.”

It said the global economy remained fragile even though the financial crisis ended a decade ago, and called for a fundamental rethink of a “business as usual” model that had saddled the developing world with record levels of debt.

The report also said: “The macro-economic policy stance adopted to date has been lopsided and insufficiently co-ordinated to give a sustained boost to aggregate demand, with adjustments left to the vagaries of the market through a mixture of cost-cutting and liberalisation measures. Ephemeral growth spurts and financial volatility have been the predictable results.”

Global growth will fall from 3% in 2018 to 2.3% this year – its weakest since the 1.7% contraction in 2009, according to the report. Several big emerging countries were already in recession and some advanced economies, including Germany and the UK, were dangerously close to one.

Central banks , including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have recently announced interest cuts in an attempt to stimulate activity but the UN report was pessimistic about the chances of success.

“The slowdown in growth in all the major developed economies, including the US, confirms that relying on easy monetary policy and asset price rises to stimulate demand produces, at best, ephemeral growth, while tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals fail to trigger productive investment.”

Unconventional monetary measures – such as negative interest rates and creating money through quantitative easing – remained the go-to policies for addressing weaknesses in the global economy even though they have had a weak record since the financial crisis.

Trade growth was expected to slow sharply this year as a result of a slump in global demand and the protectionist measures announced by Donald Trump.

The UN stressed the need to look beyond the short-term threat of recession to deeper and long-running threats.

“Beyond the immediate risks that could stall the global economy are a series of macrostructural challenges that predate the global financial crisis and have gone largely unattended since then,” the report said.

It added that four issues stood out due to their high degree of interdependence: the smaller share of the economy’s proceeds going to labour; the erosion of public spending; the weakening of investment; and the unsustainable increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

It continued: “Climate protection requires a massive new wave of investment, reinventing energy and other carbon-emitting sectors. New low-carbon technologies must be created, installed and maintained on a global scale.”

The report also highlighted increased green investment, which it said would be a significant source of income and jobs. “Recent discussions call this strategy the Green New Deal, recalling the 1930s New Deal, which tackled unemployment and low wages, the predatory nature of finance, infrastructure gaps and regional inequalities, in the context of recovering from the Great Depression.”"

Canada’s Green party has admitted to manipulating a photograph on its website to make it seem as if the party leader was using a reusable plastic cup and metal straw instead of a disposable paper cup.

The image shows Elizabeth May, smiling and holding a plastic cup emblazoned with the Green party logo and with a metal straw inserted in its cover.

But the same photo had previously appeared on news websites and showed that May was holding a paper cup with no straw, the National Post reported.

Confronted with the clear discrepancy, May told reporters she was “completely shocked” that staff had edited the image without her approval.

“And I’m sorry for the staff person that did it. I don’t want to call them stupid on television, but there was nothing there to hide. So why Photoshop it? I have no idea.”

May denied that the manipulated image was meant to bolster her environment credentials, arguing that paper cups are compostable.

“It won’t surprise you to know I never take a plastic drinking water bottle, I carry my own mug, I carry my own utensils on airplanes so I never take a single-use plastic item,” May told reporters. “So it’s bizarre that the notion of fakery should stretch to someone who doesn’t fake anything.”

In recent months, plastics have become an environmental touchstone in Canadian politics, after the Liberal government pledged in June to ban single-use plastics, including disposable plates and utensils, by as early as 2021. Shortly afterwards, however, Justin Trudeau was photographed in a meeting with single-use items scattered on the table, and as a result, some politicians have become wary of images that could potentially undercut their environmental credentials.

May did, however, have advice for her team in the event they chose to manipulate another image: “If they’re going to Photoshop, couldn’t they do something with my face and make it look a little younger?”"

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, lavished praise on Egypt at a bilateral meeting with its president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in New York, hours before the UK hosted a global media freedom conference with Amal Clooney, the UK’s special envoy on media freedom.

Sisi has just instigated a fresh massive crackdown on journalists following the outbreak of protests against corruption in Egypt.

As part of the repression, the Egyptian government has added the BBC and the US-based Arabic language Alhurra news channel to 513 websites already blocked in Egypt. In addition, online messaging applications have been disrupted to thwart further protests. The Egyptian government has also sent advisory warnings to foreign reporters on how they must cover the protests.

Civil society groups, including the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, said so far 1,003 people had been arrested including prominent academics.

Johnson and Sisi held their bilateral meeting on the margins of the UN general assembly hours before the UK hosted a high-profile event designed to drive home its support for a campaign to develop new laws that will defend journalists’ rights.

But the president’s spokesman Bassam Radi reported after the meeting with Johnson that the UK was “keen to praise Egypt’s economic performance noting that the Egyptian economy is witnessing an obvious improvement”.

The presidential spokesperson also said the two leaders discussed efforts to curb terrorism and extremism, enhancing the exchange of information and preventing funding for terrorist activities.

The bland Downing Street read-out of the meeting also made no mention of the crackdown on protests. It simply said “the leaders recalled their constructive meeting at the G7 Summit in Biarritz and reconfirmed their commitment to work together to build on the positive progress in our bilateral relationship”.

It added “They discussed our two countries’ economic ties and the importance of building on this after the UK leaves the EU”.

Officials said the media crackdown may have been raised privately with Sisi. But the absence of any criticism of the assault on press freedom in the read-out raises questions about whether the UK government is willing to hold repressive autocrats to account in public about issues of media freedom, especially if commercial ties might be threatened.

Pressed at the media freedom summit in New York on whether ministers are prepared to make its case directly to resistant world leaders, Lord Ahmad, the human rights minister, said the UK government often raised human rights issues in private as well as public. He insisted this private pressure had an effect.

The UK held a high-profile media freedom conference in the summer and Clooney, a champion of threatened journalists, has helped established a high-level panel of legal experts to examine what global laws are needed to defend press freedom globally.

At the meeting in New York, Ahmad reaffirmed the UK’s intention, after Brexit, to establish a UK global human rights sanctions regime to hold those who commit serious violations of human rights to account, including when journalists, whistleblowers and human rights defenders are targeted. He said a statutory instrument would be introduced as soon as possible.

Clooney, the leading lawyer defending journalists under threat, said: “If democracy is to have any chance of survival we need leaders who believe in liberal values to step up.”

She said journalists were made incredibly vulnerable by the rising drumbeat of senior officials vilifying the media and creating a toxic environment.

She said the current international treaties defending freedom of expression were ineffective, adding the team of senior legal experts created two months ago and chaired by former supreme court president Lord Neuberger set up by the UK Foreign Office was drawing up model laws needed to embed a genuine free press.

She favours five new tools including targeted sanctions regimes, freezing bank accounts and entry bans against state officials that abuse media freedom, deployment of a team of international lawyers capable of investigating attacks, a commitment to transparency when a journalist is arrested, enhanced consular advice and a system of visas for reporters suffering persecution."

Elizabeth Warren’s surge to the very top of the Democratic primary field is continuing, after the Massachusetts senator topped a national poll for the first time on Wednesday.

A survey by Quinnipiac found Warren polling at 27% among Democrats and Democratic leaning voters, with Joe Biden on 25%. Bernie Sanders, previously seen as part of a top three of Democratic presidential candidates, had 16%.

With margin of error factored in Warren is essentially tied with Biden, but the poll represents a major boost, coming after a slew of recent surveys in recent days found her leading or tied in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.

The Quinnipiac poll contained bad news for the California senator Kamala Harris, who was at just 3%, and the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, who was the choice of 0% of Democratic leaning voters. South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg was at 7%.

On Sunday a survey of likely Iowa caucusgoers, carried out by the Des Moines Register, Mediacom and CNN, put Warren at 22% in the state, with Biden at 20%. Sanders had the support of just 11% of respondents, with Buttigieg on 9%.

Two polls released on Tuesday showed Warren also surging in New Hampshire and Nevada. The New Hampshire survey, carried out by Monmouth University, found Warren at 27% in the Granite state, to Biden’s 25%. The margin of error was 4.9%. That survey was a particular blow to Sanders, who was at just 11%, despite winning the New Hampshire primary with 61% of the vote in 2016.

A Suffolk University/USA Today/Reno Gazette-Journal poll in Nevada found Biden at 23% and Warren at 19%.

The release of the Quinnipiac survey comes after Warren announced that she will spend at least $10m on advertising in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the Democratic primary.

Warren’s national support has increased dramatically since Quinnipiac’s August poll. In that survey Biden had 32% support, with Warren at 19%."

Sandra Muller said Eric Brion had humiliated her with sexual remarks at a function in Cannes in 2012. She was ordered to pay €15,000 in damages to the executive and €5,000 in legal fees, and was also told to delete a tweet about him and publish the statements issued by the court on her Twitter account and in two press outlets.

Muller, a French journalist based in the US, vowed to appeal. She called the verdict a “backwards step” against the force of an “amazing movement” and said women must “continue the fight”. Her lawyer, Francis Szpiner, said the verdict was out of keeping with current times and a “regression”.

Muller started a viral hashtag in French in October 2017 called #balancetonporc (“expose your pig”), which called on French women to name and shame men in an echo of the #MeToo movement that began in response to allegations that toppled the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

In a Twitter post, Muller had quoted Brion as saying: “You have big breasts. You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night.”

Brion, a media consultant and former head of the TV channel Equidia, acknowledged making inappropriate remarks for which he had apologised by text message the next day. But he sued for defamation, claiming Muller’s post wrongly portrayed him as a sex offender and that the publicity around the incident had ruined his career.

When the hearing opened in May, Brion’s legal team defended his “right to flirt”. Muller defended her right to freedom of expression and said her tweet meant sexist insults would be taken seriously.

Her post led to an outpouring of tales of harassment and assault, which were hailed as helping to confront a culture of permissiveness in France towards unwanted advances.

In a column in Le Monde in 2017, Brion admitted making “inappropriate remarks” to Muller at a cocktail party.

He wrote: “Effectively I did make misplaced comments to Sandra Muller during a drunken cocktail party very late one night, but only once. I liked her. I told her so, heavy-handedly. And only once, I must point out. I don’t want to exonerate myself from my boorishness at the time. I reiterate my apologies.”

But he accused Muller of “deliberately creating ambiguity about what happened” by linking it to the response to the Weinstein affair.

Brion learned of the guilty verdict with a “certain degree of relief and reaffirms he has never harassed Sandra Muller”, his lawyer, Nicolas Benoit, told AFP.

Earlier this year, Denis Baupin, a Green MP and former vice-president of the lower house in the French parliament, lost a defamation suit against six women who accused him of sexual harassment and four journalists who had reported the allegations. His decision to sue for defamation was seen as a backlash against the #MeToo movement in France."

Spain has not had a stable government for years, with mainstream parties and newcomers that have appeared over the past five years struggling to strike deals.

The Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez, won a snap election in April but without enough seats for his party to govern on its own, and he ended up calling an election for November after failing to reach a deal with the leftwing Unidas Podemos.

Podemos was the dazzling new force in Spanish politics. What went wrong? | Giles Tremlett Read more

Íñigo Errejón, a co-founder of Podemos, which he left in January after disagreements with its leader, Pablo Iglesias, said he was launching the party, Más País (More Country), because he wanted to help form a government and encourage disillusioned leftwing voters to turn up at the polling stations.

“I understand the widespread anger of the Spanish people with the current leaders and with the political stalemate,” he said in front of a crowd cheering “president”.

Errejón’s party could further fragment the vote and either help the right get a majority or make it harder for any bloc to do so. There was already no guarantee the new election would make it any easier to strike a deal to form a government, and there will now be three main parties on the left and the right, after the far-right Vox made a breakthrough in the April election.

“This makes it even more difficult to foresee how the new parliament will look, and what type of feasible majorities will emerge,” said José Fernández-Albertos, a political scientist at Spanish National Research Council.

Podemos was the dazzling new force in Spanish politics. What went wrong? | Giles Tremlett Read more

Errejón, 35, who is considered more moderate than Iglesias and was his second in command in Podemos, had in 2016 backed an agreement with the Socialists that Iglesias eventually rejected. In a recent interview, Errejón said he was in favour of a government deal with Sánchez.

In his first speech as a candidate, Errejón said he wanted to achieve an agreement among leftwing forces to form a government.

Sánchez is currently ahead in opinion polls, but Errejón and Iglesias are on bad terms, making a three-way government deal potentially difficult.

Based on how a previous, regional party he set up earlier this year did in local elections in May, Errejón could hope to get as many as five seats in the national parliament in the Madrid region alone.

Some analysts said the new party could convince leftwing voters put off by the lack of a deal between the Socialists and Podemos to turn up at polling stations.

“The leftwing electorate is going to be motivated. Some to defend Iglesias, others to punish him,” Fernández-Albertos said."

A third of Germany’s landmass is covered in woodland, and forests play an important role in the country’s national folklore, from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm to the poems of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

But a combination of storms, drought, forest fires and aggressively spreading bark beetle plagues have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 250,000 football fields, forcing the government to convene an emergency “forest summit”, held on Wednesday in Berlin.

“Every missing tree is a missing comrade-in-arms against climate change,” agriculture minister Julia Klöckner said ahead of the gathering of around 170 organisations representing both environmental groups and industry. “Whatever we don’t reforest today, our grandchildren will, of course, miss.”

In the face of the numerous challenges, Germany’s federal government has announced making available €547mover the next four years to remove dead trees and plant new ones, with state contributions boosting the emergency fund to €800m. The defence minister and CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has pledged the military’s help with the effort.

Woodland owners however insist their trees deserve better financial compensation for cleaning polluted air.

Representatives of the country’s influential forestry industry – employing some 720,000 people, almost as many as the car sector – have already warned the funds won’t be enough to replace the forest that has been lost.

Umbrella organisation AGDW, representing forest owners and forestry workers, has called for direct investments of €2.3bn, as well as a new tax on industrial pollution that would help to subsidise forests at €125 a year per hectare of forest.

Trees absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO₂), and their leaves can trap the toxic pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone, and harmful microscopic particles produced by diesel vehicles, cooking and wood burning. According to AGDW, Germany’s forest currently compensates 14% of the country’s CO₂ emissions.

“Those who pollute our environment with dirt have to pay for it, and those who receive the dirt should be financially compensated in turn”, forest owner Ferdinand Graf von Westerholt told broadcaster ZDF. “That’s the solution.”

But even how the funds already made available can be used has become a divisive issue between landowner and environmentalists. The forestry industry proposes replanting areas of destroyed forest with some non-native species that are more suited to a drier and hotter climate, such as the Japanese larch, the North American Douglas fir or the northern red oak.

Environmental groups warn this could have a devastating impact on local wildlife, which could struggle to adapt to the new environment.

Hubert Weiger, chair of the German branch of Friends of the Earth said cash should be injected on “public money for public services” principle: “Taxpayers’ money should only be spent to build up natural broad-leaved deciduous forests made up of native species”."

But they are obscured by unreliable male narrators

Only two women get any real page space in Donna Tartt’s debut The Secret History: Camilla Macaulay, the ethereal yet steely sole female member of the novel’s core friendship circle; and Judy Poovey, the vulgar and brash Californian with a crush on the novel’s narrator, Richard Papen. The two seem to come from different planets. Camilla is cool, intelligent, untouchable, beautiful; Judy has “wild clothes, frosted hair, and a red Corvette with California plates bearing the legend JUDY P” as well as a voice “which rang through the house like the cries of some terrifying tropical bird”.

For a while, I played a game with the rest of Tartt’s female characters that goes: Camilla or Judy? The Goldfinch’s narrator Theodore Decker’s unrequited love, Pippa, is a Camilla, as is his mother Audrey; background girlfriends Xandra and Kotku are Judys. It’s strangely easy to fit every woman into these two categories, as though there are only two ways to be a woman.

The scarcity and restraint of female characters in Tartt’s novels is frustrating, even to super-fans like myself. Where Theo grows up in real time in The Goldfinch and Richard gets to anxiously navigate both college experience and murder plot in The Secret History, Tartt’s only female main character – Harriet Dufresnes, the 12-year-old heroine of The Little Friend – is forever stalled in time, dreading a womanhood that never arrives.

Her youth allows her to escape the Camilla-Judy classification system, and it’s hard to imagine her growing up into either. She’s too dour to be a Camilla, too curious and clever to be a Judy. But what seems at first a more nuanced version of femininity is quickly subsumed into a wider disgust at adult womanhood; Harriet fears adolescence, especially the “horrifying new indignity of being classed … a ‘Teen Girl’: a creature without mind, wholly protuberance and excretion”.

Sometimes I wonder about the Tartt heroines we could have had. What if The Secret History was about five feral girls and their token boy instead?

The other women in The Little Friend are defined strictly in opposition to Harriet, and found lacking. Harriet’s older sister Allison is a “mild, gentle girl”, unlike Harriet the “bright-eyed tiger cub”. “There were plenty of girls at school prettier than Harriet, and nicer,” Harriet’s best friend Hely (a boy) thinks. “But none of them were as smart, or as brave.” The teenage girls at Harriet’s summer camp are filthy in their visceral physicality and stupid to boot: “Their conversation (the Bay City Rollers; the Osmonds; some boy named Jay Jackson who went to their school) bored and irritated her.” Harriet’s only hope is to hold on to her fierce sense of interiority and selfhood even as her teen years begin, but we never know if she succeeds. The novel ends before she has to try.

Given Tartt’s skill in writing friendships, it is remarkable that there are no real friendships between women in any of her three novels. Camilla is the only girl in The Secret History’s gang; Kitsey’s friendships with other women in The Goldfinch are alluded to without description; in The Little Friend, Harriet’s only friend is a boy who can barely keep up with her.

It’s easy to condemn Tartt for the lack of women in her work. It may pass the Bechdel test on technicalities – Judy Poovey talks to friends in The Secret History; there is a mother-daughter conversation in The Goldfinch – but the Bechdel test’s ultimate goal of substantial representation cannot be satisfied by her novels. Women rarely speak, plot or work together, nor even fight or love one another. But our immediate attraction towards a particular kind of feminist impulse will lead us down the wrong avenues when it comes to Tartt, because in fact every one of her women is rich, dangerous and complex. The problem is that they can’t be touched.

The great pleasure and privilege of Tartt’s first-person perspective is its all-encompassing immersion; notably, her one book led by a female character, The Little Friend, is told in third person. But part of that immersion involves a wilful blindness to the interiority of women. In a conversation with Camilla in The Secret History, Richard looks “at the side of her face, listening to the sweet, throaty cadences of her voice, when I was jolted from my musing by a sharp exclamation”. It’s almost funny: he’s not listening to her at all! Camilla is an unsatisfying, insubstantial ghost because Richard has no interest in what lies underneath her physical allure; she is “the real mystery, the safe I could never crack”.

Theo Decker is a bit more self-aware. His infatuation for Pippa is “as if – sick with loneliness for my mother – I’d imprinted on [Pippa] like some orphaned animal”; romance is more about gaining comfort and safety. He is less self-aware when it comes to his fiancee Kitsey, whom he worries does not have the emotional depths he requires, “so that sometimes I got the disconcerting sensation of wading around in knee-high waters hoping to step into a drop-off, a place deep enough to swim”. A few pages later, when Theo stumbles upon Kitsey in the arms of another man, “talking quietly, in a low voice husky with emotion”, Tartt shows us a glimpse of her true depth, which Theo can’t see.

Resisting the psychological pull of these unreliable narrators allows us glimpses of strange, complicated women Tartt knows down to their bones. Judy is kind and generous even with her parrot voice; she takes care of Richard, offers advice and is revealed in the epilogue to be one of the more successful graduates of their college. Pippa has a life full of trauma that Theo actively avoids thinking about, while Xandra, his apparently ditzy stepmother, is one of the few people in The Goldfinch who knows exactly what he’s doing; she just has no interest in intervening.

It’s obviously Tartt’s narrators who are shallow when it comes to the women they meet, not the women themselves. But this means that we never get to wade into those waters either. We watch their turbulent seas from over the clifftop, permitted to glimpse but not to enter. In this context, Harriet becomes less a determined outsider to the ranks of women and more a tragedy waiting to happen, her perspective about to be immolated.

At the same time, it is both undeniable and exhausting that if Camilla were the hero of The Secret History or Pippa the star of The Goldfinch, the novels would be very different, because women don’t move in the world the same way men do. Theo stumbles into the world of underground gangsters; Richard spends a winter nearly freezing to death. Their lives aren’t easy, wrestling with trauma, class, loss and grief. But if they were women, there would be an additional layer of disadvantage they would have had to fight through just to tell the story in the first place. Perhaps they would have compensated by becoming “hard or quarrelsome”, as Richard worries about Camilla. Tartt’s characters are often working against a very ancient idea of fate, a dark thread set out for them to follow that they cannot divide themselves from. Undoubtedly, her clean, masterful novels would clutter quickly if you added the structural forces of misogyny alongside the divine.

All the same, sometimes I wonder about the Tartt heroines we could have had. What if The Secret History was about five feral girls and their token boy instead, drinking gin straight and lying to the FBI in white linen and pince-nez, translating Greek to Latin and chasing after Dionysian mysteries? What if a female Theo Decker lost her mother too young and became a charming, girlish liar with an opiate addiction, a tendency towards panic attacks, and a sexily complicated relationship with her criminal best friend?

Given the deeply thrumming awareness of women and narrative possibility that guides Tartt’s work, it’s hard to feel particularly worried. She produces a novel once every decade. I have hope for a heroine yet.

You have to destroy them.” This scene from Lady Hamilton, with Laurence Olivier as Nelson and Vivien Leigh as his eponymous mistress, was allegorical, since the film was made in 1941 to serve as propaganda as another pint-sized menace stalked Europe. The intriguing suggestion in Churchill and the Movie Mogul (BBC Four) was that this scene was written by the former as Britain once more stood alone against a megalomaniac foe. Britain’s wartime leader opened a new front in the cinema to encourage Americans to join the fight to defeat Hitler.

Lady Hamilton’s director, the Hungarian Jewish émigré Alexander Korda, had already been dispatched to Hollywood to make the British sympathetic to Americans. Tough gig. Britain in 1941 still had its imperial boot on the throats of millions of colonials – a fact that led Americans, such as the influential Chicago Tribune publisher Robert R McCormick, to argue it would be better if British imperialism not German fascism got its comeuppance in the second world war.

The FBI boss, J Edgar Hoover, received a memo arguing that Korda was making not so much entertainment as propaganda. Gee, you think? Korda was even hauled before a senate committee for a proto-McCarthyite grilling on his allegedly un-American activities. We heard audio from the hearing at which an unnamed senator laid into Korda’s 1939 film The Four Feathers, damning the movie about a British coward turned hero in the imperial conflict against the Mahdi in Sudan for being “all pip-pip and tawny port and a thin red line of heroes”.

It was a shame we didn’t hear Korda’s reply to this critique. But in a sense it didn’t matter: the film was a smash in the US, making Americans feel sympathy for their former colonial masters even as it depicted what that senator called “the ancient British sport of knocking off the natives”.

Hitler had Leni Riefenstahl, the suggestion went; we had Korda. How striking that it took a refugee from Hungary to win Britain’s propaganda war. Not only did he produce wartime movies, but he later provided cover to MI6 agents working in Europe by pretending they were employed by his company, London Films. It is worth thinking about whenever someone suggests there are too many refugees in the UK. In 1942, he was knighted by Churchill.

But why did the two become friends? This film suggests that both men were establishment outsiders. You could overstate this. After all, Korda was a refugee from the antisemitic persecution of Admiral Horthy’s regime, while Churchill was born in that well-known shtetl, Blenheim Palace. But the facts that his mother was American and that, by 1934, he was in the political wilderness, helped him feel simpatico with Korda. As for Korda, he reinvented himself in his friend’s image; he even smoked Churchill’s brand of cigars to complete the effect.

Korda signed up Churchill in 1934 to write two screenplays for £10,000. He realised Churchill’s literary gift was essentially visual; his speeches are unmade movies, argued critic David Thomson. Consider the fast-edited montage of this speech: “We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.” That said, the screenplays Churchill wrote were never made into films.

Let us not go overboard on what these two did for the war effort. What swung the US into joining the war was not the movies, but the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.

The English exceptionalism these two men pioneered, though, is still with us. Today, that scene from Lady Hamilton has a new resonance as an allegory of Brexit. Johnson and that other gimcrack Churchill, Nigel Farage, suppose themselves leaders of a heroic England that stands alone again (no offence Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but you don’t belong in this rhetorical nonsense), facing down pip-squeak continentals. The myth of splendid, indomitable isolation was always dubious, but never more ridiculous than in 2019."

It is called the Hourglass, because time is running out – and because the XR logo kind of looks like one, in the right light – and comes with the strapline: “Rigorous journalism for fragile times”. More than 110,000 copies will be distributed, printed on paper made from freshly felled Amazonian trees … No, of course not, it’s recycled, most probably from litter picked up from events that didn’t even have anything to do with Extinction Rebellion, but which they attended to pick up litter because they’re better people than the rest of us.

According to a press release, readers can expect stories similar to those of “a mainstream newspaper like the Metro while at times hitting the tone of Take a Break”. “I never knew I had a twin sister until we chained ourselves to the same pink boat in Oxford Circus,” perhaps?

Anyway, we don’t have to guess because, as a well-established mainstream print journalist, I’ve got my hands on a copy to appraise. “I’m Sorry: We Were Wrong” is the headline on the splash, a piece about how scientists are warning that the climate crisis is developing faster than predicted. Inside there are pieces – mostly with the byline “Anonymous” – about threatened species; a leaked report about catastrophic human displacement; unprecedented Arctic fires; the crisis in the Amazon. I’m not getting a lot of Take a Break, to be honest.

Elsewhere, there is a first-person piece by a musician who went to prison for train-surfing the Docklands Light Railway, and a powerful letter from a young woman to her potential future child: “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t do enough to save you.”

Too much, too bleak? Perhaps. But there is respite, with comedy letters, edited by the polarising (spoof) news reporter Jonathan Pie, and some music reviews, because a burning world still needs a cool soundtrack. There is also an interesting, thoughtful interview with Ray Mears. Cartoons and illustrations, too – I like the one of a smoke detector with a snooze button.

But print, though? Seriously? I thought there were some young people in Extinction Rebellion – can’t they just make something pop up on my phone? Who is this for? “People who are not necessarily on social media,” they say. “And who still read and trust traditional press.” And who might not have the energy to glue themselves to a bridge. Really, though, Extinction Rebellion: The Newspaper is worth a look, striking that all-important balance between horror and optimism. Come on, it’s important, buy a copy – except you don’t have to, it’s free!"

The more you write and play, the better you get. Which makes Tegan and Sara’s decision to re-record songs they wrote in high school for their new album Hey, I’m Just Like You rather remarkable. Most people would have shunted this stuff out of sight, never to be mentioned again. It’s unfair, of course, to judge an artist on their juvenilia, the music they made before they settled on their eventual course. But it can be enlightening, too – to see both their immaturity and their precocity, and try to locate threads they would later expand on.

Dr Dre

It’s strange to think of a man who has been a central figure in hip-hop for decades as part of the pack, rather than ahead of it. But long before his solo stardom, before he launched the careers of Eminem and Snoop, before he became the hottest producer in the world, he was wearing shiny suits at the back of the stage, manning the turntables – and sometimes rapping – with World Class Wreckin’ Cru, an electro outfit who were local stars in Compton. Dre even had a theme song, Surgery (“Calling Dr Dre to surgery”), in which he rapped, clunkily: “I’m Dr Dre, gorgeous hunk of a man / Doing tricks on the mix that no others can / The nurses say I’m cute, they say I’m fine / But you better beware ’cause I’ll blow your mind.” Except there’s nothing mind-blowing about the Cru’s two albums, World Class (1985) and Rapped in Romance (86). They’re generic electro, already out of date compared with the music coming from the east coast – Run DMC, LL Cool J, Mantronix, Schoolly D. Dre wouldn’t sound outdated for long.

David Bowie

Few artists have offered quite as much juvenilia to the world as Bowie. There was the R&B phase, with the King Bees and the Manish Boys, then his trying-to-be-the-Who phase, with the Lower Third, all of whom made recordings (all perfectly reasonable, and perfectly unremarkable), before he became your actual David Bowie. But not the actual David Bowie the world came to adore. There was freakbeat Bowie (Do Anything You Say), seaside special Bowie (I Dig Everything), before the first Bowie iteration that stuck: whimsical, Anthony Newley-esque David Bowie, who recorded the single The Laughing Gnome, then a self-titled album for Deram. And despite its status as the embarrassing, stunted relative of the Bowie catalogue, it’s actually a pretty good album. It’s very much of its time, but even if it didn’t have Bowie’s name on the cover, there’d be collectors seeking it out as a prime piece of English psych whimsy. Just pretend it’s by someone called Mrs Marmalade’s Tea Party and it sounds wholly charming. And treasure the Kenneth Williams impression on We Are Hungry Men.

Beastie Boys

The Beastie Boys tend to look back in shame on their first hip-hop album, Licensed to Ill, but it wasn’t some sidestep into wilful stupidity. Before becoming a wilfully stupid hip-hop group, they’d been a wilfully stupid teenage hardcore punk band: in his compendious survey American Hardcore, even Steven Blush – who can compliment almost any hardcore band, no matter how rudimentary – calls them “puerile”. Nor were they popular on the scene: Sean Taggart, who designed covers and flyers for hardcore bands, called them “effete little shits – a very snotty, elitist bunch”. You can hear their manifest musical inadequacies on the early-years compilation Some Old Bullshit – which also contains their first, pre-Def Jam attempts at hip-hop, and the pastiche reggae (complete with “Jamaican” accents) of Beastie Revolution. There is not one second of this album to suggest they would become one of pop’s best-loved and most-admired groups.

Björk

It’s hard to know which piece of Björk juvenilia to avoid first. In 1977, she became one of the rare future art superstars to make a record while still, unarguably, a child – I Love to Love was recorded when she was 11, released when she was 12. And if tinny pop, designed to be listened to at the worst disco in the world – held in a church hall haunted by the smell of vomited-up Fanta and dust undisturbed for decades – is your bag, then be my guest. There was still a long way to go before adult Björk arrived. Her warped but melodic new-wave band Tappi Tíkarrass (who released an EP in 1982, and an album in 1983) were often good – and her voice is already amazing – but you’ve got to get through KUKL before you get to the Sugarcubes. It’s still music for church halls, but now the smell is patchouli, unwashed fabric and spilt cider, because the kid who threw up the Fanta is now a living in a squat and putting on anti-vivisection benefits.

Katy Perry

Sixteen-year-old Katheryn Hudson was possessed of a belting voice and a faith instilled in her by her deeply religious parents (her mother wouldn’t let her eat Lucky Charms because Lucky sounded too much like “Lucifer”). She’d been singing in church since she was nine, so it seemed only natural for her to make a Christian record. Her album Katy Hudson sometimes gets called gospel, but it’s not. It’s blandly efficient MOR – “Christian Contemporary Music” – differentiated from drivetime radio staples only by the fact that the subject of her passion isn’t a man, but Him Upstairs. You can hear that Perry has something; you can also hear that she was never likely to be constrained by the CCM format, since she always seems to want to be doing more than the songs will allow. A few missteps later, though, and she was kissing a girl, which she apparently liked. Goodness knows what God thought.

Mick Hucknall

“I feel like the ’unchback of Notre Dame / I’m an ugly sod but it’s not my fault.” The Hunchback of Notre Dame was one of the five tracks in the first session the Frantic Elevators recorded for John Peel, broadcast on 3 March 1981. The gruff voice barking out those lyrics belonged to Mick Hucknall, not yet 21, but already a veteran of Manchester’s punk and post-punk scene (the Elevators formed, as did every other group in Manchester after Herman’s Hermits, fresh from seeing the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in June 1976). There’s little in their handful of singles, their pair of Peel sessions or the few pieces of extant film to suggest that anything other than fondly remembered obscurity awaited – until their final single, written in 1978 but not recorded and released until 1982. In Holding Back the Years, suddenly, the fact that there was an extraordinary melodicist and fabulous singer in the band became glaringly apparent.

Bobby Brown

The “Michael Jackson” in Boston’s pre-adolescent answer to the Jackson 5, New Edition, Brown formed the group himself when he was nine, in 1978. They signed to Arthur Baker’s Streetwise Records in 1982, and promptly had a massive hit on both sides of the Atlantic with Candy Girl. Even 37 years later, that single – on which Brown sang co-lead – is a delightful piece of bubblegum R&B (albeit one so indebted to the Jacksons that it might have been called DEF). Brown was a troubled kid, though, and got thrown out of the group in 1985 owing to his behaviour. He would never again sound innocent the way he did on his three albums with New Edition.

Alanis Morissette

Jagged Little Pill in 1995 wasn’t Alanis Morissette’s emergence, fully formed, into the world. It was, as much as anything, a reaction to the experience of being a teen star, albeit only in Canada. She had made two hit albums – Alanis and Now Is the Time – and won several Juno awards. While she co-wrote across both of them, the sense remained of someone being moulded to fit a record label’s idea of what a teenage singer should be: “My name is Alanis, I’m just 16 / So gimme a break / I’m no disco queen,” she sang on Oh Yeah, from her debut. The first record was dance-pop, the second a little more grown-up (and less successful), and you can hear a voice that is a thousand times better than, say, that of Tiffany or Debbie Gibson; on The Time of Your Life, from Now Is the Time, you can hear the phrasing and delivery of Jagged Little Pill falling into place. But there was darkness to it all. Morrissette later said she was put under such pressure to lose weight that she developed anorexia, and took years to overcome her eating disorders. That confusion would tumble out on Jagged Little Pill.

Marc Bolan

Like Bowie, Bolan spent much of the 1960s trying to work out how to become himself. And, like Bowie, he left behind plenty of recorded evidence of his voyage of self-discovery: The Wizard and the Third Degree are zippy enough; Hippy Gumbo prefigures Tyrannosaurus Rex. But things got interesting when Bolan joined the mod-psych band John’s Children in 1967. His two best-known songs for them – much celebrated and oft-compiled – are genuinely brilliant. Midsummer Night’s Scene is both haunted and hammering, the sound of purple hearts and blotter acid at the same time (the style that later got named “freakbeat”); Desdemona was banned by the BBC for the lyric “lift up your skirt and fly”. As Rob Chapman wrote in Psychedelia and Other Colours: “Bolan is only let loose at the very end, screaming the chorus line like he has no previous acquaintance with the lyrics or indeed the key he’s supposed to be singing in. He sounds unhinged.”

Neil Young and Rick James

Two for the price of one, because the most contrary man in the history of rock music and the future Super Freak shared stages together in the mid-60s as part of the Mynah Birds, the best Toronto R&B/soul band to be signed to Motown, albeit in a field of one. It wasn’t really Young’s metier – he was already singing folk when roped in to play guitar – and the band fell apart in 1966 when James was sentenced to five months’ hard labour for going Awol from the US navy (his issues with the navy are a long and fascinating story). Though nothing was released at the time (it emerged later on compilations), the Mynah Birds did get round to recording for Motown before their career was derailed, and the music is worth hearing, for its berserk variety: I’ll Wait Forever is pure folk-rock; I Got You (In My Soul) is stomping garage R&B; It’s My Time, the gem, is beautiful, ecstatic soul, but with a Byrdsy guitar line. What a strange, compelling group they might have become."

Adventurous writer-director Caspar Seale Jones has relocated a stock horror starting point – fraught young woman fleeing something abominable in her past – to Japan, which instantly gifts his frames more distinctive vistas than all those potboilers pursuing teenagers through the streets of Peterborough or Stroud. More intriguingly, To Tokyo is in that Japanese folk-horror tradition that yielded Onibaba and Kwaidan, making merry-macabre use of a still relatively unfamiliar set of demons and ghouls.

To Tokyo scores high on dreamy-bordering-on-nightmarish atmosphere. On learning her mother is gravely ill, Alice (Florence Kosky) passes into either a fugue state or an actual wilderness that encompasses forests, deserts and a mountainside hut where she slaps on warpaint and receives offerings of fruit and entrails from whatever dragged her there. For half its running time, To Tokyo is just Kosky, some spectacular landscapes (cinematographer Ralph Messer apparently taking notes from that visual whizz Tarsem Singh) and a properly creepy spectre. Seale Jones makes the bold, rewarding decision not to explain a damn thing. The result is a masterclass in show-don’t-tell cinema.

Even when Alice reaches the bright lights of Tokyo, the depopulated backstreets and coldly indifferent skyscrapers are eerie and unsettling: it’s as though what came before was a dry run for the worst civilisation has to offer. Any interpretation will be yours, but there’s a fairytale logic to it, and the action is anchored by Seale Jones’s remarkably assured image-making and a performance of intense hollow-eyed persistence by Kosky.

Self-evidently a first feature – running to just 75 minutes – it nevertheless serves as a striking and effective calling card. How encouraging it is to see an emergent British film-maker reaching for the uncanny and mysterious, rather than settling for hackneyed or humdrum.

• To Tokyo is released in the UK on 27 September."

One girl wanted to talk to him about his song Two of Us , which he had written after the death of his mother. The girl had lost her dad, and wanted the singer to know how much his lyrics had meant to her. He’d never had that in his band One Direction, he says. “We wrote cool songs, but they were love songs. It only goes so far, and to have someone say that I could help them with my …” He pauses. “It blows my mind, that shit. I was proper proud.”

It has been a hard few years. Tomlinson’s mother died in 2016, just as he was about to launch his first solo single. In March this year, his 18-year-old sister was found unconscious at her flat in London and couldn’t be revived. We will come to that, but, professionally, Tomlinson was struggling too. One Direction – that supernova of a boy band – broke up in 2015. Or announced they were taking a break. Or “‘hiatus’ or whatever word we use”, he says with a smile.

At the time, Tomlinson, now 27, was finding his place as a songwriter. “I wasn’t singing a lot, I wasn’t the frontman. Without being a sorry little bastard, I thought: ‘How do I do better, how do I make something of myself, an identity?’” In the last 18 months of One Direction, he says, “I felt like I knew who I was in the band, and I felt a real worth for who I was.” The break up, he says, “rocked me. I wasn’t ready for it. I felt like I was getting to be a better songwriter, singer, a more confident performer, and all of a sudden, when I felt I was finally getting some momentum …”

We meet at a bar in north London. Tomlinson greets me with a hug as if I am one of his fans (I am not, particularly, although I am by the end). He seems open but not vulnerable, and more self-aware and modest than you would expect from a man who was once part of the biggest boy band in the world. He is friendly and relaxed, dressed in a black tracksuit, with a beer in front of him.

Tomlinson’s personal tragedies also meant his solo career has had a bit of a stop-start quality, but now it looks as if there is focus and momentum. He released his single Kill My Mind earlier this month; an album will follow next year. Kill My Mind is an indie-pop delight, not so huge a departure as to alienate his fanbase, but it sounds like the music he grew up listening to – Oasis and Arctic Monkeys – and his South Yorkshire accent brings more than a hint of Liam Gallagher-style northern vocals. He sounds confident on them, more so than on the previous singles he put out, a couple of fairly forgettable collaborations. “I think, in hindsight, that was me trying to find my place in the industry and making music I thought I had to make to get on radio.

“I had this epiphany when I was thinking about the music I grew up with,” he continues. “I kind of had a bit of a word with myself and worked out what I want – to be happy and proud of what I’m doing. I love those early singles, but I never really felt proud of them, because it didn’t feel too true to me.”

As a child, growing up in Doncaster with his mum Johannah, who raised him alone until she married Tomlinson’s stepfather, he loved performing. “I liked to be the class clown, I liked to make people laugh, to show off, all that.” When his younger twin sisters were cast on TV dramas, he would sometimes go along as their chaperone, earning £30. “Where I’m from, we don’t have anyone who’s been on TV or anything like that, so it was super-exciting,” he says. He ended up picking up work as an extra. “The pinnacle of my acting career was one line on an ITV drama. I don’t even know if they used my scene,” he says with a laugh.

When he was 15, he joined a drama group in Barnsley, which his mum would take him to when she could afford it. “I think I was confused, thinking I wanted to act when actually what I wanted to do was perform.”

At school he joined a band, where they sang Oasis and Green Day covers, and when The X Factor came up, he made it on to the show in 2010 on his third attempt. He queued from 3am to make sure the producers wouldn’t have audition fatigue before they saw him, and he got his goal – to get in front of Simon Cowell “and just have a professional opinion on how I am as a singer. I was so flustered. Going from school performances to performing in front of professionals, TV cameras, a 3,000-strong audience. I wasn’t present. I sang terribly. I remember coming away from it thinking: ‘I wonder if I’ve got through as one of those lads who looks all right but isn’t really a good singer.’”

Yet he ended up in One Direction, the band the show put together in its 2010 series. For six years they sold tens of millions of records, broke America and each made a rumoured £40m-plus fortune. Their fans, Directioners, are another level of devoted. I don’t know how he coped with the attention, or the pressure.

There were really only a few times when it got too much, says Tomlinson. They were in Australia and a local news station had got a helicopter and a photographer was trying to get pictures of Tomlinson in his top-floor hotel room. “I think I was naked, or just in my boxers, and even in my hotel room there was no escape. I could feel the pressure.” He tweeted about it – “your standard bratty celebrity tweet” – and was attacked. “At times it did stress me out but never was I allowed to whinge, allowed to be a human and say: ‘Today has got too much for me.’ I found that difficult at first.”

But he is keen not to sound as if he is complaining. “There was much more positive that outweighed that.” And he never blames the fans for their intensity. Theirs is a special relationship, he says. “So many people have bullshitted about what they feel about the fans, but they’re like family to me.”

Even when Directioners have got a bit too ardent – there is a conspiracy theory, for example, that he and his bandmate Harry Styles have long been in a secret sexual relationship – he seems more bemused by it than annoyed. Although he is wary, he says, of adding “fuel to the fire” by talking about it. “I know, culturally, it’s interesting, but I’m just a bit tired of it,” he says. The HBO drama Euphoria recently showed an animated sequence of Tomlinson and Styles together, as imagined by a smutty fan-fiction writer. Was it annoying that a show had taken something fairly niche and given it new mainstream life? “Again, I get the cultural intention behind that. But I think …” He trails off, trying to work out what he wants to say. “It just felt a little bit … No, I’m not going to lie, I was pissed off. It annoyed me that a big company would get behind it.”

Why does he think he never went off the rails during the band’s heady period? “My mates and my family, really. It’s from my upbringing and where I come from. If I went back to Doncaster and I was dripping in Gucci or whatever, I’d probably get whacked. I’m always very conscious of not acting too big for my boots. It’s the people around me who keep me sane and normal, because they give me insight into real life.” He lives with his girlfriend, Eleanor and his best friend, Oli. “Some celebrities, in pop in particular, only surround themselves with amazingness, and all they see is good, good, good, which is lovely, but you don’t understand the real world then. I have the luxury of my mates around me, just reminding me how fucking good I’ve got it, really.”

The day of One Direction’s final concert in November 2015, Tomlinson and his bandmate Niall Horan sat together “and had a little cry, because it was such a journey we had been on. That day in general was so poignant. As much as you try and prepare yourself, it’s a whole other thing when it comes.” Because they had worked so much with few days off, he assumed that a break would be exciting. “But it wasn’t like that. When you’re used to working however many days, it’s all that more evident when you’re not doing something. Especially in the first six months.” He spent time in Los Angeles with his son, who was born in 2016, after his relationship with a stylist, Briana Jungwirth. “My life became –and I don’t mean this to sound derogatory – very normal, from being a life of pure craziness.”

At the same time that Tomlinson was trying to work out what to do with himself, his mother, to whom he was intensely close, had been diagnosed with leukaemia; she died in December 2016. He performed his first single on The X Factor just a few days after her death, then seemed to half-heartedly continue with his solo career, releasing another single in 2017. It would be another two years – during which he became a judge on The X Factor – before he released Two of Us, a raw and beautiful (and under-rated) song.

“After I lost my mum, every song I wrote felt, not pathetic, but that it lacked true meaning to me,” he says. “I felt that, as a songwriter, I wasn’t going to move on until I’d written a song like that.” He knew he needed to get it out of him, but there was a lot of pressure – he felt he should be an experienced songwriter before he attempted it. Two songwriters he worked with played him the chorus. “It was like the song I always wished I’d written. I went in and put my personal touch to the verses. It was a real moment for me in my grief, and as part of the creative process, because it felt like it was hanging over me.”

Earlier this month, an inquest found that his sister Félicité had died of an accidental overdose; she had been taking drugs, including anxiety medication, since the death of their mother. He has been through some terrible times, I say, which must put a perspective on a pop career. “Exactly,” he says, a little quieter than before. “That whole dark side I’ve gone through, it sounds stupid to say, but it gives me strength everywhere else in my life, because that’s the darkest shit that I’m going to have to deal with. So it makes everything else, not feel easier and not less important, but, in the grand scheme of things, you see things for what they are, I suppose.”

His fans have been crucial, he says. “I’m sure every artist says this, but I do believe it. We’ve been through some dark times together and those things I’ve been through, they carry a weight, emotionally, on the fans as well. And I felt their love and support. I remember really clearly when I lost my mum, that support was mad.”

What have the experiences of loss he has been through taught him about himself? He thinks for a second. “I keep going back to it, but I don’t know if it’s a combination of where I grew up and my mum’s influence, but I just have this luxury of being able to see the glass half-full no matter what.” He is the oldest of his mother’s seven children, which is grounding and means, he says, “there’s no time for me to be sat feeling sorry for myself. I’ve been to rock bottom and I feel like, whatever my career’s going to throw in front of me, it’s going to be nothing as big or as emotionally heavy as that. So, weirdly, I’ve turned something that’s really dark into something that empowers me, makes me stronger.”

He gets up to go to the toilet, which I think is his polite way of asking me to move on, although when he gets back he says, by way of a final word on the matter, “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me. That’s not how I feel for myself. Somehow it fuels me.”

One Direction will get back together one day, he believes. He still speaks to the others. “We’re not texting each other every day, but what we do have, which will never go away, is this real brothership. We’ve had these experiences that no one else can relate to.”

Styles has become quite the superstar. The others seem to have steady solo careers. Tomlinson says he’s embarrassed to admit that, when he first went solo, he would have been devastated had his album “only” reached No 3, so used is he to everything he did with One Direction going to the top. Is it hard not to measure himself against his former bandmates? “Oh, naturally,” he says. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t. I’ve never been competitive like that, but, naturally, you think: ‘If they’re getting this then I deserve that.’ I think, the longer time goes on, I can see it for what it is and just be proud of them.” And success means something else to him now. “It means I’m happy with what I’m doing.”

Famed for his mouth-watering food shots and on-the-money restaurant recommendations (warning, don’t scroll when hungry), who better to talk us through the delights of brunching? Here’s what he has to say…

Brunch is definitely better than breakfast.

“To me, brunch is a real celebration of the weekend. Everybody wakes up a little later and it’s a really relaxed way to spend time with friends without wasting an entire day (long, drawn-out lunches can go on forever). Everybody is more friendly during brunch service, too – it’s not as rushed and waiters are less frazzled.”

Views can make or break a meal.

“One of my favourite brunch spots is Duck and Waffle – on the 40th floor of London’s Heron Tower. Enjoy incredible 360-degree views of the city – you really feel on top of the world when the sun is shining. My best tip is to get the table in the corner – you get dual-aspect views that way. Their dishes are great for sharing – I love the ‘full Elvis’ (waffles with peanut butter, jam, chantilly cream and caramelised bananas). Their cocktails are really innovative – the Grey Goose Breakfast Fizz is very breakfast-friendly, with a hint of marmalade and burnt toast.”

Cocktails are always a good idea. Unlimited cocktails are even better.

“Bottomless brunches are great for a celebratory occasion like a friend’s birthday. If the price is pre-set and the drinks are free-flowing, everyone can just have a fun, communal and fuss-free dining experience. I really enjoy fresh-tasting cocktails, and I’m a big fan of Grey Goose Vodka with Japanese yuzu – a citrus fruit unlike any other, it has a very distinct aroma and flavour, perhaps similar to a cross between a grapefruit and lime … but better! I also like tea-infused cocktails – jasmine and Earl Grey tea-infused cocktails are brilliant for brunch.”

I like my eggs sunny side up.

“I love fried eggs to be crispy on the outside with an oozing yolk, but I also really like very slow-cooked scrambled eggs with plenty of butter, Bill Granger-style. For a real people-pleaser and great eggs, Cecconi’s do a really good full English with an Italian twist – their Tuscan sausages are delicious. The decor, service and cocktails are spot-on, so it’s a great spot to take parents or in-laws. You can’t go wrong with a classic Bloody Mary to pair with fried eggs – I prefer mine extra spicy with freshly grated horseradish – a match made in heaven!”

But, believe it or not, eggs aren’t compulsory.

“Another of my favourite spots is Kaia at the Ned. Kaia is Asian Pacific-inspired and does amazing Hawaiian poke bowls with deconstructed sushi, avocado flowers and sushi rice, served with marinated tuna or sashimi-grade salmon – it makes for a really delicious, healthy brunch. Don’t leave without trying their gyoza dumplings and okonomiyaki omelette, but the best bit is their Bloody Mary – the Umami Mary. They use Grey Goose vodka and sansho pepper for extra zing.”

I’m a pancakes-with-bacon guy, personally.

“Or waffles. I like that sweet and savoury ‘umami’ taste. I have a sweet tooth, so berries and maple syrup is always good. Usually I’ll suggest everybody orders a few dishes to share – or we get pancakes for the table to finish. Anywhere that has avocado, pancakes, waffles or crispy bacon on the menu gets a thumbs-up from me. I love an Espresso Martini with my pancakes. Sometimes I will go for one with a Middle Eastern twist, adding cardamom and orange blossom water to give it a delicious warming flavour.”

Kebabs for brunch are a thing, too.

“Le Bab is a modern gourmet kebab restaurant and it’s the perfect hangover cure – everything comes with the most incredible sauces. Try a Middle-Eastern style brunch: I love the shakshuka – eggs baked in tomatoes and peppers – which goes perfectly with a Grey Goose Vodka and Elderflower Tonic. Or for something a little fancier, try its sister restaurant, Maison Le Bab. It’s beautifully designed and slightly more grownup (have a cocktail at the bar if you get there early).”

Photos are fine, but be discreet.

“For the best pictures, go for a table by the window with lots of natural light – direct sunlight is too harsh. If the food is beautiful, you don’t need to do much. Some bloggers like super close-ups of one dish, or one from above, or the 45-degree angle shot which is more ‘3D’. Don’t use flash or annoy other diners though – try to be discreet. And enjoy your food while it’s hot!”

Don’t rule out brunch at home.

“Sometimes when you roll out of bed there’s nothing better than cooking a great brunch in your own surroundings – my partner loves it when we recreate that brunch vibe in our PJs, with the sun shining. Sometimes I’ll make cocktails at home – we love Espresso Martinis as they’re a great twist on that much-needed coffee in the morning. They’re really easy to make, too.”

… but get the ingredients right.

“When it comes to brunch at home, good eggs are a must – I like Burford Browns with really orange yolks. We have some great butchers near us for amazing sausages and bacon (I like streaky and smoked bacon) but if you’re veggie, some big, juicy portobello mushrooms, roasted with thyme and butter, are really delicious. Making a crisp, bubbling hash is a good way to use up leftover food, too.”

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.

Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.

If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it; crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.

Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.

Whether you’re hosting a dinner party, or having a quiet night in with your partner, if you keep food and drink simple, the night’s more sociable for you because you’re not breaking your back in the kitchen. And finding the sort of ingredients you need to make great, simple food is easier than ever nowadays. You can track down great independent suppliers and butchers on Instagram, and apps such as Farmdrop do the searching on your behalf, bringing locally sourced, sustainable ingredients, grown by people who really care about quality, to you – and when you buy direct from the source, you’re putting more money in the suppliers’ hands.

Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.

This stuff isn’t the food I serve at work. This is how I cook for myself. And whether you’re making food for 15 people or just for you, when you’re at home, you don’t have to cook like a professional. For quite a few years, we’ve been saying to the public: “You should be making more things at home” – and yes you should, but there’s no reason to make things more complex than they ought to be. So next time you’re stocking up for a party, a romantic night in or a solo dinner, put your effort into finding the best ingredients and the highest-quality cocktails. Then, 75% of the job is done, leaving you to enjoy your company – even if it’s just your own company. Win-win.

Whether she’s getting real about being a working mum, tweeting about Love Island or joking about finding the perfect Dirty Martini (more on that later), there’s one thing that can be said about musician and podcaster Jessie Ware: she’s refreshingly relatable.

Frank, funny and a little self-deprecating, at 34 Ware admits that she has finally managed to let go of her troublesome 20s, and start to fully love life. “You spend your 20s and teens – more my 20s for me – filled with neuroses and stressing, but my 30s are different,” she says.

“Life feels really good, I am living victoriously at the moment – I feel so much more comfortable in my 30s. You bed in and you work out your priorities; you pick those times when you have your Dirty Martini and you pick the times when you go to bed early. I feel really centred and like there are so many worlds opening up to me.”

It’s not just the way Ware feels about herself that has changed in the past decade, how she socialises has too, meaning that she now finds joy in the smaller, subtler moments which highlight the quality of her friendships.

“I would love to still party with my girlfriends like 2007-2009; even though one has got a baby and one is with child. We all text each other about going on this big night out, it’s really fun fantasising about it. I’d go where Benji B was playing, he’s a great DJ, he plays great tunes.”

As a working mum, Ware admits that it hasn’t always been easy. Juggling a multifaceted day job, as well as two children under three – she has, at times, put pressure on herself to be perfect.

“I was so keen to prove to myself that I could do it all and have it all the first time that I nearly sent myself over the edge,” she says. So now she makes sure she has time for socialising, and for celebrations big and small: “My mum is particularly good fun for sharing a Cosmopolitan with. And I feel so lucky that I have such a fun job, that’s even more varied now than just being in music and that’s been so amazing. The fact that we’ve been to Edinburgh to do Table Manners live is quite a ‘pinch me’ moment, but also quite petrifying. It was such an honour to be involved in that, from what started as just a bit of a hobby.”

But how does a woman with so much on her plate find time for herself?

“I usually rely on other people to help me out to be able to take time for myself – whether it’s my husband taking the baby or my mum helping out, it takes a village. I can’t do it if I don’t have other people helping me, like when I DJed for Grey Goose and my husband and my nanny tag-teamed me.”

Indeed, she credits her husband, Sam Burrows, whom she married in Skopelos, Greece, in August 2017, for helping her to take time out when she needs it. Especially when it comes to taking a break from her phone. “My husband is really good,” she says. “He’s always berating me for being on my phone because I’m glued to it. Whether it’s working or telephone calls or social media, sometimes it takes him to remind me to be in the present. I’d like to be more spontaneous. But I always have to have a plan, I love a schedule.

“I’m not very good at taking moments for myself, so I find the way that I actually feel that I can escape everything is cooking. I love it. I like to do things that are as hassle-free as possible but with lots of flavour, something that won’t take forever but requires me to switch off for like half an hour. Thirty-minute, impressive meals that actually haven’t taken huge amounts of work.”

Little wonder then that her perfect day would be spent with her family and friends, enjoying the small moments. “I’d attempt a lie in and we would sit in bed with all the family and put music on and have tea and toast.

“My perfect day would revolve around eating. My husband can’t understand how I can get so excited about eggs, or why I should be so excited about paying a ridiculous amount for a poached egg. I love it. We’d go somewhere delicious for breakfast, probably Esters in Stoke Newington and then I’d go to the Towpath for lunch – that place is the most popular place in the world. I’d go in the week when all the locals are having their catch-ups. And then we’d have a good walk. Then I’d have the most perfect Grey Goose Dirty Martini as a sundowner – don’t scrimp on the olive juice.”

Ware in the World …

The city break …

“Lisbon is amazing, I played there last year and we had a few days off after. You can get the best seafood, the people are gorgeous and it’s so romantic.”

Favourite cocktail spot

“Gloria in Shoreditch was good fun, everyone’s been Instagramming it. I went there on a girls’ date, but I think it would be really good for a proper date.”

Favourite cocktail

“The Grey Goose Dirty Martini. My mum is someone who really knows how to make one. And she’s taught me [See recipe below]. Go really grimey.”

The songwriting spot …

“LA – even though I never get a good song there! It’s all about the palm trees and the sea view, I love it.”

The place to people watch …

“Paris is the best. They’ve got the right seating in the cafes so you can chill and look out. And the Towpath in Hackney, even if there are always passive-aggressive cyclists passing ringing their bells.”

We’ve certainly been talking about it for long enough – ever since women joined the labour force en masse in the 1960s and 1970s, the fashion industry has been pushing the holy grail of sartorial flexibility. Take Diane von Furstenberg’s iconic wrap dress: elegant enough for a business meeting, yet still feminine enough to work for a date after hours. Indeed, we’ve been musing over it so long, you might presume it’s something you couldn’t get wrong. Strange then, that even after a career of 15 years in clothes as an editor on various style magazines, I’ve often made mistakes.

A jumpsuit is a quintessential day-to-night option

There is nothing worse than the feeling of being in your slightly clammy daytime duds, and finding yourself in a fancy bar or restaurant as the night has unexpectedly continued an hour or two after your usual curfew. These days, I’ve realised it’s just worth being prepared for all eventualities. I’m not talking about dragging a wheelie bag of style options with you every time you leave the house, more dressing for the happy surprises that can turn what started out as a lunch rendezvous into a night of cocktails and late-night revelry. In my well-seasoned experience, the best nights, always, always start out as innocuous diary dates and suddenly ramp up into an accidental celebration – whether it’s the joy of spending time with an old friend or the excitement of finding a hot new spot for drinks. So it’s best to make sure all style bases are covered.

Make sure all style bases are covered

While my spontaneity may have been somewhat clipped by recent motherhood, generally I’ve found that living in the city means you never know entirely what’s in store when you walk out the door. I can leave the house at 8:30am, then at 5pm get invited to an upscale do without time for the round-trip home. On another day I can connect with an old colleague for a post-work cocktail, remember how much I love her company and suddenly a short catch up has turned into an unexpected night of bar hopping and twirling on the dancefloor. It’s just the nature of city life, and one of the things I love the most about being an urbanite. But you can’t deny that it plays havoc with your fashion game.

Don’t let the spontaneity of city life play havoc with your fashion game

When it comes to deciding what to wear, it’s all in the mix. Of course jeans can work from day to night, but it’s the cut and how the style makes you feel that matters – it’s not about the exact fit. I have a favourite pair of straight boyfriend jeans which I wear at weekends to fanny about at the local farmers’ market while carrying a straw basket. They are cut in the perfect Jennifer-Aniston-early-noughties denim and I feel really cool in them. But that’s on a Sunday … at the farmers’ market. If I were wearing them in an elegant restaurant, I would feel rubbish. It is often purely psychological. For me personally, the best day-to-night jean combos have a touch of polish. I’d wear a vintage fit high-waisted jean with a silk vest and blazer, for example. Or a top that showcases the clavicle – either Bardot style or racer cut – and add a belt to define the waist.

One of the most important factors in day-to-night success is your footwear choice. While no one wants to be tottering around in 120mm pumps for brunch, if you feel – as I do – that you need a little lift for night-time confidence, stepping out in sneakers may be an error. My number one choice is a simple two-strap 1.5-inch block heel. Subtly dressing any look up, they don’t make you feel excessively “done”.

One of the most important factors in day-to-night success is your footwear choice

Aside from the wrap dress, there are other failsafes. A jumpsuit is a quintessential day-to-night option; a day dress in a colourful or printed fabric; a silk pyjama blouse with denim. There are also tiny twists that you can use to inject after-dark appeal on the fly. Carry gold hoop earrings, a bold lipstick (I always have a chalky red on me) or a smoky eye palette with a glint of sparkle. If your hair has a tendency to go frizzy or limp through the day, don’t ever be without a few kirby grips and elastic bands, or bring along a barette or clip to up the ante. My preferred bag choice remains a crossbody mini, with enough space for wallet, phone, keys and makeup essentials. And as a final note, remember, 24-hour dressing is all in the attitude. Only you know you’ve been in your look since 8am, so never let your outfit stop you from following the night – wherever it takes you.

Dries Van Noten, 61, founded his label in 1986 and has been a cornerstone of fashion week in Paris ever since. His vibrantly coloured, intricately detailed but always wearable clothes have earned him a devoted customer base who have kept him afloat through the vagaries of trends. Christian Lacroix, 68, founded his fashion house one year later, in 1987. His star burned brightly for two decades in which his flamboyant dresses starred on red carpets and magazine covers, until losses forced him to shutter the house in 2009.

Christian Lacroix no longer owns his trademark, and his name has not appeared at fashion week for a decade. The first hint that Dries Van Noten’s show was to be out of the ordinary was the red rose that had been placed on each seat, with a ribbon tag signed DVN*XCLX.

Back when Christian Lacroix staged fashion shows, the audience would throw roses on to the catwalk when he made his bow during the finale, a ritual taken from the bullfights of Lacroix’s native Arles. The setting for this show was straight out of Van Noten’s understated playbook – a minimalist, poured-concrete space at the modernist Opera Bastille – but when the first model appeared, she wore in her hair a large black feather, another tradition remembered from Lacroix’s own fashion shows.

Polka dots were followed by flamenco ruffles, and then a chartreuse opera coat gathered with festoon swagging. There were fuchsia taffeta trousers with waterfall hems. By the time exit 41 appeared – a blood-red matador jacket with gold embroidery – the closely guarded secret of a co-collection was becoming clear. The two men took their bow together at the end of the show.

Van Noten said of the collaboration that he had found himself “needing exuberance, opulence, another volume and fun”.

“I was constantly drawn to the 80s and 90s, to a love of dressing up, to couture, to beauty, to audacity – to joy. I quickly realised that all roads seemed to lead to the work and world - of Mr Christian Lacroix. So I thought why not just phone him, why not phone Christian and ask if he would be up for the challenge and enjoy working with me on a collection. I was so happy when he immediately said yes.”

The two designers, who have spent the past five months working together, stood shoulder to shoulder as they accepted congratulations and posed for photos with their arms around each other. Christian Lacroix, who has had a successful career designing for the opera and ballet in the decade since his last haute couture show, was visibly emotional to be back in the fashion throng.

The cloak-and-dagger secrecy and the surprise “drop” of the collection was a smart trick. Van Noten and Lacroix won the news cycle of fashion week and the stunt ensured that this collaboration will resonate on the social media feeds of millennials for whom the 20th-century glory days of Lacroix are ancient history. And by having the first few outfits pass as Van Noten before the realisation occurred to most of those in the audience, the show illustrated how surprisingly close Van Noten’s more cerebral, Belgian-trained aesthetic is to Lacroix’s flamboyant, Mediterranean-facing maximalism. In their painterly sense of colour and passion for drama in fashion, they are kindred spirits. The collaboration, which is understood to be a one-off for this season, was a celebration of “mutual admiration”, Van Noten’s spokesman said."

Mattel is a 74-year-old company slowly taking on Gen-Z values. The maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels has announced the release of Creatable World, its first series of gender-neutral dolls.

The dolls differ from Mattel’s gendered Barbie and GI Joe dolls in subtle but significant ways. The dolls are a blank slate. No broad shoulders, no full hips, no long lashes. Children of any gender identification are encouraged to play with them.

“Toys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,” Mattel said in a statement on Wednesday. “Through research, we heard that kids don’t want their toys dictated by gender norms. This line allows all kids to express themselves freely.”

It added: “We’re hopeful Creatable World will encourage people to think more broadly about how all kids can benefit from doll play.”

Toy companies are vigorously retooling their products to align with advancements in representation, inclusion and diversity that Gen-Z children – not their millennial parents – are largely responsible for.

Studies examining gender identification among young children are hard to come by, but a recent report by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles found that 27% of California teens surveyed identified as gender-nonconforming to varying extents.

Just this month, numerous conversation-starting toys and board games have come out. Hasbro released a gender-swapped version of Monopoly entitled Ms Monopoly, where women players earn more than men. Meanwhile, Mattel released a slew of culturally diverse Barbies (including a “Día de los Muertos Barbie” that garnered accusations of cultural appropriation).

The response hasn’t been unanimously positive. Hasbro and Mattel have been accused of attempting to profit off culture wars. “There’s already this vibe in the [board] gaming community that anything Monopoly does is a cash-grab,” John “Hex” Carter, a board game designer and consultant, said in an interview with the Guardian last week. “Because the market is already flooded with so many different versions of it. So the motivation behind a game like Ms Monopoly is transparent: to make money.”

Mattel’s gender-neutral doll has won over some in the LGBTQ community. “So many children and parents never saw themselves represented in toys and dolls, but this new line raises the bar for inclusion thanks to input from parents, physicians and children themselves,” the LGBT advocacy group Glaad wrote on Twitter.

Despite the progressiveness of its Creatable World dolls, Mattel is quick to assert itself as apolitical.

“We’re not in the business of politics,” Mattel’s president told Time Magazine, “and we respect the decision any parent makes around how they raise their kids. Our job is to stimulate imaginations. Our toys are ultimately canvases for cultural conversation, but it’s your conversation, not ours; your opinion, not ours.”"

It’s not her actual wedding list – rather, a “collaboration” with Amazon to share “my favourite registry wish-list items”. However, it serves as a handy example of all the random things people think they want these days – things that, frankly, they will use a maximum of once before confining to the back of their cupboards.

A 2017 survey by Skipton building society found the average UK household has more than £1,100 worth of items gathering dust, including exercise bikes, posh crockery and water filters. I am no better – I have an ice-cream maker that has made it through three house moves and still remains unused (at least the toasted sandwich maker gets brought out a few times a year). Even decluttering experts fall into the trap – one of them, Rachel Burditt, confesses to me that she owns a pasta machine she has used only three times. Electronic kitchen gadgets are the most common purchases cast aside, she adds: “Soup makers, breadmakers, NutriBullets.”

And naturally, wedding lists aren’t the only vehicle by which unnecessary stuff finds its way into our homes. Sometimes we buy things that represent the people we want to be – a juicer for that two-week health kick, or cutlery for “best”. “If I do a garage clearout,” says Burditt, “I’m guaranteed to find dumbbells that someone bought 20 years ago that they don’t want to get rid of, just in case.”

But there is another way. In response to the deluge of stuff we live with – all of which, of course, has an effect on the environment – a sharing movement has taken off, such as the Library of Things and Streetbank, where people can borrow a range of items from power tools to camping gear, things that would otherwise be bought but rarely used. Burditt recommends pooling items with family and friends, too. “It’s about understanding what you absolutely need to buy versus what you can buy as an extended family. You don’t have all these things cluttering up your house.” Jennifer, if you’re reading this – lend us your robot mop?"

Guilt-free forage or enough to put you off your dinner?

Deer oh deer: is Janet Street-Porter right to eat roadkill?

Name: Janet Street-Porter.

Age: 72.

Appearance: Striking.

I know who you mean. There’s only one Janet Street-Porter. But what a varied CV: producer, editor, author, broadcaster, journalist …

I’m aware … committed rambler, roadkill enthusiast, Loose Women regular …

Wait. What was that? You know, that ITV daytime show; they talk about the royals, cellulite, that kind of thing.

No, before that: roadkill enthusiast?! Indeed.

You mean she enjoys hitting animals with her car? No, but if someone else happens to, she gets pretty excited.

Why? Because it means supper is sorted.

I am not sure I would have much of an appetite after seeing a dead animal. Street-Porter is made of stronger stuff, as she has explained to her fellow Loose Women.

She did not. She said: “If you see a deer by the side of the road that’s been hit by a lorry or another car, what are you gonna do?”

I’m going to not eat it. “Venison is a free-range meat that lives on grain and I think you’ll find it’s very healthy,” she added.

What did the other Loose Women think? They were shocked, but they shouldn’t have been. Street-Porter had previously revealed her diet in a newspaper column in June. “I’m a convert to roadkill cuisine,” she wrote, “and I can’t wait to try the deer I found on the A1.”

How do you even cook a dead deer? Don’t you have to get its outside off first? According to Street-Porter, her partner found a tutorial on YouTube.

Can you name any other roadkill-eating celebrities? It’s not as common as you might think.

I didn’t imagine it was very common at all. In that case it’s exactly as common as you think: wildlife presenter Chris Packham collects roadkill, but only to feed to foxes; Phillip Schofield once ate a road-killed fox on This Morning, but there’s no suggestion he’s stuck with the practice.

Not quite a trend, then. Not yet, but roadkill is considered by many to be a guilt-free addition to an otherwise vegan diet.

What else is good, besides deer and foxes? Pheasant, squirrel, hedgehog, weasel, badger - it’s all fair game, as long as it was dead when you got there.

Do say: “Here’s a little delicacy from my favourite stretch of the M6.”

Don’t say: “Could you do me a favour and run over this hedgehog for me?”"

The layering secret: how to get a whole new wardrobe from your old clothes

I feel about layering the same way I feel about flossing – I know I should do it, but I never seem to manage it. Layering seems a bit of a palaver, an elaborate affair for dowagers trussed up in yards of crinoline and lace. Without a maidservant to dress me, I wear a uniform of tracksuit bottoms, T-shirts and hoodies.

And besides, I hate to feel constricted. Three-quarter-length sleeves and elasticated waistbands are the equivalent of a window flung open in summer: so freeing! Clothes should accommodate, not constrain.

But. I’ve seen them lately. Women in gossamer-thin turtlenecks layered under crisp cotton shirts, worn with oversized cardigans with the sleeves rolled up just so. They look purposeful … and warm. The sight of a cuff peeking out of a jumper under a blazer is visual poetry.

The Olympians of layering are, of course, the Olsen twins: layering icons who have built the respected fashion label the Row out of knowing exactly how many layers the human body can take before it goes from chic to derelicte (in their case, approximately 14. For regular mortals, no more than five.)

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Layered looks on the catwalk from (l-r) Fendi, Victoria Beckham and Joseph. Composite: Getty,

Layering is also a way to reinvigorate your wardrobe, without extra expense. At London fashion week, Extinction Rebellion protested against the fashion industry’s ruinous environmental impact – estimates for the average lifespan of a garment in the UK range between two and three years. New layering combinations could help them live longer. On Instagram, the #iworeitagain challenge urges fashion-conscious consumers to experiment with the clothes they already own. Well-chosen layers give tired outfits a new lease of life – you can shop your own wardrobe, and get ready for the new season. A long-sleeved T-shirt under a slipdress lets you wear your summer wardrobe well into the winter months – and you can channel your inner Courtney Love.

It is also on trend. At Victoria Beckham’s spring/summer 2020 show, models strode across the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in rollnecks layered under safari shirts, cuffs hanging low to cover the wrists. At Joseph’s SS20 Resort collection: a cobalt-blue double-breasted jacket, worn over a matching kilt – and trousers. At Fendi’s AW19 ready-to-wear show, thin bodysuits were layered underneath shirts, jumpers and dresses, styled with monogrammed tights that looked like leggings.

Layering is an intentional way of dressing; it takes confidence and skill. This is why I have invited the Guardian’s styling editor Melanie Wilkinson over to my home, to help me restyle my wardrobe.

“People are scared of layering,” Wilkinson observes, flipping through my closet. “They think it’s going to look really bulky, but in fact it’s a great way to get the most out of your wardrobe.”

Wilkinson teaches me the two cardinal rules of layering: one, never layer your bottom half, and two, start with finer, thinner materials and work your way out.

“The main thing you need to think about when you are layering is the thickness of the fabrics,” she says. “You need lots of light things to go under chunky things.” Stick to these rules, and you won’t end up resembling Joey from Friends.

Using my own clothes, Wilkinson came up with five brand-new looks to help me layer my way into the winter months.

Look one

Wilkinson pulls a Warehouse mididress out of my wardrobe and styles it with a white Topshop long-sleeve rollneck T-shirt. I’m not sure about the fluted three-quarter-length sleeves over a long-sleeve T-shirt, but Wilkinson reassures me they look great. Paired with my trusty Dr Martens, it’s perfect for transitional September dressing. And an outfit I have worn since.

Look two

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Entry-level layering. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer

I keep on the Topshop T-shirt, which I wear under my favourite striped LF Markey jumper, the sleeves rolled up slightly. Paired with my blue Katharine Hamnett jeans and brown, low-heeled Nanushka boots, this is entry-level layering: a BTech rather than the full Olsen doctoral programme. I like how the rollneck peeks out from under the jumper, though; it makes an everyday outfit of jumper and jeans look more modern.

Look three

A Cos white shirt, under my camel-coloured & Other Stories jumper, with a Monki blazer on top. I keep on the jeans and boots. Wilkinson frowns, and then arranges my jumper so that it is in a French tuck. (It’s good to accentuate your waistline when wearing multiple layers, so that you don’t look swamped in fabric.) I feel smart – I wouldn’t normally wear a shirt under this jumper, which I prefer to pair with jeans and trainers – but it works. I would wear this to a job interview.

Look four

I slip a black, long-sleeved & Other Stories jumper under the Cos shirt, and wear my Paloma Wool button-down overcoat on top. On my bottom half, Tommy Hilfiger chinos and my much-loved Vans. It feels odd to be wearing a jumper underneath a shirt, but Wilkinson explains that this is a fresher, modern take on layering.

I feel as if I could do anything in this outfit: build furniture, change a tyre, even heckle a prime minister if the opportunity arose.

A grey cardigan, my Katharine Hamnett bomber jacket, and Vans. Wilkinson steps back, proud of her handiwork. “Most people wouldn’t style a bomber with a cardigan, but I think the contrast works,” she says. She’s right – the utility-meets-nerd style shouldn’t look good, but it does."

thyme, marjoram and summer savory (if savory and marjoram prove elusive, simply up the thyme) 3 sprigs of each, tied in a posy with twine or bacon rind

bay leaves 5

sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

flat-leaf parsley 2 tbsp, chopped

lemon finely grated zest of ½

rough or puff pastry 500g

egg 1

milk a spoonful

Heat a wide, heavy bottomed pot, add in the butter and melt. Add in the chopped vegetables and bacon. Stir this well and place a lid on top, lifting to stir from time to time, and let the vegetables cook, steaming until soft and bright.

Meanwhile, heat a wide frying pan, add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the chicken legs until gently golden, then add them to the vegetables.

Pour in the wine and stock, add the herb posy and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, and place the lid atop and let cook for 45 minutes over the gentlest heat. When the meat is just cooked, turn off the heat and leave to cool, then lift the chicken out and carefully pick the meat from the bones and add back into the pot.

Stir the pot of vegetables and chicken and taste for seasoning. Remove the bundle of herbs and the bay leaves. Add the chopped parsley and the finely grated zest of lemon. Mix all this together very well but not so much as to break the meat into smaller pieces.

Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4 and fill a handsome pie dish with the chicken and vegetables. Roll out the pastry to cover the dish, about 3-5mm thick. Top the dish with the pastry sheet. Crack the egg into a cup and beat with a fork and then add the milk, then brush liberally over the pastry. Use any offcuts to make a decoration, if you’re feeling creative.

Bake the pie for 45 minutes until the top is golden brown and piping hot. A mighty bowl of parsley and mustard mash alongside, and a bowl of peas, are a fine accompaniment.

Rory O’Connell’s casserole-roast pheasant with red wine and bacon

Pheasant is generally speaking, excellent value for money. The lean birds can be a little dry so I like to casserole-roast them, finding the result juicier, and with the addition of a few robust flavours, the bird is almost self-saucing.

When buying a pheasant, choose the plumpest-looking bird. The addition of cinnamon may seem a little odd, but it adds a delicious scent to the cooking juices. The savoy cabbage puree can be made ahead of time and gently reheated later.

Serves 2; savoy cabbage puree serves 4-6

rind-less fat streaky bacon 100g

olive oil 1 tbsp

plump pheasant 1

red wine 150ml, eg cabernet sauvignon

tinned or bottled tomatoes 100g, finely chopped

cinnamon stick ½

rosemary 1 sprig, about 6cm long

sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

butter 25g (optional)

For the savoy cabbage puree

savoy cabbage 1 head

water 1.75 litres

sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

regular or double cream 25-40ml

salted butter 25-40g

Preheat the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Cut the bacon into fine lardons, about 3cm long and 5mm thick. Heat a heavy casserole on a gentle heat until quite hot. Add the olive oil and then the bacon, stirring it regularly with a wooden spoon and allowing it to become slightly crisp and golden. Remove from the casserole and leave to drain on kitchen paper.

Dry the breast of the pheasant and place it, breast side down, in the fat remaining in the casserole. Cook gently until the breast is golden. Do not try to rush this stage of the recipe, otherwise you may burn the casserole, in which case the flavour of the sauce at the end will be spoiled. Remove the pheasant from the pan and pour off the excess fat. Replace the casserole on a low heat and add the wine, tomatoes, cinnamon, rosemary and bacon. Place the pheasant on top and season with salt and pepper. Place a piece of greaseproof paper and a tight-fitting lid on the casserole and cook in the oven for 1 hour.

For the savoy cabbage puree, remove any damaged outside leaves from the cabbage. However, don’t remove any more of those nice green outside leaves than is necessary, as they are full of flavour and will give lovely bright green flecks to the finished puree. Place the cabbage on a chopping board and cut directly down through the middle of the head, then quarter and remove the hard core. Slice the cabbage against the grain, nice and thinly.

Bring the water to the boil and salt well. Add the cabbage and cook uncovered at a simmer until it is just tender. Strain the cabbage well, reserving 100ml of the cooking water. In a blender or using a handheld blender, blend to a coarse puree, adding cream and butter as you see fit. The consistency should be like that of a soft mashed potato. If the puree is a bit firm, add a little of the reserved cooking water to soften it and blend briefly again. Taste and correct the seasoning and serve in a hot dish. A non-stick pan is perfect for reheating it, and a little of the reserved cooking water can be used if the puree has thickened in the meantime.

When the bird is cooked, remove the casserole from the oven and reduce the temperature to 100C/gas mark ¼. Put the pheasant on a dish, cover it with greaseproof paper, and put it back into the oven to keep warm. Place the casserole on a gentle heat and bring the juices to a simmer. Taste and decide if the liquid needs to reduce a little to concentrate the flavour. If it already tastes delicious, you are ready to go. I sometimes swirl a little butter into the juices at this stage, just to give the sauce a little more body – however, the sauce should not become too thick and strong.

Carve the pheasant neatly and serve with the bubbling sauce and the savoy cabbage puree.

Dan Lepard’s cinnamon cake with blackberries



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dan Lepard’s cinnamon cake with blackberries. Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer

This is one of the lightest cakes you’ll make with wholemeal flour, but it depends on both beating the eggs to a thick froth and adding a little baking powder. The cake freezes well unfilled so you could bake in advance and wait till the berries look just right.

Serves 6-8

eggs 4 medium, at room temperature

caster sugar 200g

golden syrup 50g

wholemeal flour 150g

baking powder ½ teaspoon

ground cinnamon 2 tsp

cold milk 100ml

double cream a small tub

blackberries 1 punnet, or blackberry jam

icing sugar for dusting

Line the base and sides of a deep 20cm round cake tin with non-stick baking paper, and heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Beat the eggs with the sugar and syrup using the whisk attachment on an electric mixer, until pale and thick and the mixture falls like thick ribbons when the beaters are lifted from the bowl. Sift the wholemeal flour, baking powder and cinnamon once, adding back any bran that the sieve collects. Add the milk to the beaten eggs and whisk, then add the flour and whisk once more until just smooth. Pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake in the centre of the oven for 35 minutes, covering the top of the cake with foil for the last 10 minutes if you need to stop it from burning. When a skewer inserted comes out with just a few tiny moist crumbs stuck to it, remove from the oven and leave to cool. Whip the cream lightly, halve the blackberries, then slice the cake into 2 layers and fill with cream and fruit, reassemble the cake and dust lightly with icing sugar or top with extra whipped cream and blackberries.

This is what coronation chicken would taste like if you replaced the chicken with cauliflower and hard-boiled egg. An introduction which possibly makes no sense until you eat it for yourself. If you are missing the chicken side of the equation, then you could do worse than serve this with said bird, roasted on the weekend.

Serves 4-6

cauliflower 1 medium (500g), trimmed and broken into 3-4cm florets; keeping the tender leaves

onion 1 (180g), cut into 1cm thick wedges

olive oil 2 tbsp

mild curry powder 1 tbsp

salt and black pepper

large eggs 9

Greek-style yogurt 100g

mayonnaise 50g

Aleppo chilli flakes 1 tsp (or ½ tsp regular chilli flakes)

cumin seeds 1 tsp, toasted and roughly crushed

lemons 2 – 1 squeezed to get 1 tbsp juice and the second cut into 4-6 wedges, to serve

tarragon 10g, roughly chopped

Turn the oven to its highest setting. Mix the cauliflower florets (with any young leaves attached) in a large bowl with the onion, oil, 2 teaspoons of curry powder, ¾ teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Once combined, spread out on a large parchment-lined baking tray and roast for 15 minutes, until soft and golden-brown but still retaining a bite. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

Fill a medium pan with plenty of water and bring to the boil on a high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high, then carefully lower in the eggs and boil gently for 10 minutes, until hard-boiled.

Drain the eggs, then return them to the same pan filled with running cold water to stop them cooking.

Once cool, peel the eggs, place them in a large bowl and break them roughly with the back of a fork to form large chunks.

In a separate small bowl, mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, the remaining 1 teaspoon of curry powder, half the Aleppo chilli flakes, the cumin, the lemon juice and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Add the sauce to the eggs, along with the cauliflower and onion and the tarragon. Mix together well, spoon the mixture on to a large plate, then sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes and serve, along with the lemon wedges.

Nigel Slater’s baked onions with parmesan and cream



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Slater’s baked onions with parmesan and cream. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin

I normally eat these deeply savoury baked onions as a side-dish to cold roast beef, and that is probably when they are at their best. But today I have them with a plainly roasted chicken (butter, salt and pepper and a few herbs tucked inside, roasted at 180C/gas mark 4 for 60 minutes till juicy and golden) and it is quite one of the most splendid meals I can remember. Frugal, too, as there is cold chicken left for tomorrow.

Serves 4

onions 4 medium to large ones

whipping or double cream 300ml

grated parmesan a good handful

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Peel the onions and bring them to the boil in a deep pot of water. Leave them at a bright simmer for about 25 minutes, until tender. Lift them out with a draining spoon. Slice the onions in half from root to tip and put them cut-side down in an ovenproof dish. Tip the cream over the onions. Season with salt, pepper and the grated cheese and bake for 25-30 minutes, till golden and bubbling.

Thomas Cook has ceased trading after talks failed to save the travel company, placing 9,000 British jobs at risk and triggering a huge repatriation effort to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers overseas.

The Guardian understands that airlines including British Airways and easyJet will be involved in the repatriation – codenamed Operation Matterhorn, for holidaymakers using Thomas Cook, whose destinations range from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean.

The foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday that the government would ensure no one would be left stranded overseas.

Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.

Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:

Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.

Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:

Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.

My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:

There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.

JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:

The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.

Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:

… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.

We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:

A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.

Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:

It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various individuals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.

Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:

It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?

Now I want to know too.

As Democratic lawmakers plan to impeach Donald Trump for abuse of power, the novice Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, must run a gauntlet of US partisan pressure that he has sought desperately to avoid.

Zelenskiy is squeezed between a US president urging him to dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden and a Democratic party that sees the White House’s pressure on him as a compelling argument to unseat Trump.

Ukraine, which counts on US political support and military aid to help repel its larger neighbour Russia, could end up being treated like a political football in the upcoming impeachment battle and the 2020 elections, even as it grapples with larger issues of security and reforms.

Why is the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal so serious? Read more

“I am afraid that Ukraine could become as toxic as Russia was during the Mueller investigation,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the Kyiv-based New Europe Center. “We understand that every move that Trump does in Ukraine will be seen through this scandal. Every ‘no’ to Ukraine will be seen as an act of revenge. Every ‘yes’ is a sign that he wants to prove people wrong.”

Trump had ordered White House staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine shortly before a 25 July telephone call with Zelenskiy, according to the Washington Post, in an apparent bid to put pressure on the new Ukrainian leader. Much of that aid would be directed toward military equipment and training.

“I think [Vladimir] Putin is now applauding what is happening,” Getmanchuk added.

After giving a speech at the United Nations general assembly on Wednesday morning, Zelenskiy made an awkward appearance with Trump before reporters.

The Ukrainian president said that he didn’t want to get involved in American elections, but added: “Nobody pushed me.” Trump chimed in: “In other words, no pressure.”

The White House on Wednesday released a memorandum of the telephone call between Trump and Zelenskiy. During the call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to “look into” the closed investigation of Biden’s son, telling him repeatedly he would put him in touch with Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer with ties to Trump and a former mayor of New York City.

Zelenskiy appeared eager to please Trump in the call, calling him a “great teacher” and echoing his criticisms of European leaders and the former US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Zelenskiy called a “bad ambassador”. Zelenskiy also assured Trump that the next Ukrainian prosecutor would be “100% my person” and would “look into the situation” surrounding Biden and the company Burisma. It is not clear whether Zelenskiy did speak with Giuliani.

He also pointedly told Trump that he had stayed at Trump Tower in New York City. Foreign delegations are thought to stay at Trump properties to curry favour with him.

On Tuesday evening, Zelenskiy had sought to clear the air with a statement saying he wanted Kyiv’s relations with Washington to be “awesome” and that he planned to invite the US president to visit Ukraine. If Trump accepts, it would be the first visit by an American president since George W Bush in 2008.

“The most important thing is that [people] speak about Ukraine, that nobody forgets about Ukraine,” he said in the public remarks.

Pavlo Klimkin, the previous Ukrainian foreign minister, wrote with an acid sense of pride: “Ukraine will remain in the history of the United States as the country that led to the impeachment of the US president. Not a very fun prospect. But now everyone understands what we are capable of.”

Q&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" – although the constitution does not specify what “high crimes and misdemeanors” are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam

Ukrainian diplomats and Zelenskiy himself have sought to downplay the scandal. In remarks to Russian journalists in New York on Wednesday morning, Zelenskiy denied that Trump pressured him in the 25 July call. “Nobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent country,” he said. The only person who could pressure him, he added, “is my son, who is six”.

That contradicted an account by Chris Murphy, a member of the US Senate foreign relations committee, who described both Zelenskiy and his administration in recent meetings as “confused” about “the nature of these demands they were getting from the Trump administration … and that they worry that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens”.

A European diplomat in Kyiv called Zelenskiy’s predicament a “worst-case scenario” where “there is almost no middle ground” between Trump and the Democratic party.

Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst, said that Zelenskiy’s administration had chosen a strategy of “strict neutrality” in order to avoid angering Trump or a possible Democratic administration, should Biden or another candidate win in 2020.

“The Democrats or Trump could be offended, in particular Trump, by the lack of support, but it’s a necessary position for Ukraine,” he said.

Ironically, Fesenko said, the announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry could take some pressure off Zelenskiy this week, as Trump’s actions were closely scrutinised by the press.

“Trump would have to be crazy to come out and put pressure on Zelenskiy now [about Biden],” he said."
232,,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/25/scientists-invent-new-technology-to-print-invisible-messages,2019-09-25T16:00:37,Scientists invent new technology to print invisible messages,"Messages can only be seen under UV light and can be erased using a hairdryer

Forget lemon juice and hot irons, there is a new way to write and read invisible messages – and it can be used again and again.

The approach, developed by researchers in China, involves using water to print messages on paper coated with manganese-containing chemicals. The message, invisible to the naked eye, can be read by shining UV light on the paper.

With the use of hot air from a hairdryer, the message can be erased and the paper reused.

Despite digital communications and data security becoming more sophisticated, the study’s authors said finding ways to securely send hard copy messages remained important.

“Data leakage has become a global problem with terrible consequences including outbreaks of war and severe economic and social issues,” they say in the study.

“Although electronic media have become indispensable in our daily lives, paper is still the most widespread medium for information storage, and many important documents are still paper based.”

Writing in the journal Matter, the team say other approaches to “secure printing” include the use of fluorescent inks that can only be seen under UV light. However, they say these have drawbacks, including that they cannot be erased and the paper reused, and are predictable – meaning the messages, once found, can be easily cracked.

The team report that they have developed a number of solutions to tackle each of these problems. The new approach involves coating filter paper with a polymer that has manganese-containing chemicals, which can absorb UV light and emit green light, and then printing messages on this paper with pure water using an inkjet printer. The team said the materials have very low toxicity.

When the pure water interacts with the manganese-containing chemicals, it disrupts their structure, hence their photoluminescent properties. The upshot is that while the message cannot be seen with the naked eye, it shows up as a dark drawing under short wavelength UV light.

If the paper is heated under a hairdryer for about 30 seconds, the message disappears. So far, the researchers have managed to reuse the paper up to 30 times before it breaks down – with each print costing fractions of a penny.

“If we can find a good substrate to replace filter paper, we believe the cycle numbers will be further improved,” said Dr Yun Ma, the co-author of the study, from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

The authors said the message did not simply disappear with evaporation of water in the absence of a hairdryer, and it can last for more than three months under ambient conditions.

One possible explanation, they say, is that it might be necessary to melt the polymer coating to allow the necessary movement for the structure (and hence photoluminescence) of the manganese-containing chemicals to be restored after the water has evaporated.

The team also took a different approach, using two manganese-containing inks to print a message and background on a different type of coated filter paper.

The message cannot be seen by the naked eye or, importantly, under UV light since the similarity in the inks mean both it and the background emit light of a very similar wavelength and intensity under UV illumination. However, the message emits light over a longer period of time than the background, meaning it can be read using time-based imaging techniques.

Developing this further, the team came up with an even more sophisticated approach that involves printing a series of numbers on paper using several manganese-containing inks, each of which emits light over a different period of time after UV illumination.

By tracking the intensity of light emission over time, a new order of the numbers is revealed – allowing the code to be cracked. The paper can then be washed in a special solution and the same string of numbers reprinted with a different order of the inks to encode a different message.

“This information decryption method possess an extremely high security level and might be promising in military and economic domains,” the team said."

Why Labour's social care policy has had a lukewarm response | David Brindle,"The Labour party’s commitment to free personal care in England has been long in the making and hard-won by its advocates, notably the shadow social care and mental health minister, Barbara Keeley. So why has it not received a warmer and less qualified welcome?

Most experts acknowledge that the new policy is, in the words of the King’s Fund health and care thinktank, “a good step”. But they are far from convinced it would solve the crisis in social care at a stroke and they want to see more detail before accepting it would be the best use of the estimated £6bn a year cost.

The Health Foundation, another thinktank, commented: “Reform to the social care system is badly needed. But the immediate priority for any government should be stabilising the existing system, including by meeting growing demand for care and boosting staff pay.”

Labour to announce it would reverse austerity cuts to adult social care Read more

The first and most obvious reservation about Labour’s policy is that it would apply only to older people aged 65 and over, offering nothing to younger adults whose care accounts for half of councils’ social care spending. The Nuffield Trust, a third thinktank, describes this as a “missed opportunity”.

A second area of caution surrounds Labour’s claims that free personal care would “more than double the number of people receiving state-funded care and reduce the number facing catastrophic costs”. The King’s Fund reckons numbers of older people receiving fully-funded care would rise by just over 50%, while the jury will remain out on catastrophic costs until Labour clarifies how and where it would set a lifetime cap on personal liability.

Economist Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, thinks Labour’s new offer is “rather less generous than it appears”. He has pointed out that the cap would apply only to care costs and would not cover accommodation or charges for activities in care homes.

Free personal care looks a clear and sellable proposition on the doorstep in an election campaign

The definition of “personal” care is a third source of uncertainty. It is not the same thing as social care and does not embrace cleaning, shopping or wider support to help people live independently. Would free personal care help people stay in their own homes? Simon Bottery, senior fellow in social care at the King’s Fund, says there is no clear evidence one way or another but it is “at least plausible”.

Free personal care was introduced in Scotland in 2002, but hard evidence of its benefits is scant. Bottery thinks it “difficult to say” that it has eased pressure on the NHS, for example, and the furthest he will go on its impact on family carers is that it “seems likely” to have helped them, although available evidence is mixed.

Labour may be unperturbed by all of this. By comparison with the complexity of other mooted social care reforms, free personal care looks a clear and sellable proposition on the doorstep in an election campaign. As the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, put it when he unveiled the policy, it would “ensure people with dementia receive the same care as those with other conditions”.

However, the party will need allies in the social care sector. They will be looking for further detail on exactly how free personal care would sit with other policies, such as improving the pay and status of social care workers and – a big concern among disability activists – a continued right to employ personal assistants (PAs) through personal budgets. An estimated 145,000 such PA roles currently exist in England.

Above all, Labour will need to address concerns that bubbled up at the party’s annual conference in Brighton that it plans to take care provision back into local councils wholesale. Provision has passed almost entirely to for-profit and charity operators over the past three decades, so that only an estimated 3% of care home beds are managed directly by councils. The party’s new policy document talks of “rebuilding local authority capacity to deliver care” and enabling councils “to take over existing homes where they are failing or where it would benefit efficient and effective operation of the services”.

Despite this careful wording, several prominent Labour figures have been talking more ambitiously about “nationalisation” of the care sector. This threatens to frighten the horses. As the King’s Fund says: “A properly funded new system should have space for public, private and voluntary care sector care providers – a diversity that has been a feature of social care for 30 years.”

After a day in which the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, Late Show host Stephen Colbert had two words for the audience: “Buckle up.”

For two and a half years, the president has rocked the US government with numerous self-induced scandals, among them: “Russian collusion, obstruction of justice, saying Nazis are fine people, being an unnamed co-conspirator to campaign finance violations, lying about the Moscow Trump Tower, stealing money to pay for the border wall, faking the weather with a Sharpie,” Colbert recapped.

With each of these scandals, “every time, people have asked: is this the thing? Surely, this must be the thing. And it wasn’t the thing,” Colbert said. “But here’s the thing: there’s a new thing, and it might be the thing.”

That thing – the one pre-empting the formal impeachment inquiry – is a snowballing scandal involving phone calls Trump made to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Last week, it was reported that worrying “promises” Trump made in one phone call prompted an intelligence official to file a whistleblower complaint. Since then, numerous outlets have revealed that Trump allegedly pressured the Zelenskiy to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden – the frontrunner to take on Trump in the 2020 election – and used American military aid to the country as leverage.

“No wonder Pelosi is launching an impeachment investigation – this makes Watergate look like Nixon tried to pass an expired coupon at the Kroger,” Colbert said.

A fun fact about this scandal, “if the end of democracy sounds like fun to you”, said Colbert, is that the phone call in question occurred on 25 July – one day after the special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

“So the idea that a foreign power like Russia shouldn’t interfere in our elections is the only thing everyone agreed on,” Colbert explained. “Everyone but Trump, because he just moved one country over.”

“Hello, Ukraine?” Colbert said, mimicking Trump’s voice. “You up? For interfering in our elections?”

Trevor Noah

“If you thought Trump was unhinged before, I can’t even imagine what he’s going to be like now,” said The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah on the impeachment inquiry. “You better keep your kids away from Twitter people, because this thing is gonna be a category 5 tweetstorm – and this one will hit Alabama.”

The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Trump may have invited a foreign government to meddle in a U.S. election. No, not that one, the next one. pic.twitter.com/mrEpF0Mz5F

Noah recapped the bizarre story of the Ukrainian phone call, the whistleblower and perhaps most damningly, the $250m of military aid to Ukraine that Trump inexplicably delayed.

If true, the withheld aid “would be devastating”, said Noah. “It’s an abuse of power, it’s extortion and, maybe worst of all, it’s asking a foreign country to meddle in America’s election. Which is the one thing that if you’re Donald Trump, you should stay away from.”

The Trump administration, Noah remembered, had just gotten over the Mueller investigation into Russia election interference. Immediately seeking help from Ukraine “would be like if the day after Michael Jackson got acquitted for touching kids, he was like: ‘Let’s celebrate! Slumber party at my house!’”

Trump, of course, has either denied or deflected the accusations with a line of defense Noah characterized as “he ain’t done shit”, along with unsubstantiated allegations against Biden and corrupt ties to Ukraine.

There’s no evidence to support Trump’s accusation against Biden, Noah said, “but even if it did, Trump abused the power of his office to try to dig up dirt on a political opponent”.

Jimmy Kimmel

Tuesday was “a major news day in the history of the United States”, said Jimmy Kimmel from Los Angeles on Tuesday night. Pelosi’s announcement on the impeachment inquiry was especially notable because she had been resisting the calls to impeach for so long, but “once again, Donald Trump is doing what he does best: forcing a woman to do something she didn’t want to do”, said Kimmel.

“I guess he feels like nothing can stop him now,” Kimmel said after recapping the week of revelations that rolled into impending impeachment. “He got away with Russia and the election, and it makes perfect sense he would ask Ukraine to help him with the next one.”

It’s a lot of drama, Kimmel said, all because Trump is “dumb … he gets on the phone and he can’t resist saying stupid stuff”.

Kimmel then reminisced on when Trump once tweeted, in 2014: “Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?”

“Well, we’re about to find out,” Kimmel replied."

Last year Eva Bodenmüller read about a city in eastern Germany inviting people to live there for a month for free. She and her partner Carsten Borck, an artist, knew they had to leave their residence in Italy soon and weren’t looking forward to moving back to their native Berlin.

“I thought: ‘Why not Görlitz?’” said Bodenmüller, a freelance journalist .

Görlitz, Germany’s easternmost city, is a well-preserved gem that has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in Hollywood films from The Grand Budapest Hotel to Inglourious Basterds to The Reader. But its pastel-coloured old town, which draws 140,000 tourists a year, hides a darker reality.

We have the feeling it doesn’t matter whether we stay here. We’re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment Carsten Borck

The city has Germany’s lowest wages and one of the country’s highest shares of far-right voters. After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, easterners fled west in droves, driving Görlitz’s population down more than 25% to 54,000 in 2013.

City officials decided they needed to do something to reverse this trend, and hit upon the idea of offering a free one-month stay, no strings attached.

Other cities had already been experimenting with the idea of luring new residents by offering to cover their housing. Detroit was the first big city to try it, launching an innovative programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year, and today the idea is being used everywhere from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, which offers $10,000 to digital workers to move there for a year.

The proportion of workers who conduct their business remotely is growing. Already, millions of people spend much of their adult lives hopscotching from one place to another, perhaps including the occasional work-tourism visit to Medellín or Tokyo. The officials behind Görlitz’s programme figured it could both attract some of those nomadic workers and give them the chance to learn some lessons on how to reverse its population decline.

“When we applied we thought the project was about convincing people to move to Görlitz,” Borck said over borscht at a restaurant overlooking the Neisse River. “But now we have the feeling it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after these four weeks or not. We’re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment.”

The Görlitz-based Interdisciplinary Centre for Ecological and Revitalising Urban Transformation (IZS), which is overseeing Testing the City, as the federally funded project is known, received more than 150 applications. Two-thirds were from larger cities, and several came from outside Germany, including from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the US and the UK.

The 54 individuals and groups participating are singles, couples and families ranging from their 20s to 60s, including digital entrepreneurs, a film-maker, a model, visual artists and musicians. Each is assigned to one of three project-maintained apartments and offered free use of one of three spaces for work.

It’s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks Eva Bodenmüller

Though the municipality hopes that some will permanently relocate to Görlitz, the main intention is for ISZ to use participant interviews and questionnaires to inform a national urban development policy to help revive Germany’s smaller cities. “Our aim is to learn more about what people need, and if they move, what is their motivation,” said IZS head Robert Knippschild.

Görlitz is a fascinating place to test these theories. The city has around 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is a third higher than the national average. This, in part, is why Görlitz has taken in 1,200 refugees. But surveys have shown immigration to be the most urgent issue for residents of eastern Germany, where the far right has taken hold.

Görlitz has not seen the sort of xenophobic violence that has struck Chemnitz and Dresden, but has been called “the living room” of the nativist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. This year the AfD came out on top in Görlitz in the European parliament elections and the state election on 1 September, polling at more than 37%, and also won the first round of the mayoral election, though the Christian Democratic Union candidate, Octavian Ursu, won the runoff in June.

“It was a tough campaign,” said Ursu, a Romanian immigrant who played lead trumpet in the local philharmonic orchestra before turning to politics. He says he wants to put the animosity of the election in the past, and sees Testing the City as part of a budding revival which includes a new data analysis centre employing 120 scientists and engineers, a Siemens hydrogen technologies innovation campus that will employ another 100, and a €36m (£32m) facelift for the art nouveau municipal hall.

Ursu believes the key to creating jobs is a more welcoming society. “I’ve said to the people, you must think about whether you want to have an open city, a European city, or a closed city,” he said.

This is not a settled question in Görlitz. A July report on the project by the German news outlet Deutsche Welle attracted sharp comments online. “The incentive to lure you here is just the desperate attempt of our city to fight the shrinking population,” said YouTube user Polter Geist. “They hope your leftwing alternative garbage will appeal to the youth.”

This project is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Görlitz Robert Knippschild

During their stay, Bodenmüller and Borck have sought to engage with these issues directly. Borck staged a show of his work at the Europa Haus gallery, with posters asking passersby questions such as “Am I welcome here?” and “How do I know you are not a Nazi?”.

The couple said they spent a lot of time talking to locals and found a city of extremes. “In other places you generally have people from different groups talking to each other,” said Bodenmüller, who has lived in Berlin, Munich and several smaller towns. “But here there is no centre – there are just the two sides.”

Another project participant, Nikolas Kammerer, 34, a photographer from Leipzig, sees the locals as one of the city’s main draws. He found it refreshing that artists and creative workers in Görlitz are not looking to become YouTube stars or Instagram influencers, but instead are laser-focused on producing and collaborating. He credits his month in the city for his first successful commission for the German news outlet Die Zeit: a portrait series of local voters on election day. “In Leipzig I probably wouldn’t have done this,” he said.

He also saw the other perspective, at a far-right election rally where the AfD candidate denounced foreigners as criminals and the crowd chanted “Lugen Presse!” (“lying press!”). “It was horrible,” said Kammerer, whose grandmother is from Görlitz. “Most of these far-right people don’t want to talk to the media, which is a problem because I want to have them represented in my work.”

With the project about halfway through, four participants have committed to move to Görlitz, including German-Finnish poet Mark Mallon and his wife, Finnish artist Venla Saalo. The couple decided to leave Berlin because of its traffic, pollution and high rents, and settled in Görlitz in April. “Görlitz feels like a lively town with a lot of young people, students, opportunities, empty spaces, and on the other hand peace and remoteness,” they said. “It is a great combination for creative work.”

Borck and Bodenmüller like the cheap rents and high density of organic grocery stores and vegetarian restaurants but wish Görlitz had better regional transport and more open-mindedness. They also wished they had more time there.

“It’s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks,” said Bodenmüller. “If we could stay here longer, we could leave and come back and have a better chance to understand the city.”

Knippschild’s early conclusions from the pilot project suggest that cultural offerings and leisure activities are crucial to attracting nomadic workers, as are reliable travel connections and good housing.

“People are taking the project seriously, thinking about which phase of life they are in and what they need in terms of housing and living,” he said of the participants. “This is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Görlitz.”

There were 53 galleries from around the world showcasing artists, including 19 galleries exhibiting for the first time.

Beside the main exhibition compound, the fair spread to several venues throughout the town.

Promesas de Saliva, from the series Rage of Devotion, by Lisa Ambrosio

More than 60 female photographers were on show, and subjects ranged from globalisation and the climate crisis, via abstract and experimental photography, portraiture and body photography, to political and urban landscapes.

The main difference between Unseen and other major fairs is its dual nature as both a high-end art photo fair and a contemporary photography festival. Artistic director Marina Paulenka said: “We want to bridge worlds and erase boundaries between high-end and make it accessible for everyone to appreciate modern photography.”

Paulenka, a native of Zagreb in Croatia, was on her way to the Venice Biennale in May when the call came through of her appointment by Unseen. She admits to being in tears. One of her first contributions was to bring French artist Tabita Rezaire, whose work is about decolonisation and has observed that today’s internet cables follow the slavery routes of old.

When asked if it was a bit cheeky to showcase an artist who predominantly uses video installation, Paulenka’s answered that photography was constantly evolving and pushing boundaries.

Joana Choumali

Joana Choumali comes from Ivory Coast, and is exhibited by Gallery 1957 from Accra in Ghana. Her mixed-media photographs, overlaid with embroidered details in vivid colours, are truly a joyous spectacle.

Her inspiration for this style came after a long and traumatic illness, during which she taught herself embroidery as a therapeutic exercise. It was the first light of the day whose colour Choumali wanted to capture.

Her work will also be exhibited at the V&A museum in London as a part of Prix Pictet 19, which opens on 14 November.

Liz Nielsen

Liz Nielsen’s abstract landscapes vibrate with colour and layers, each telling a story. The American artist (presented by Black Box Projects) adheres to one of the first experimental photographic techniques: the photogram. She works in complete darkness, save for the occasional use of mobile phone light bounced off the ceiling, to create colours in the most basic ways without lenses.

The Interdimensional Landscapes series was shot on a road trip in Yellowstone national park in Utah that turned out to be tragic and has a very personal meaning.

David Favrod

The Ibasho gallery exhibited artist David Favrod, who is of Swiss-Japanese heritage but is currently based in Spain. His work combines manga and anime-style drawings with photography. He usually starts by sketching. Or, in the case of an artwork titled The Fall (La Chute), by digging a hole for a week.

Clockwise from top left: The Day of the Fires; Les 4 Cols, from the Sound of the Black Waves series; work-in-progress shots of The Fall; Une Pluie de Sardines © David Favrod, courtesy Ibasho

As there was a boulder beneath where he began digging, he used Photoshop to make the hole look deeper. After scanning the photograph, and 2,500 hours of Photoshop drawing later, the image was finished.

His surreal work A Shower of Sardines, meanwhile, resembles Magritte in a manga style.

Mustapha Azeroual

At first sight, the work of French-Moroccan light artist Mustapha Azeroual (Galerie Binome) could be taken as being inspired by cubism. His technique involves capturing several images on the same film, transferring them on to a single image, and therefore distorting them in a multistage process of capturing and deconstructing, before merging them again. These untitled works from his series Radiance feature four different locations superimposed into one.

Jana Sophia Nolle

Jana Sophia Nolle’s socially charged series Living Room (Catharine Clark Gallery) places the shelters of some of San Francisco’s homeless into affluent domestic interiors. The intimacy and vulnerability of the shelters is emphasised by the stable structures of the living rooms, with their paintings and bookshelves. It offers a different take on the concept of privacy, and emphasises the value of security, by comparison to the temporary refuge used by the growing number of homeless people in the second richest city in the US.

David Uzochukwu

Slab, top; Bouyant, left; Uprising, right, both from the series Drown in Magic (2019) by David Uzochukwu, courtesy Galerie Number 8

Twenty-year-old David Uzochukwu (Galerie Number 8), was the youngest artist on show at Unseen this year, and his observations on race and migration are powerful and somewhat disturbing. One photograph, Uprising, involves fish Photoshopped to look like a serpent. He draws inspiration from Greek mythology, but Bleeding Body Near Water is a direct parallel with migrant crossings into Europe. Uzochukwu is of mixed Austrian and Nigerian heritage, and lives in Belgium. His everyday experiences of racial bias permeate his work.

HyperFocal by Simon Roberts

There were many other artists at Unseen deserving of mention, including Simon Roberts, whose magical forest landscapes could have come straight out of Lord of the Rings ; Charles Xelot, who shows Nenet reindeer herders filling the void of Siberian Arctic; Parisa Aminolahi, whose work deals with homeland, exile and childhood memories; and Xing, an online female collective.

What lies beneath: the craze for 'selfeets' of eye-catching floors



From brightly patterned tiles to intricate mosaics, sometimes beauty is right under our feet.

Hundreds of thousands of Instagrammers have shared photos of eye-catching floors using the #ihavethisthingwithfloors hashtag. Featuring striking geometric designs, positive affirmations and colourful bricks, they reveal that attractive floors can appear in some pretty unlikely places – such as this one in Dallas/Fort Worth international airport.

The craze started one night in a bar in Amsterdam when work friends Edith Beurskens, Josha Jansen and Pien van Wijmen discovered they had something in common: they all enjoyed sharing pictures of their feet on attractive floors on Instagram. They decided to create a dedicated account where they could share their own photos and re-gram beautiful floors, using the hashtag #ihavethisthingwithfloors.

Instagrammers are instructed: “When feet meet nice floors, take a selfeet.”

Five years later, more than 845,000 photos have been shared from cities from Hội An to Beirut to Miami. Some are featured on the team’s original account, often coupled with an inspirational or punny caption.

But this frame is different. It captures a youthful Clay in a moment of tranquility – perhaps lost in thought or concentration – his legacy yet to be written. Though Clay was felled by a sweet left hook by Cooper in the fourth round, he would recover to win the bout and went on to achieve unprecedented success in the ring, becoming heavyweight champion of the world three times. Through his refusal to fight in the Vietnam war and his staunch support of civil rights, he ultimately transcended sport itself and become an icon of the 20th century.

She should have stuck to her guns.

In surrendering to the radicals and the noisy drumbeat of their media handmaidens, Pelosi established a formal investigative process involving the top legislative committees.

Yet she did something else, too, something far more monumental: She effectively committed House Dems to impeaching President Trump.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

Because of what she said and did, if the House doesn’t go all the way, it will be a political disaster. Either failing to take a vote on articles of impeachment, or failing to get enough votes among her majority to pass any articles, would be seen as a political exoneration for Trump, likely leading to his re-election.

If all that weren’t risky enough, consider another scenario. If House Dems do impeach Trump on grounds that much of the public sees as flimsy and concocted, they could win the battle and lose the war. Indeed, no matter what the House does, there is a next-to-zero chance the GOP controlled Senate would convict the president absent clear and convincing “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

Pelosi knew all that since January, when she became Speaker, which is why she kept resisting the impeachers. But her surrender proved again that her party can’t quit 2016. Like generals fighting the last war, she and they are now committed to taking their sore-loser grievances to 2020 voters.

Dems apparently assume the country hates Trump as much as they do. President Hillary Clinton had no comment on the strategy.

They also are demonstrating they didn’t learn the lessons of the Robert Mueller probe.

Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, right, tasked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with forming a new government after last week’s deadlocked elections. (Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images)

Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to try forming a new governing coalition, moving the country into the next phase of its post-election haggling.

“The law gives you, Mr. Prime Minister, 28 days, starting tomorrow, to form a government,” Rivlin said as the two stood together at the president’s residence.

Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority.

But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.

“I accept the mission,” said Netanyahu, acknowledging the long struggle he is likely to face in building a majority coalition within Israel’s fractured political system. “I do this knowing that I don’t have a higher chance of forming a government but that I have less of an inability than Gantz.”

Netanyahu’s path to forming a governing coalition is lined with hazards. He has pledged to include ultra-Orthodox Jewish factions, and that probably will deter potential secular partners. He also has endorsed sharing power with Blue and White, but Gantz promised during the campaign never to join forces with Likud unless Netanyahu stepped down.

Adding to the drama and uncertainty, the prime minister faces a legal hearing Wednesday in three corruption cases involving allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The hearing could lead to his indictment.

If Netanyahu ultimately fails to assemble a majority in the Knesset, he will have to return the mandate to the president. By tradition, Gantz would then be given a chance to form a government.

Rivlin called the two candidates to his official residence two times this week in an attempt to broker a power-sharing arrangement between the major parties. But after three days of negotiations failed to produce a deal, he acted.

The president is obliged to select the candidate he thinks has the best chance of assembling a majority coalition. In a tally of recommendations from Knesset members, Netanyahu was preferred by one more member than Gantz, and Rivlin cited this slight edge.

“The probability of the prime minister forming a government is greater at this moment,” Rivlin said.

In moving so fast, Rivlin may have been looking at a difficult calendar. Israel is about to enter a period of religious holidays, with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, beginning Sunday evening, and several others to soon follow.

“He’s clearly trying to get things moving as quickly as possible,” said Jason Pearlman, a onetime media adviser to Rivlin. “[Netanyahu] has got one more recommendation than Gantz does, so it would be logical for him to take the first bite of the cheese.”

Rivlin’s choice of Netanyahu advances Israel’s complex electoral process to the next phase, but it does not move the country much closer to a resolution of the political gridlock that has consumed it for much of the year.

Netanyahu has embraced the idea of sharing power with Gantz’s party. Rotating the prime minister’s job not only would let Netanyahu extend his decade in power, but it may be his best hope of avoiding prosecution over the next months. Observers here speculate the real negotiations will come down to who takes the top job first in a unity government.

“We need this unity, this national reconciliation,” said Netanyahu. “We have been through a tough election campaign, and now we need to unite the people.”

But Gantz doubled down on his pledge not to serve with Netanyahu.

“Blue and White, led by me, does not agree to sit in a government whose leader is facing a severe indictment,” he said in a statement. “This issue, among a number of other critical factors, is more important to us than any delegation of ministerial posts or a rotation.”

Netanyahu will have at least four weeks to build a 61-seat majority, and the possible options are many. Israelis are constantly shifting through the scenarios, which range from Netanyahu and Gantz sharing the prime minister’s job to another collapse of the process, leading to Israel’s third election of the year.

As always in Israeli politics, the dealmaking is dizzying. Immediately following last week’s election, Netanyahu extracted written support from right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties.

Representatives of the two ultra-Orthodox parties — Shas and United Torah Judaism — and Yamina, a religious nationalist faction of three smaller parties, pledged support for Netanyahu in their meetings with the president Sunday and Monday. Their backing brings the number of Knesset members supporting Netanyahu to 55.

Gantz drew support from two left-wing parties, Labor and the Democratic Union, adding 11 members to the 33 from Blue and White. He also received backing for the first time in three decades from a union of Arab parties, and that gave him an additional 10 votes.

But three parliamentarians from the Arab nationalist party Balad ultimately refused to throw their support to Gantz, citing his military record in the West Bank and Gaza. Their votes proved consequential when Netanyahu prevailed by a single recommendation.

Arab parliamentarians are unlikely to be invited to join a coalition.

Hawkish former defense minister Avigdor Liberman also refused to support either candidate. In the past, Liberman, who shares the prime minister’s right-wing positions on security, has put his support behind Netanyahu. But it was Liberman’s refusal to join a government with the ultra-Orthodox parties that sent the country to an unprecedented second election. In that vote, Liberman doubled his Yisrael Beiteinu party’s presence in the Knesset, drawing eight seats. He has said that he wants to see a centrist, secular unity government between Likud and Blue and White, minimizing the influence of sectoral parties.

Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was “wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.”

Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.

“Instead of deciding to let the voters decide, they ran to the courts,” Johnson accused.

[U.K. Supreme Court rules Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally]

Pointing at Corbyn across the dispatch boxes, Johnson asked: “Is he going to dodge a vote of no confidence in me as prime minister in order to escape the verdict of the voters? Does he in his heart even want to be prime minister anymore?”

“What are they scared of?” Johnson wondered aloud, turning then to the smaller opposition parties — the Greens, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party — and asking whether any of them might “fancy a go?”

Corbyn rose to call Johnson “a dangerous prime minister who thinks he’s above the law.”

Corbyn, the 70-year-old socialist who would run as Labour’s standard-bearer, raised his chin toward Johnson, saying: “I want a general election. If he wants an election, get an extension and let’s have an election.”

Corbyn wants to avoid an abrupt and chaotic exit from the European Union on Oct. 31 without a deal to manage the withdrawal — as Johnson has threatened.

There’s also a political calculation. Corbyn wants to keep Johnson locked in a kind of limbo — neither letting him fulfill his promise to bust loose from the E.U., nor letting him dissolve the government and potentially win back a majority in an election.

[In or out? Labour Party remains tortuously conflicted over Brexit and leader Jeremy Corbyn.]

Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a think tank, said Labour’s play is a good short-term strategy. “Boris is twisting in the wind,” Grant said. “He’s in office, but not in power. He can’t pass legislation. He can’t call an election.”

But Grant said that if it goes on for too long “it might damage Labour — people will say, ‘It’s ridiculous. We’re not being governed. We need a proper government, and that requires an election.’ ”

The calendar is challenging. If a no-confidence vote were held this week, lawmakers would have until the second week of October to form a viable alternative government. By then, they would be just days away from when the prime minister — whoever is in the job — is by law supposed to ask the E.U. for an extension.

Corbyn would no doubt prefer Johnson to be the one to have to ask for another delay, breaking his “do or die” pledge. That would spare Corbyn from being accused of “dither and delay” in a coming election.

But opposition parties would also be wary that if a no-confidence vote succeeded now, Britain could face the Brexit deadline at a moment when it’s not clear who is in charge.

The earliest an election could happen would be mid-November.

And so the prime minister and Parliament are likely to continue to clash in the weeks to come.

Wednesday was one of the most raucous sessions in recent memory, with Conservative Party members bursting into applause — this is very much against the rules — and opposition backbenchers shouting at Johnson to resign.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who had advised Johnson that the suspension of Parliament was legal, brushed aside calls for his own ouster, saying, “If I was called upon to resign every time I lost a case, I’d never have a practice.”

Cox then exploded at law­makers for their inaction.

“This is a dead Parliament,” he said. “It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.”

“But the time is coming,” he warned, his booming voice rising above the wild cheering and jeering. “The time is coming, Mr. Speaker, when even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas!”

Labour lawmaker Barry Sheerman later rose and, with beet-red face, stabbing his finger toward Cox, shouted: “No shame today! No shame at all! . . . For a man like him, a party like this, and a leader like this — this prime minister — to talk about morals and morality is a disgrace.”

For his part, Johnson called the gathering “a zombie parliament” with an “obsessive desire to overrule the referendum result.”

“I thought we were coming to hear a statement on the Supreme Court judgment,” said Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker who helped launch the case. “But instead we’ve been treated to the sort of populist rant one expects to hear from the leader of a tin-pot dictatorship or perhaps the current president of the States.”

Johnson repeatedly called the bill that will require him to seek a Brexit delay a “surrender act” and was taken to task for his use of “inflammatory” language.

Paula Sherriff, a Labour lawmaker, said many politicians were “subject to death threats and abuse every single day and let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words ‘surrender act, betrayal, traitor.’ ”

The man who murdered pro-E.U. British lawmaker Jo Cox in 2016 had described her as a “traitor.”

Johnson responded to Sherriff that he had “never heard such humbug in all my life.”

House Speaker John Bercow tried to calm the ensuing scenes, shouting “Order!” no less than 12 times in a row.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)

NEW YORK — President Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro kicked off proceedings at the U.N. General Assembly with nationalist screeds. Bolsonaro raged against the global reaction to widespread fires in the Amazon, casting his country as a victim to manipulative activist organizations and a “lying"" foreign press.

In the heart of the world’s most important international institution, the duo hailed national sovereignty above all else — a constant theme of Trump’s three years in power and a potent narrative, as well, for the former army captain who is now Brazil’s president.

“We are not here to erase nationalities in the name of an abstract global interest,” Bolsonaro said.

“The future does not belong to the globalist,"" Trump said, following up. “It belongs to patriots.”

Other world leaders are amused by such rhetoric. In an interview with Today’s WorldView, center-left Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez lamented the effect of Trump’s leadership on the world stage. That ranges from environmental policy — Sánchez expressed dismay that “we have someone leading the United States who doesn’t believe in climate change” nor appreciates the “urgency” of the moment — to the Trump administration’s confrontation with Iran.

“The international agreement reached with the Iranian regime was very positive for the peace and security of the world,” said Sánchez, referring to the nuclear deal forged between Tehran and world powers that Trump chose to break. “It’s a pity the United States put it into question.”

Sánchez said he rejects Trump’s protectionist rhetoric on trade, particularly the administration’s decision to cast European partners as national security threats as a way to slap tariffs on some of their exports. But he expressed confidence that the transatlantic relationship can be saved, because it is “something that overcomes administrations.” On climate, he pointed to the work being done by several U.S. mayors and governors to curb emissions and build more sustainable economies, with or without federal support.

Trump’s presidency nevertheless has had a definitive effect. Echoing an argument pushed by figures such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Sánchez stressed the need for Europe to chart its own path on the world stage and move away from decades of sheltering under the umbrella of an American superpower.

“The role that Europe must play, not only here, but in the years to come,” said Sánchez, is “to create more balance” in global politics. “There was a need” for this degree of independence before, he admitted, “but it’s also true that the new position of this U.S. administration has intensified the need.”

Whether Sánchez himself will have much of a role to play in that geopolitical shift remains to be seen. After being unable to build a stable ruling coalition, Sánchez threw in the towel and called for new elections in November. Spain’s parliament dissolved this week. It’ll be the country’s fourth election in four years and the second one this year.

Sánchez’s opponents on both the far left and the center-right blame him for not wanting to work with them. But in his conversation with Today’s WorldView, he pinned the failure on his rivals for not recognizing the superior political mandate won by Sánchez and his Socialist Worker’s Party in April.

“If you use the multiparty system to block the formation of a government, this is damaging to democracy,” he said, adding that the elections in November were now “a great opportunity to overcome this blockage.”

This might be a risky bet. Spain’s fragmented political landscape will make it difficult for Sánchez to win an outright majority, even if his Socialists, the country’s traditional center-left mainstay, do claw back a few more votes from parties to its left and right.

Then there is the question of Catalonia, the wealthy northeast region where a secessionist movement triggered a constitutional crisis in 2017 by staging an independence referendum deemed illegal by Madrid. The tensions over Catalonia fanned political flames elsewhere, helping stoke the rise of Vox, a far-right party which claimed about 10 percent of the vote.

And it will probably shadow the November election, too. In October, sentences are expected for a number of Catalan separatist leaders who appeared in a publicly televised trial on charges of sedition and rebellion.

When asked by Today’s WorldView if he would consider possible pardons for the Catalan separatist leaders, Sánchez said he would “respect the work of the judicial power.” He also criticized the “undemocratic behavior” of Catalonia’s separatists, linking their demands for independence with a host of “reactionary movements” that sprang up in Europe in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

En un año, este Gobierno ha demostrado que los problemas de #España se pueden superar desde la óptica progresista. Que se puede crecer y repartir, con justicia social, que se puede gobernar con limpieza y ejemplaridad, apostando por la convivencia. pic.twitter.com/JMB4nWubuT — Pedro Sánchez (@sanchezcastejon) September 17, 2019

While Trump and Bolsonaro decried the perils of “socialism,” which the U.S. president branded “the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies,” Sánchez believes his party’s politics are necessary in an age of climate change and yawning social inequality.

“It’s important to show people a progressive manner to face these challenges,” he said, pointing to his ambitious goals for renewable energy in Spain that, as of now, have not dented his support among the traditional rural working class that earned a living in industries related to fossil fuels.

Last year, his government struck a deal with unions to shut down most of the country’s coal mines but also inject hundreds of millions of euros in investment in those regions. “We went there and spoke to them and told them we weren’t going to leave them behind and alone,” Sánchez said. “It’s very important to show people that we have to face this transition and this transition must be fair.”

It is that sort of reckoning with inequality, he suggests, that can thwart the siren song of nationalists and populists. Unlike Trump, or former Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, Sánchez has taken a welcoming approach to refugees seeking safe passage to Europe.

“Spain accepts diversity as an asset,” Sánchez declared. “We are an inclusive country.”

308,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/09/25/glacier-alps-might-collapse-thanks-global-warming-officials-say/,2019-09-25T17:19:09,"A glacier in the Alps might collapse, thanks to global warming, officials say","Surveys had shown that the lower portion of the glacier was moving 19 to 23 inches per day, prompting the closure of certain roads and the precautionary evacuation of some residences in zones closest to the glacier. In safer areas, residents, workers and public officials and employees would be allowed to access the roads, but only emergency vehicles would be permitted to travel after dark.

It was not clear that the Planpincieux glacier’s collapse was imminent, and officials conceded that they had no warning system for such an event. But officials say the glacier’s precarious status was the result of a climate emergency that had already begun, and over which an international group of scientists sounded yet another alarm this week.

New U.N. climate report: Massive change already here for world’s oceans and frozen regions

“These phenomena testify once again how the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,” the mayor of Courmayeur, Stefano Miserocchi, said in a statement. “In this case it is a temperate glacier particularly sensitive to high temperatures.”

Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte echoed the mayor’s comments.

“It is now news that a glacier on Mont Blanc risks collapsing,” Conte said. “It’s an alarm that cannot leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and mobilize us.”

Discussion of the impending climate catastrophe dominated the first days of the annual U.N. meeting in New York. The week kicked off with teen climate activist Greta Thunberg’s passionate call for world leaders to take significant action on climate change.

On Wednesday, the organization’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released yet another ominous report about the effects already underway.

The mysterious lost continent that helped form the Alps

“Glaciers, snow, ice and permafrost are declining and will continue to do so,” the scientists wrote in a statement accompanying the report. “This is projected to increase hazards for people, for example through landslides, avalanches, rockfalls and floods.”

“Smaller glaciers found for example in Europe, eastern Africa, the tropical Andes and Indonesia are projected to lose more than 80% of their current ice mass by 2100 under high emission scenarios,” the statement continued. That glacial loss would “continue to adversely affect recreational activities, tourism, and cultural assets.”

The glaciers in the Alps provide vital water and meet the hydroelectric needs of the region and play a key role in tourism. But under a limited global warming scenario, these frozen resources could lose two-thirds of their volume by the end of the century, according to a study published in April in the Cryosphere journal. Under a stronger global warming model, the researchers, based in Switzerland, projected that the Alps’s glaciers would disappear almost entirely by 2100.

The melting process is already underway. On Sunday, hundreds of people gathered in Switzerland to mourn the Pitzol glacier. It had lost 80 to 90 percent of its volume since 2006.

Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani’s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government, according to two officials with knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic exchanges.

Experts said the reason such tasks are usually left up to diplomats rather than nongovernment freelancers is to ensure that a foreign government receives a consistent message across the vast U.S. federal bureaucracy.

“Clearly it should be the full-time diplomats who know Ukraine well who should be dealing with all these issues,” said Angela Stent, a former Russia hand in the George W. Bush administration.

In the rough transcript of the call released Wednesday, Trump praises Giuliani as a “highly respected man” who was a “great mayor.”

“If you could speak to him that would be great,” Trump tells Zelensky.

The president asked Zelensky to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and for help in finding the Democratic National Committee computer server that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 election.

The issue of corruption is particularly sensitive in Ukraine as it has dominated discussions between Washington and Kiev in the context of development and democracy assistance, said Stent and other Ukraine watchers.

“The U.S. has been trying to tell Ukrainians for years that they have to deal with their own corrupt system and implement the rule of law, otherwise they won’t get U.S. or IMF funding,” she said, referring to the International Monetary Fund. “And having someone else coming and representing the president and giving them a different message which is ‘we want you to find as much dirt as you can on the vice president’s son’ sends a mixed message.”

For months, Giuliani has been pressing the Ukrainian government behind the scenes, gathering information about Biden and briefing Trump on his findings, Giuliani told The Washington Post.

Earlier this year, Giuliani had planned a trip to Ukraine, but it was aborted amid criticism about the propriety of his visit. Instead, he has had phone calls and meetings with Ukrainian officials in New York and Madrid.

A day before the release of the transcript, Giuliani denied that he was pursuing an alternative Ukraine agenda in a Fox News interview. “You know who I did at the request of? The State Department,” he said while holding up his cellphone, suggesting that he maintained the call logs. “I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it. And then I reported every conversation back to them.”

Giuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak.

A State Department official said Giuliani “does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government” and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak’s request. Yermak’s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call.

U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said.

Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.

Andrew Weiss, a Russia scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Giuliani’s efforts to launch an investigation into Biden’s son came at a particularly sensitive time in U.S.-Ukraine relations given the surprise victory of Zelensky, a political novice and former comedian, over President Petro Poroshenko this spring.

“When the new government was being formed, U.S. officials were trying to ensure continuity with the Zelensky government, but then Giuliani throws this grenade into Ukraine’s lap and forces them to take a side in American politics and Ukrainians were worried about that,” Weiss said. “None of what Giuliani was doing was connected to core priorities of U.S. diplomacy at the time.”

In May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky — who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution — had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.

But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early.

Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a “prosecutor to a former prosecutor.” But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the “black ledger” that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened.

Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: “I’m not going to tell you about that.”

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

“It’s not a new phenomenon to have politically connected people swoop in and trade on their powerful relationships with the president,” said Weiss, who served in the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations. “But there’s never been a sense of so much mischievous and willful spinning on the formal ways the U.S. conducts foreign policy.”

(Family photo)

Shuping Wang, a medical researcher who defied Chinese authorities in the early 1990s by exposing the burgeoning HIV epidemic in one of her country’s poorest provinces, where an estimated 1 million destitute farmers sold their blood plasma at collection sites and were infected with the deadly disease, died Sept. 21. She was 59.

She was hiking in a canyon in Salt Lake City when she suffered an apparent heart attack, said her husband, Gary Christensen.

Dr. Wang had lived for the past 18 years in the United States, becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, but continued to contend with the intimidation by Chinese government officials that had helped drive her from her home.

As recently as last month, she had said, Chinese police called on her friends and colleagues in Zhoukou, the city in Henan province that was the site of much of her whistleblowing work, in an effort to pressure Dr. Wang to halt a play about her story on stage at the Hampstead Theatre in London.

“The only thing harder than standing up to the Communists and their security police is not giving in to pressure from friends and relatives who are threatened with their livelihoods all because you are speaking out,” she said in a statement on Sept. 3. “But even after all this time, I will still not be silenced.”

Among AIDS activists and others who followed her work, Dr. Wang was regarded as a heroine who risked her career and safety to expose the rampant spread of hepatitis C and HIV among poor villagers recruited by the government to sell their blood plasma for medical purposes.

“Extend your arm. Expose a vein. Make a fist. And it’s 50 yuan,” or approximately $7.50, went one slogan. For Henan farmers, that sum represented a considerable windfall.

Chinese officials had embarked on the collection campaign in an effort to keep HIV, which they regarded as a foreigner’s disease, out of the Chinese blood supply. Instead of relying on foreign blood products as HIV/AIDS spread across the United States and other countries, China would harvest its own.

But, as Dr. Wang began to discern in the early 1990s, poor collection practices — as well as government efforts to cover up their consequences — fueled the wild spread of the disease. Among other unsafe methods, blood was drawn from multiple donors and combined. After the plasma was extracted, the remaining mixed blood was reinjected into the donors. If any one donor had HIV, all the others might contract it.

A specialist in hepatitis, Dr. Wang was assigned to a plasma collection station in Zhoukou in 1991. After confirming her suspicions that many donors there were infected with hepatitis C, she implored officials at the site to change the collection prac­tices.

“This will increase cost,” she said she was told.

Undeterred, Dr. Wang took her concerns to the Ministry of Health in Beijing, which began requiring hepatitis C screening for blood plasma donors in 1993, she wrote in an account of her work published on the website China Change in 2012. Officials at the collection site had her removed, but she continued inspecting facilities elsewhere in the region and found similar cross-contamination.

“My own investigation found hepatitis C antibody positive rate to be as high as 84.3%. Being a doctor, I was very anxious,” she wrote. “I knew that hepatitis C and HIV had the same routes of infection. . . . I didn’t want to sit in the office of the Health Bureau waiting for the arrival of an AIDS epidemic. I wanted to directly monitor it and prevent it.”

She was joined in her efforts by Gao Yaojie, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Henan province, also later exiled to the United States, who became one of the country’s most prominent AIDS activists.

“Together the two women started a campaign — Wang behind the scenes with facts and information and Gao out front with a steely resolve and charisma — that shook China’s faith in its health system and government,” Kathleen McLaughlin, a journalist who covered the scandal, wrote in an account published in the London Guardian last year.

Using her own money, Dr. Wang began testing blood samples for HIV and found an infection rate of 13 percent. After she took the samples to Beijing, she found herself frozen out by local and provincial health leaders, who stood to be embarrassed by her revelations. A man she described as a “retired leader of the Health Bureau” came to her testing site and smashed her sign with a baton. When she tried to stop him from destroying her equipment, he struck her.

In 1996, the collection sites were shut down and reopened with HIV testing for donors. “I felt very gratified,” Dr. Wang wrote, “because my work helped to protect the poor.” But she continued to face intimidation. Her clinical testing center was ultimately closed and the utilities cut off, resulting in the loss of all the samples she had collected.

She found work in Beijing before coming to the United States in 2001, the same year that a senior Chinese government official conceded for the first time that the country had a “very serious epidemic of H.I.V.-AIDS” and that coverup efforts by local officials had contributed to its spread. In an interview after Dr. Wang’s death, Wan Yanhai, a prominent Chinese AIDS activist also exiled to the United States, commended her as a health scientist who “took responsibility . . . to tell the truth.”

Zou Shuping was born Oct. 20, 1959, in Fugou County, Henan province. Her mother was a village physician, and her father was a math teacher.

During the Cultural Revolution, Dr. Wang recalled watching her parents be forced to put on dunce caps because her father had been a soldier in the nationalist Kuomintang forces.

She was expelled from school at 8 and was readmitted only after she was adopted by an uncle, who belonged to the Communist Party, and adopted his surname, Wang. She resumed her studies, ultimately earning a medical degree and a PhD, her family said.

Her first marriage, in China to Honghai Geng, ended in divorce amid her whistleblowing campaign. In the United States, she married Christensen in 2005. Besides her husband, of Salt Lake City, survivors include a daughter from her first marriage, Samantha Geng of Tucson; two children from her second marriage, Julie Zou of Bethesda, Md., and David Zou of Salt Lake City; and a brother.

After Dr. Wang’s death, David Cowhig, a retired U.S. Foreign Service officer assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing from 1996 to 2001, wrote on his blog, “Now it can be told: Shuping Wang . . . was also the single most important source” for U.S. officials seeking to understand and curb the HIV epidemic in China.

“She provided rock-solid, highly sensitive internal information about the HIV epidemic and the Chinese leadership’s disappointingly weak response,” he wrote. “That in turn seized the attention of the Clinton White House.”

In the United States, Dr. Wang did medical research in Milwaukee and later at the University of Utah.

“I have since been working over 10 hours every day,” she wrote in her 2012 account of her life. “Hard as it is, I have learned a lot of new technologies and techniques. I am still hoping that, one day, I will be able to apply my experience and skills to serve the Chinese people.”"

Among the companies Shokin said was in his sights: Ukrainian natural gas company named Burisma Holdings. A year earlier, then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, had joined the Burisma board and was also at a law firm retained by Burisma’s owner, former Ukrainian government official Mykola Zlochevsky.

Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine’s shadows.

By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.

The Trump-Zelensky rough transcript, annotated

“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair,” Trump told Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a July 25 call, according to a rough transcript released Wednesday by the White House. “A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.”

Trump has claimed that Joe Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Shokin because he was investigating Burisma.

But the investigation had already been set aside when Biden acted. Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

Shokin was named prosecutor general in February 2015, one year after Viktor Yanukovych, the country’s president at the time, fled the country for Russia following street protests and violent clashes in the capital, Kiev.

Western officials hoped Shokin would aggressively prosecute the extensive corruption — reportedly totaling in the tens of billions of dollars — that authorities uncovered among Yanukovych and his associates.

Public opinion swiftly turned against Shokin, however. He was seen as insufficiently pursuing, and in some instances hindering, cases against the Yanukovych-era officials.

Among these was an investigation into Zlochevsky, Yanukovych’s minister for ecology and natural resources.

In 2014, authorities in Britain froze $23 million linked to Zlochevsky as part of a case against him for alleged money laundering. Shokin’s predecessor, Vitaly Yarema, failed to provide documents requested by British officials, and the money was released in the beginning of 2015.

In September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt gave a speech in which he criticized Shokin for his failure to actively combat corruption.

Calls for Shokin’s dismissal grew through 2015. However, they were resisted by then-President Petro Poroshenko, who had appointed Shokin and with whom he shared a close relationship.

To pressure Poroshenko to dismiss Shokin, the Obama administration threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees.

In March 2016, Shokin was dismissed.

Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was “wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.”

Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.

“Instead of deciding to let the voters decide, they ran to the courts,” Johnson accused.

[U.K. Supreme Court rules Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally]

Pointing at Corbyn across the dispatch boxes, Johnson asked: “Is he going to dodge a vote of no confidence in me as prime minister in order to escape the verdict of the voters? Does he in his heart even want to be prime minister anymore?”

“What are they scared of?” Johnson wondered aloud, turning then to the smaller opposition parties — the Greens, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party — and asking whether any of them might “fancy a go?”

Corbyn rose to call Johnson “a dangerous prime minister who thinks he’s above the law.”

Corbyn, the 70-year-old socialist who would run as Labour’s standard-bearer, raised his chin toward Johnson, saying: “I want a general election. If he wants an election, get an extension and let’s have an election.”

Corbyn wants to avoid an abrupt and chaotic exit from the European Union on Oct. 31 without a deal to manage the withdrawal — as Johnson has threatened.

There’s also a political calculation. Corbyn wants to keep Johnson locked in a kind of limbo — neither letting him fulfill his promise to bust loose from the E.U., nor letting him dissolve the government and potentially win back a majority in an election.

[In or out? Labour Party remains tortuously conflicted over Brexit and leader Jeremy Corbyn.]

Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a think tank, said Labour’s play is a good short-term strategy. “Boris is twisting in the wind,” Grant said. “He’s in office, but not in power. He can’t pass legislation. He can’t call an election.”

But Grant said that if it goes on for too long “it might damage Labour — people will say, ‘It’s ridiculous. We’re not being governed. We need a proper government, and that requires an election.’ ”

The calendar is challenging. If a no-confidence vote were held this week, lawmakers would have until the second week of October to form a viable alternative government. By then, they would be just days away from when the prime minister — whoever is in the job — is by law supposed to ask the E.U. for an extension.

Corbyn would no doubt prefer Johnson to be the one to have to ask for another delay, breaking his “do or die” pledge. That would spare Corbyn from being accused of “dither and delay” in a coming election.

But opposition parties would also be wary that if a no-confidence vote succeeded now, Britain could face the Brexit deadline at a moment when it’s not clear who is in charge.

The earliest an election could happen would be mid-November.

And so the prime minister and Parliament are likely to continue to clash in the weeks to come.

Wednesday was one of the most raucous sessions in recent memory, with Conservative Party members bursting into applause — this is very much against the rules — and opposition backbenchers shouting at Johnson to resign.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who had advised Johnson that the suspension of Parliament was legal, brushed aside calls for his own ouster, saying, “If I was called upon to resign every time I lost a case, I’d never have a practice.”

Cox then exploded at law­makers for their inaction.

“This is a dead Parliament,” he said. “It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.”

“But the time is coming,” he warned, his booming voice rising above the wild cheering and jeering. “The time is coming, Mr. Speaker, when even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas!”

Labour lawmaker Barry Sheerman later rose and, with beet-red face, stabbing his finger toward Cox, shouted: “No shame today! No shame at all! . . . For a man like him, a party like this, and a leader like this — this prime minister — to talk about morals and morality is a disgrace.”

For his part, Johnson called the gathering “a zombie parliament” with an “obsessive desire to overrule the referendum result.”

“I thought we were coming to hear a statement on the Supreme Court judgment,” said Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker who helped launch the case. “But instead we’ve been treated to the sort of populist rant one expects to hear from the leader of a tin-pot dictatorship or perhaps the current president of the States.”

Johnson repeatedly called the bill that will require him to seek a Brexit delay a “surrender act” and was taken to task for his use of “inflammatory” language.

Paula Sherriff, a Labour lawmaker, said many politicians were “subject to death threats and abuse every single day and let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words ‘surrender act, betrayal, traitor.’ ”

The man who murdered pro-E.U. British lawmaker Jo Cox in 2016 had described her as a “traitor.”

Johnson responded to Sherriff that he had “never heard such humbug in all my life.”

House Speaker John Bercow tried to calm the ensuing scenes, shouting “Order!” no less than 12 times in a row.

Who is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky?,"This article has been updated.

Volodymyr Zelensky had absolutely no political experience when he became Ukraine’s president after an April election he won in a landslide.

But his unexpected rise to power in some ways mirrored the trajectory of the character he was known for playing on TV: Vasyl Holoborodko, a schoolteacher who is elected president after one of his students records him ranting against government corruption and the video goes viral.

Zelensky, 41, became a star in Ukraine for headlining the popular series, called “Servant of the People,” since 2015.

Now, he finds himself facing a new level of international scrutiny in his job in real life, meeting with President Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday.

[Official readout: President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky]

Earlier in the day, the White House released a rough transcript of a phone call between the two presidents. The July conversation between Trump and Zelensky is at the center of a huge controversy in Washington, after a whistleblower raised concerns about the call and the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community said what the whistleblower described could have amounted to a violation of campaign finance law.

As The Washington Post reported, senior Justice Department officials have said prosecutors determined Trump’s conduct did not amount to a criminal offense. But on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, accusing him of violating the Constitution in seeking help from a foreign leader to damage a political opponent. Trump confirmed a Washington Post report Tuesday that in mid-July he ordered the withholding of almost $400 million in aid to Ukraine, but that it was not part of an effort to coerce any action.

The memo released Wednesday showed that Trump asked Zelensky to cooperate with the U.S. attorney general to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, who worked on Ukraine issues while serving in the Obama administration. He is now a leading Democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential race.

Speaking next to Trump at the U.N. Wednesday, Zelensky denied he had been pressured during the call. “Nobody pushed me,” he said.

The Obama administration took a hard line against Ukrainian corruption, with Biden joining other Western leaders calling for the removal of the nation’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was seen as not being aggressive enough. Biden even threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not remove Shokin.

[The full Trump-Ukraine timeline — as of now]

Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was serving on the board of a Ukrainian-owned energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose owner, oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, was a subject of one of the corruption probes. This raised speculation in some circles that the elder Biden was trying to ensure Shokin didn’t follow through with any investigation into that company, though no evidence has emerged that proves that was the case.

Shokin was ousted by the Ukrainian parliament in March 2016, more than three years before Zelensky took office as president. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have claimed that the investigation into Burisma was not ongoing when Shokin was forced out.

According to the transcript released by the White House on Wednesday, which is not a verbatim report of the call, Zelensky took a relatively light tone during the conversation, in which Trump congratulated him for his party’s win in parliamentary elections. Zelensky, a professional comedian, joked that he only heard from Trump when he had won an election.

“I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often,” the memo describes him as saying. He also flattered Trump, telling him that his campaign put to use lessons they learned from Trump’s own presidential run in 2016.

During the call, Zelensky mimicked some of Trump’s own terminology, saying he wanted “drain the swamp” to eliminate corruption in Ukraine as Trump often says about Washington. He also told Trump the last time he visited New York, he stayed at Trump Tower and repeatedly assured Trump has “friends” in Ukraine.

Trump told Zelensky he wanted him to speak with Attorney General William P. Barr about the tough stance Biden took on Shokin. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me,” Trump said, according to the memo.

A number of Democrats are now backing plans to begin an impeachment inquiry, citing Trump’s request that a foreign leader help him investigate Biden, one of his political rivals.

Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the Wilson Center, said she was not particularly surprised by Zelensky’s approach on the call. “He’s a showman, he understands how flattery works,” she said. “He knew exactly what to say to make President Trump’s ears perk up.

“I think he was willing to do what was necessary to secure that aid, plain and simple, and to stay on Trump’s good side,” she said.

In some ways, Jankowicz said, Zelensky’s unexpected emergence in the spotlight the same week he flew to New York for his first appearance at the U.N. General Assembly could be an opportunity for him to get more attention than he would have otherwise. “He might be able to come out at least if not unscathed then relatively unscathed,” she said.

Zelensky, who founded the multimillion-dollar production company Studio Kvartal 95, brought business experience and media savvy to his new role as president — but not much else. Still, on the campaign trail, he promised to fix some of Ukraine’s most stubborn problems, such as deeply entrenched corruption and the five-year conflict with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 13,000 people.

He also promised to keep Ukraine on a path toward joining the European Union and said he would want any decision to join NATO to be voted upon through a national referendum.

His pledges were enough to help him oust the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire who made his fortune in the confectionery business. During a debate against Poroshenko, Zelensky — himself a wealthy celebrity — said he is “just a simple person who came to break the system.”

His political party, named for his TV series, managed to seat 254 lawmakers in a snap general election this summer. Like Zelensky, all of them are political newcomers: Not a single one had served in parliament before, and the party organized a special boot camp for them to learn the ins and outs of politics.

It was after that election that Trump called to congratulate Zelensky, his office said at the time — the same phone call that is now at the center of the standoff in Washington.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that John E. Herbst served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009. He served from 2003 to 2006.

After trading some political pleasantries with Ukraine’s new leader, President Trump began to make his case that the United States was an indispensable friend.

“We do a lot for Ukraine,” Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call, according to a rough transcript made public by the White House on Wednesday.

Trump gave no specifics of the United States’ assistance in the call, but went on to bash European allies — and Germany’s Angela Merkel in particular — as not doing enough to aid Ukraine.

But now the entire U.S. aid package to Ukraine — almost $400 million — has become a key exhibit in possible impeachment probes. On Tuesday, Trump acknowledged he ordered the aid withheld during the summer before making the July call with Zelensky, who was encouraged by Trump to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

[Trump ordered hold on military aid days before calling Ukrainian president, officials say]

Since the early 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States has consistently supplied foreign aid to Ukraine, partly to foster the pro-Western political and military links in a key country bordering Russia.

“Our efforts have been designed to promote stability, to protect the integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, and to help it reform,” said John E. Herbst, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2003 to 2006 and is the director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council.

Although the United States is one of the country’s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine.

The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.

In 2014, after Russia annexed the region of Crimea and sparked war in Ukraine’s east, Congress enthusiastically passed legislation that imposed sanctions on Russia and increased ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. The money has provided cybersecurity and intelligence support, as well as training and equipment, to the country’s armed forces.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Trump said he had withheld aid — which was eventually released on Sept. 11 after lawmakers raised concerns — and would do it again “until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they’re not doing it.”

In a White House released transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky, both leaders complain about European countries, singling out Germany, for not doing enough to help Ukraine — though it was not clear they were specifically discussing financial assistance.

“Germany does almost nothing for you,” Trump said to Zelensky, according to the transcript. ""All they do is talk and I think it’s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything.”

Zelensky told Trump he had met with the German chancellor as well as French President Emmanuel Macron and told them that they were not enforcing sanctions against Russia and “not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.”

U.S. assistance (and the threat of withholding it) has played a role in efforts to root out corruption and promote transparency in a country that has long grappled with cronyism.

Viktor Yanukovych, the country’s notoriously corrupt president from 2010 to 2014, was convicted of treason by a Ukrainian court and sentenced in absentia in January to 13 years in prison. While in power, Yanukovych was widely seen as a pro-Russian puppet: The court ruled that he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine and that he violently quashed pro-Western democracy protests in Kiev.

While the protests eventually led to Yanukovych’s ouster, corruption in Ukraine remains a problem. The country scored 32 out of 100 on Transparency International’s 2018 corruption perceptions index. Zelensky, a television comedian with no prior political experience, won the presidency in part by promising to tackle corruption.

The United States has in the past expressed concern about increasing security aid to the country because of graft.

[The full Trump-Ukraine timeline — as of now]

“We got used to assistance becoming more and more conditional,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a Kiev-based think tank. But she noted that conditions imposed in the past were about “helping Ukraine move forward and reform itself” — including encouraging the Kiev government to provide more transparency or adopt new national security measures that would further integrate it with the United States and NATO.

Thanks in part to the United States, Ukraine three weeks ago launched an anti-corruption court that aims to deal with high-level and political graft, Getmanchuk said.

But Trump’s alleged request to Zelensky, which he has denied, makes the prospect of future U.S. aid more worrying, she said.

“If those conditions are directed at making Ukraine a subject of an internal political fight, that’s not a good sign,” she said. “That’s why I’m concerned.”

Analysts worry that if Trump was acting with the investigation of his political rival in mind, the ramifications could affect Ukraine’s other bilateral relations.

The concern in Kiev could be that if it is seen as overtly cooperating with the president’s demands to launch an investigation, “another country could also seek to undermine Ukrainian ties,” said Mark D. Simakovsky, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.

“Politicizing assistance to Ukraine is very dangerous, because it will ultimately erode Ukraine’s assistance and independence at a time when it needs the United States most,” he said.

“Ukraine, unfortunately, is in the president’s crosshairs,” he added."
315,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/netanyahu-tapped-by-israels-president-to-try-forming-a-new-government/2019/09/25/9f54aa22-dfa6-11e9-be7f-4cc85017c36f_story.html,2019-09-25T21:06:00,Netanyahu tapped by Israel’s president to try forming a new government,"Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority.

But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.

“I accept the mission,” said Netanyahu, acknowledging the long struggle he is likely to face in building a majority coalition within Israel’s fractured political system. “I do this knowing that I don’t have a higher chance of forming a government but that I have less of an inability than Gantz.”

Netanyahu’s path to forming a governing coalition is lined with hazards. He has pledged to include ultra-Orthodox Jewish factions, and that probably will deter potential secular partners. He also has endorsed sharing power with Blue and White, but Gantz promised during the campaign never to join forces with Likud unless Netanyahu stepped down.

Adding to the drama and uncertainty, the prime minister faces a legal hearing Wednesday in three corruption cases involving allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The hearing could lead to his indictment.

If Netanyahu ultimately fails to assemble a majority in the Knesset, he will have to return the mandate to the president. By tradition, Gantz would then be given a chance to form a government.

Rivlin called the two candidates to his official residence two times this week in an attempt to broker a power-sharing arrangement between the major parties. But after three days of negotiations failed to produce a deal, he acted.

The president is obliged to select the candidate he thinks has the best chance of assembling a majority coalition. In a tally of recommendations from Knesset members, Netanyahu was preferred by one more member than Gantz, and Rivlin cited this slight edge.

“The probability of the prime minister forming a government is greater at this moment,” Rivlin said.

In moving so fast, Rivlin may have been looking at a difficult calendar. Israel is about to enter a period of religious holidays, with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, beginning Sunday evening, and several others to soon follow.

“He’s clearly trying to get things moving as quickly as possible,” said Jason Pearlman, a onetime media adviser to Rivlin. “[Netanyahu] has got one more recommendation than Gantz does, so it would be logical for him to take the first bite of the cheese.”

Rivlin’s choice of Netanyahu advances Israel’s complex electoral process to the next phase, but it does not move the country much closer to a resolution of the political gridlock that has consumed it for much of the year.

Netanyahu has embraced the idea of sharing power with Gantz’s party. Rotating the prime minister’s job not only would let Netanyahu extend his decade in power, but it may be his best hope of avoiding prosecution over the next months. Observers here speculate the real negotiations will come down to who takes the top job first in a unity government.

“We need this unity, this national reconciliation,” said Netanyahu. “We have been through a tough election campaign, and now we need to unite the people.”

But Gantz doubled down on his pledge not to serve with Netanyahu.

“Blue and White, led by me, does not agree to sit in a government whose leader is facing a severe indictment,” he said in a statement. “This issue, among a number of other critical factors, is more important to us than any delegation of ministerial posts or a rotation.”

Netanyahu will have at least four weeks to build a 61-seat majority, and the possible options are many. Israelis are constantly shifting through the scenarios, which range from Netanyahu and Gantz sharing the prime minister’s job to another collapse of the process, leading to Israel’s third election of the year.

As always in Israeli politics, the dealmaking is dizzying. Immediately following last week’s election, Netanyahu extracted written support from right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties.

Representatives of the two ultra-Orthodox parties — Shas and United Torah Judaism — and Yamina, a religious nationalist faction of three smaller parties, pledged support for Netanyahu in their meetings with the president Sunday and Monday. Their backing brings the number of Knesset members supporting Netanyahu to 55.

Gantz drew support from two left-wing parties, Labor and the Democratic Union, adding 11 members to the 33 from Blue and White. He also received backing for the first time in three decades from a union of Arab parties, and that gave him an additional 10 votes.

But three parliamentarians from the Arab nationalist party Balad ultimately refused to throw their support to Gantz, citing his military record in the West Bank and Gaza. Their votes proved consequential when Netanyahu prevailed by a single recommendation.

Arab parliamentarians are unlikely to be invited to join a coalition.

Hawkish former defense minister Avigdor Liberman also refused to support either candidate. In the past, Liberman, who shares the prime minister’s right-wing positions on security, has put his support behind Netanyahu. But it was Liberman’s refusal to join a government with the ultra-Orthodox parties that sent the country to an unprecedented second election. In that vote, Liberman doubled his Yisrael Beiteinu party’s presence in the Knesset, drawing eight seats. He has said that he wants to see a centrist, secular unity government between Likud and Blue and White, minimizing the influence of sectoral parties.

In safer areas, residents, workers and public officials and employees would be allowed to access the roads, but only emergency vehicles would be permitted to travel after dark.

It was not clear that the Planpincieux glacier’s collapse was imminent, and officials conceded that they had no warning system for such an event. But officials say the glacier’s precarious status was the result of a climate emergency that had already begun, and over which an international group of scientists sounded yet another alarm this week.

New U.N. climate report: Massive change already here for world’s oceans and frozen regions

“These phenomena testify once again how the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,” the mayor of Courmayeur, Stefano Miserocchi, said in a statement. “In this case it is a temperate glacier particularly sensitive to high temperatures.”

Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte echoed the mayor’s comments.

“It is now news that a glacier on Mont Blanc risks collapsing,” Conte said. “It’s an alarm that cannot leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and mobilize us.”

Discussion of the impending climate catastrophe dominated the first days of the annual U.N. meeting in New York. The week kicked off with teen climate activist Greta Thunberg’s passionate call for world leaders to take significant action on climate change.

On Wednesday, the organization’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released yet another ominous report about the effects already underway.

The mysterious lost continent that helped form the Alps

“Glaciers, snow, ice and permafrost are declining and will continue to do so,” the scientists wrote in a statement accompanying the report. “This is projected to increase hazards for people, for example through landslides, avalanches, rockfalls and floods.”

“Smaller glaciers found for example in Europe, eastern Africa, the tropical Andes and Indonesia are projected to lose more than 80% of their current ice mass by 2100 under high emission scenarios,” the statement continued. That glacial loss would “continue to adversely affect recreational activities, tourism, and cultural assets.”

The glaciers in the Alps provide vital water and meet the hydroelectric needs of the region and play a key role in tourism. But under a limited global warming scenario, these frozen resources could lose two-thirds of their volume by the end of the century, according to a study published in April in the Cryosphere journal. Under a stronger global warming model, the researchers, based in Switzerland, projected that the Alps’s glaciers would disappear almost entirely by 2100.

The melting process is already underway. On Sunday, hundreds of people gathered in Switzerland to mourn the Pitzol glacier. It had lost 80 to 90 percent of its volume since 2006.

The meeting is a high-wire act for both leaders as Zelensky tries to avoid angering the U.S. president or his Democratic opponents while Trump tries to disarm allegations that have generated a formal impeachment inquiry by the Democratic-controlled House.

Hours before the meeting, the White House released the transcript of the call, which included Trump offering to meet Zelensky at the White House following Zelensky's promise to conduct an inquiry.

The White House and Democrats have taken opposing views of the call. Democratic Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said the transcript “reads like a classic mob shakedown.” White House officials said that the document does not show the president seeking an investigation of Biden’s son in exchange for providing aid to Ukraine, and that accusations the president offered a quid pro quo to undermine a political rival are untrue.

“There was no pressure whatsoever,” Trump told reporters Wednesday.

Days before the phone call, Trump ordered a hold on about $400 million of military aid for Ukraine, which has been fending off Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east.

Trump had denied the suggestion that he linked the disbursement of U.S. military aid to Ukraine’s willingness to investigate Biden’s son, saying Tuesday that he withheld the aid over a concern that European countries were not contributing enough to help support Ukraine.

“My complaint has always been, and I’d withhold again, and I’ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they’re not doing it,” Trump told reporters.

In the transcript, Trump repeatedly emphasizes that the United States has been very generous to Ukraine and other European countries have not.

Zelensky is just one of a dozen leaders Trump is meeting in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, but the tête-à-tête became a focal point of the global gathering after a whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community raised allegations about Trump’s behavior.

Administration officials are discussing the possibility of providing the complaint to Congress in the coming days.

[Trump offered Ukrainian president Justice Dept. help for Biden investigation, memo shows]

“For the Ukrainians, this is a nightmare,” said Sam Charap, a Russia expert at the Rand Corp. “They are in damage-control mode: trying to minimize the controversy and not openly embracing one or another U.S. partisan position. They want Trump’s support in his capacity as president of the United States but do not want to be seen as partisan.”

John Herbst, a Ukraine expert at the Atlantic Council, said the two leaders have an incentive to conduct a “calm and peaceful meeting,” but anything is possible.

“Both sides have an interest in stressing that they have a good formal relationship: Zelensky because he needs a relationship with the United States and President Trump because the events of the past several days have cast a cloud over him, and he needs to demonstrate that he and Zelensky get along.”

“Sometimes President Trump is impulsive, so we can’t be certain of what happens,” he added.

Whatever apprehensions the Ukrainians may have, Trump in recent days had expressed confidence to his aides that the transcript would eventually be released and would embarrass his critics and political opponents, according to people familiar with the matter.

Since the release of the tape, the White House has distributed talking points to lawmakers calling any suggestion of a quid pro quo a “myth.” But some officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, worried about the wisdom of release the transcript.

“It’s an incredible miscalculation,” one of the critics of releasing the transcript said.

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry of the president, dramatically raising the stakes and setting up a constitutional clash between Congress and the executive branch.

“The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said.

Even before the transcript was released, Trump admitted that he asked Zelensky to probe Biden’s son, who has connections to a business that was under investigation, but he denied exerting any pressure on him.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

A stark new report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this time focused on how human activities are reshaping the planet’s oceans and frozen regions, warns of sweeping changes already taking place from the deepest depths of the sea to glaciers vanishing from mountain peaks. This is the first IPCC report to focus on water and comes amid a week of climate diplomacy and related meetings at the United Nations in New York City.

The report, written by 104 authors from 36 countries and approved by government representatives on Sept. 24, increases sea level rise projections by the end of the century by about 4 inches when compared to the last IPCC report, which was released in 2014. It also explicitly mentions the possibility that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse entirely in the next few centuries or less, which would set into motion multiple meters of sea level rise.

“For the first time ever, the IPCC has produced an in-depth report exploring the furthest corners of the world,” said Ko Barrett, an IPCC vice chair and an official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

“We’ve found that even and especially in these places, global warming is evident,” she said during a call with reporters on Monday.

‘Unprecedented’ changes in the oceans

The report paints a dire picture of the planet’s oceans under assault from increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, which are heating waters, disrupting ecosystems, raising sea levels and causing the oceans to become more acidic and less productive.

“Over the 21st century, the ocean is projected to transition to unprecedented conditions with increasing temperatures, greater upper ocean stratification, further acidification, oxygen decline, and altered net primary production,” the report states.

In other words, the oceans of our future will be starkly different from what we grew up with, and societies dependent on marine ecosystems for sustenance and livelihoods could be buffeted by food shortages and loss of income.

Marine ecosystems are forecast to undergo massive shifts, with plant and animal communities moving long distances to find the water temperatures and nutrients that best sustain them. Coastal wetlands are particularly threatened by rising sea levels, the report found.

In addition, “extreme” El Niño and La Niña events are likely to occur, along with a sharp increase in the frequency, duration, spatial extent and maximum temperature of marine heat waves. The report projects a 20- to 50-fold increase in marine heat waves, depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions. Marine heat waves, such as the developing “Blob” in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, can significantly alter the weather over land.

[The ‘Blob’ is surging back in the Pacific, leading to fears of mass die-offs of marine life and unusual weather patterns]

A Pacific marine heat wave in the northeast Pacific during the 2014-2016 period was tied to the severe California drought, for example.

The oceans have been taking in more than 90 percent of the extra heat from greenhouse gases, which is warming waters worldwide, the report shows. Since 1993, the rate of ocean warming has likely doubled, the report found.

By 2100, the IPCC report says, the top 6,500 feet of the ocean are projected to absorb five to seven times more heat under a high-emissions scenario, compared with two to four times more heat if the world enacts swift and strict limits on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“The ocean has been acting like a sponge, absorbing carbon dioxide and heat … but it can’t keep up,” Barrett said. “The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe.”

Sea level rise: 100-year floods to become annual events

The era of accelerating sea level rise is already upon us. Mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet during the 2007-2016 period tripled when compared with 1997 to 2006, and the loss rate for the Greenland Ice Sheet doubled during the same period as well.

While sea level has risen globally by around six inches during the 20th century, it is currently rising more than twice as fast, the report found. This is leading to an uptick in “extreme sea level events” in coastal areas.

The report shows increased continued mass losses from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets throughout the 21st century and beyond, but notes that the rate of ice loss can still be reduced by cutting emissions before 2050.

The sea level rise projections in the new report are more in line with recent studies than with the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report that came out in 2014, in that the new report has about four additional inches of sea level rise by 2100 under a high-emissions scenario, for a total of more than three feet. The report mentions the possibility of multiple meters of sea level rise during the next few centuries if, as some studies show, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapses. Recent studies have shown increasing signs of fragility in East Antarctica, too.

Due to sea level rise, the report finds that sea level rise would cause floods that had occurred about once in 100 years to take place annually by 2050 in many coastal megacities and small island developing states.

Permafrost is melting — quickly

In recent years, scientists have observed increased levels of permafrost melt in the Arctic, which has the potential to release large amounts of stored carbon, methane and other greenhouse gases that had been trapped in the frozen ground. The IPCC report does not offer good news on this front, either.

By 2100, a high-emissions scenario would yield “the cumulative release of tens to hundreds of billions of tons of permafrost carbon,” thereby accelerating global warming further. Lower-emissions scenarios would cut down on the amount of permafrost lost, however, and limit a positive feedback that can exacerbate global warming.

The report comes two days after a major U.N. climate summit that failed to deliver major new emissions reduction pledges from the world’s biggest emitters, including China and the United States."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) initiated an impeachment inquiry against Trump on Tuesday, after the president ­acknowledged that he urged Ukraine’s leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

With Washington in an entrenched state of partisan division, and the Trump administration’s relations with allies and adversaries mired in mistrust, experts said the specter of further U.S. political paralysis would have minimal immediate impact globally.

Still, the developments weighed on financial markets, already hit by concerns about global economic weakness and the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.

Here is how people around the world assessed the latest U.S. political shootout, which Trump derided as a “witch hunt” and “harassment” by House Democrats.

China

Impeachment proceedings are likely to take a long time, so they will have little impact, if any, on the trade talks with China, said Yao Xinchao, a professor of trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.

“The odds of Trump getting impeached by the end of 2019 are very slim,” Yao said. “Of course, Trump getting reelected would further dim the prospects for China-U.S. relations. It would reinforce his conviction that taking a hard line against China pays off, and allow him to cast off his already few misgivings in making irresponsible decisions.”

Still, Beijing wants a swift end to the trade war and would not like a prolonged period of uncertainty, he said.

But China would welcome any effort to oust Trump, said Wu Qiang, a political scientist who was forced to resign from Tsinghua University because of his critical writings.

“Xi wants Trump out and has been trying to achieve that through a lot of propaganda, string-pulling and even secret political intervention,” Wu said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping and to frustration over the trade dispute.

“That said, I don’t think a Democratic president or other alternatives would bring radical changes to Washington’s China policy. The wind has turned against Beijing and will stay that way for much longer,” Wu added.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to respond to the impeachment news, telling reporters that it was “an internal matter for the United States.”

Germany and France

After more than two years, many continental Europeans have grown weary of talk of impeaching Trump, even if they may support it.

Despite the risks for the Democrats and the challenges any impeachment move would face in the Senate, the conservative newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung argued that the decision to announce an inquiry was necessary. “What would it mean for democracy if a majority in the House of Representatives refrained from even trying to take action?” the paper’s former U.S. correspondent, Andreas Ross, wrote.

There was widespread skepticism over the likelihood of success of an impeachment inquiry. “It’s certainly too early for farewells,” the German magazine Der Spiegel commented on its website.

In France, the tone of coverage mostly played up the uncertainty of the proceedings at this early stage, too. “The United States is engaged in the unknown,” the prominent French daily Le Monde wrote in the lead of its story on the impeachment inquiry.

In continental Europe, few would miss Trump as president. “All parties apart from the [far-right] AfD party would be jolly glad if the Trump presidency was over,” Stephan Bierling, an international politics professor at the University of Regensburg in Germany, said in an email. “The faster, the better.”

But Bierling also acknowledged that some of the reasons for continental Europe’s welcoming stance toward possible impeachment proceedings were debatable. Some of Trump’s criticism of Europe — including his attacks on Germany over its low defense spending — has been backed by analysts. German leaders may hope that post-Trump, it might become easier for them to “duck again,” Bierling said.

Britain

In Britain, the announcement of an impeachment inquiry was largely overshadowed by the historic ruling of the United Kingdom’s Supreme Court on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s suspension of Parliament was unlawful.

“[Many] people see so many parallels between Trump and Johnson as populist, would-be strongmen who flout the rules and seem to get away with it — at least until now,” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said in an email.

“Often these days, there’s a huge Brexit news story in the morning, and then a huge story on Trump in the afternoon,” said Jacob Parakilas, an associate at LSE Ideas, a foreign policy think tank.

With the impeachment inquiry announcement, there is a possibility of both stories colliding.

Trump has been one of the most vocal foreign advocates of Brexit, and his assurances that Britain would be able to speedily negotiate a trade deal with the United States were especially welcomed by hard-line Brexiteers. As Britain continues to face the possibility of a no-deal Brexit with severely negative economic repercussions, such a trade deal would be crucial.

But analysts doubted how much sway Trump ever had over future negotiations — and whether impeachment would matter in this context.

“Given the scale of the challenges facing British policymakers at this point, I’m not convinced that the impeachment articles that will be considered by the Judiciary Committee are actually going to make an enormous difference on this side,” said Ursula Hackett, a politics researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Parakilas added that impeachment proceedings would make it even less likely for Congress to approve a trade deal with Britain, but lawmakers’ support was unlikely even before Tuesday’s announcement.

South Korea

In this U.S.-allied East Asian country, experts said domestic pressure on Trump might spur him to seek a quick resolution on North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong Un, the U.S. president has repeatedly praised. Trump said recently he might meet Kim again soon, while South Korea has said talks between the two sides might resume in two to three weeks.

“His engagement with North Korea has produced achievements that are highly visible. He could turn to a diplomatic event with North Korea to divert attention away from domestic political challenges,” said Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.

Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, noted, though, that impeachment proceedings could have the opposite effect and push Trump to become more bellicose toward Kim Jong Un. He noted that the failed February summit with the North Korean leader in Hanoi, where Trump walked away, occurred around the same time his former lawyer Michael Cohen testified to a House committee.

“If the impeachment risk becomes a real threat for Trump, he could again walk out of a summit meeting with Kim Jong Un, to send a message to people at home,” Yang said.

India

For India, the announcement of the impeachment proceedings came at a slightly awkward moment. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a week-long visit to the United States and appeared with Trump at a rousing rally Sunday in Houston, where the two men clasped hands and traded effusive compliments.

On Tuesday, just before the news broke that the House would begin impeachment proceedings, Trump was sitting down for a bilateral meeting with Modi in New York. But experts said the impeachment process was unlikely to raise eyebrows or concerns in New Delhi.

“There is very little appreciation in India of the internal dynamics of U.S. politics, just as people in the U.S. don’t appreciate India’s internal politics,” said Varghese George, the author of a new book on U.S.-India relations under Modi and Trump.

Given that a sizable proportion of Indian members of Parliament havefaced criminal charges, the political class is hard to shock.

“Much greater skulduggery takes place here,” said Manoj Joshi, an expert on international relations at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. The Indian government won’t “be bothered about it at all.”

Noack reported from Berlin and Crawshaw from Hong Kong. Joanna Slater in New Delhi, Lyric Li in Beijing, James McAuley in Paris and Min Joo Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.

In August, Facebook suspended 350 accounts and pages for promoting Saudi state propaganda and attacking Saudi Arabia’s regional rivals. In October 2018, Twitter suspended thousands of bot accounts spreading favorable messages about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the height of the furor over the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Twitter’s other suspensions in the region have tended to focus on accounts linked to the Iranian government.

Though overdue, these suspensions are unlikely to affect the deluge of social media propaganda in the region. The accounts suspended are actually fairly small in relation to the amount of suspected accounts spreading disinformation in Arabic. Indeed, the number of fake accounts may be in the millions. And as the Khashoggi murder showed, it is also important to remember that disinformation is often produced and disseminated by state-approved institutions.

Analyzing the data

Who exactly were behind these recently suspended accounts, and what were they saying? I analyzed the data that Twitter released to the public and found some intriguing trends.

Between January 2017 and May 2019, the about 4,500 accounts produced over 1 million tweets and retweets. Over half of all tweets were posted in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. The tweets point to an influence campaign on a global scale, with accounts tweeting in multiple languages, including English, Arabic, Spanish, Russian and Japanese.

The modus operandi of the accounts was varied, but all were designed to deceive the casual Twitter user. Some of the suspended accounts masqueraded as independent English-language news sites.

One of the six Saudi accounts banned was a news site called “the Globus” and even had a verified Twitter account. This account had even been previously linked to a pro-Trump information operation trying to denounce the special counsel report as a “Russiagate hoax.”

Other accounts purported to be real individuals with profile photos, such as “Sara Bitar,” who claimed to have a master’s degree in political and economic science.

“Yemen,” “Qatar” and “Houthis” were among the most commonly appearing words. Many accounts also leveled criticism at the Muslim Brotherhood and Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup — both maligned by the Saudi and Emirati regimes. Other accounts praised the Saudi crown prince.

The common thread, though, was boosting the legitimacy of the Saudi-led war on Yemen, while also promoting Saudi and Emirati foreign policy via the demonization of Qatar, the Houthis and Iran. The accounts, a mixture of human-operated (trolls) and automated accounts (bots), also engaged in an increasingly common tactic on Twitter: mass-messaging Western media outlets and U.S. officials, including President Trump.

Suspending the ‘Lord of the Flies’

Most of the suspended accounts were not prominent, except one: that of Saud al-Qahtani. A former adviser to the Saudi royal court and the general supervisor of the Center for Studies and Information Affairs, Qahtani was implicated in Khashoggi’s October killing and the United States imposed sanctions on him. Widely regarded as Mohammed’s confidant, Qahtani is considered the architect of Saudi Arabia’s malicious digital media campaign, procuring bots and spyware to target perceived critics of the country.

To suspend Qahtani now, allegedly for “platform manipulation,” when he has not tweeted since October, is unusual. It has been suggested that Twitter may have found evidence linking Qahtani to an operation against critics of Saudi’s leaders, but Qahtani’s reputation as “Lord of the Flies” began way back, during the Persian Gulf crisis in 2017. He endangered the lives of people when he initiated a Twitter blacklist to name and shame sympathizers of Qatar and promote regime change.

Oddly, despite providing an archive of the tweets from suspended accounts, Twitter has not provided Qahtani’s archive. Twitter claims there was no evidence that his account was linked to broader information operations, yet open-source investigations have suggested Qahtani was the main orchestrator of such tactics. It is possible his tweets are not being released for other reasons, such as an ongoing investigation.

A plague of Twitter bots is roiling the Middle East

Why now?

Although 4,500 accounts may seem like a lot, the number is a drop in the ocean compared with the number of accounts suspended without publicity. Studies show there are probably millions of fake accounts promoting political propaganda and hate speech in the region.

From pro-Russian Turkish bots, to accounts with links to the Iranian government, the region is being roiled by multiple, competing influence campaigns. But most of the time, there is no smoking gun, and attribution to a specific actor is difficult.

Despite its reputation for malicious behavior, Saudi Arabia has rarely been publicly rebuked by Twitter, so the recent action by Twitter is likely to be political. Indeed, with the impending anniversary of Khashoggi’s death likely to generate a lot of propaganda, Twitter wishes to appear proactive in tackling information operations.

The account suspension is more symbolic than anything else. Twitter probably hopes that the account suspensions will bring in a new era of a less toxic Arabic Twitter. This is unlikely to happen. The reality is that it is easy to set up a Twitter account. Like a game of whack-a-mole, suspended fake accounts will be replaced by more sophisticated efforts at deception.

It took almost two months for anyone to notice.,"But on Monday, police finally made it to the Sonoda dorm at the suburban campus outside Christchurch, New Zealand, where authorities discovered the body of a first-year student, local media reported. The student’s father, who could not reach the young man through his friends, had also contacted police.

The young man’s body had gone untouched for so long that police had to call in a special team to examine fingerprints, DNA and dental records so they could confirm his identity, Detective Senior Sgt. Craig Johnson told reporters. Most details surrounding the incident, including the student’s name and age, had not been made public as of early Wednesday, and the coroner is still investigating the cause of death.

Amid an outcry from university students that’s gone all the way up to New Zealand’s education minister this week, a university is grappling with a grim question: How could a dead student go undiscovered for so long?

For now, no one really seems to know.

“It is inconceivable to imagine how these circumstances could have occurred,” Cheryl de la Rey, the university’s vice chancellor, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

De la Rey said Wednesday that the university will commission an independent investigation to examine the oversight, despite what she called an “extensive” well-being program to support students.

She declined to comment further to respect the family of the student. “This is an extremely distressing time for University students and staff,” de la Rey said.

A friend of the student’s told the Press, a Christchurch newspaper, that he was a “good and confident guy” who would sometimes “go off the grid for a week or so.""

The Sonoda dorm, a leafy complex surrounded by cherry blossoms and tennis courts that houses first-year students, is one of six that’s owned by the university but managed by Campus Living Villages, an Australian company that also oversees student housing in the United States and United Kingdom. Students pay more than $10,000 a year for a single-occupancy room in the “smaller close-knit community,” which has just 108 beds, split across five-person apartments, as well as a cafeteria serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, according to its website. The dorm employs two resident assistants as well as a manager, the university said, and Campus Living Villages meets with the university every two weeks to discuss “students of concern.”

Chris Hipkins, New Zealand’s education minister, called on the university to “conduct a thorough investigation.”

“If you’re going into a hall of residence or a hostel, you are paying top dollar for not just a roof over your head but also the pastoral care that goes with that,” he told the Associated Press. “And I think clearly that’s not been present in this case.”

Sam Brosnahan, the University of Canterbury’s student body president, said the death had distressed students on the usually peaceful campus.

“It’s generally well regarded by students as a safe place to learn, study and live,” he told the AP.

But Bex Bryan, a former resident adviser at the university, said in a Facebook post she found it “unbelievable” it took so long to find the dead student. She had daily contact with students, planned weekend activities and knew who was away when.

The dorms “have certainly taken a dive since my days,” she said, “evidenced by the litter and general behaviour of students there at night.”"

On the top floor of a run-down studio, the young sculptors were scraping away at plaster bas-reliefs, in many cases re-creating Western masterpieces they may never see.

Nimer Qeeq, a 23-year-old hipster in tight black jeans, said Michelango’s “Pietà” would be the first thing he’d aim to see if he ever leaves the 25-mile strip of land that has circumscribed his life. “The details of that statue,” he said, “how Mary holds Jesus, the details on her arm — it’s really perfect.”

Jamila Sawalah, 22, dreams of seeing van Gogh. “The violent nature of the brushstrokes — I love that style, and I try to do the same.” She dashed paint onto her sculpture of a couple in a passionate embrace.

It is often said that art is a means of escape. But in Gaza — an overcrowded and squalid enclave that residents cannot leave without great difficulty — there is no escape. Art here is a means of weathering an increasingly oppressive reality, of learning to find, or create, beauty in the most hostile environments.

Gazans live under a strict blockade imposed by both Israel and Egypt to exert pressure on Hamas, the Islamist militant group that has controlled the Palestinian enclave since 2007.

A group of artists from Shabakeek, one of the only artist collectives and gallery spaces in the Gaza Strip, is now organizing a traveling retrospective of Gaza-made art. It is to be shown first in East Jerusalem in late December, then in the West Bank city of Ramallah and then, tentatively, in Frankfurt sometime in 2020.

But because of travel restrictions imposed by Israel, the artists may not be able to secure the permits necessary to leave Gaza.

“Our art is traveling, but not us,” said Shareef Serhan, a painter and sculptor who now runs Shababeek. “It’s very difficult for the artists, including me, that you’re not there with your art. You can’t visualize the impression it makes on viewers. You can’t see the impact and feeling of people toward your art.”

Israeli military officials said in a statement that there is no attempt to keep artists from accompanying their art. “When any request is received by the Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA) for Gaza, it should be clearly understood that the request is handled on its merits, in a professional fashion, according to the criteria and subject to security considerations,” the statement said.

In recent years, rocket attacks from Gaza on Israel have brought Israeli retaliation. There have been three wars since 2009, with the most devastating in 2014, when more than 2,000 Palestinians and 67 Israelis were killed in a conflict that reduced significant expanses of the Gaza Strip to rubble.

For many artists in Gaza, that rubble has inspired a wide array of new projects.

In June 2016, Serhan completed a massive installation in the Gaza harbor of a lighthouse sculpture built entirely out of concrete blocks and steel fragments destroyed in the 2014 war. It sits in the center of a traffic circle, a new landmark on a cityscape pockmarked from artillery fire.

“In Gaza, we see many things that are broken and ugly, and we make it into something beautiful,” said Rana al-Batrawi, a Palestinian, Gaza-based sculptor whose latest project, “Clay and Ash,” relied heavily on different hues of ash she collected around Gaza City.

Batrawi said she spent a year and a half collecting the color gray wherever she could find it — from wood, the remnants of destroyed buildings and other ruins. The idea, she said, was to show that in ashes of different types, there was still an ineradicable essence.

“After every war, there is devastation,” she said. “But we keep going, and life goes on — love, marriages and so on. We have life.”

In a society controlled by Hamas, which espouses a conservative view of women and gender relations, Batrawi said that for women in particular, making art restores some of the agency otherwise denied in everyday life. “Art gives women strength, power and bravery,” she said. “Something I can’t express publicly I can express through my art.”

The image of Gaza most often transmitted abroad is one of destruction and devastation: photographs of dead bodies, broadcasts of burning homes. But these images, while reflecting much of Gaza’s reality, ultimately rob Gaza of its full humanity, Serhan said.

On a recent afternoon, one of his students, Rawan Khazeq, 20, was working on a bas-relief that depicted a Palestinian woman in traditional dress, carrying a water jug over her head.

“I want to remind everybody that we have a history, that we have a heritage,” she said.

“The majority of overseas people have an image that Gaza is a place of war,” said Serhan. “I feel I’m obligated as an artist to show what is beautiful about Gaza, and that it’s more than just a war zone.”

Asked to describe what about Gaza is beautiful, he had a list at hand: “The sea. The people. The details in certain homes and houses.”

“If you want to see the face of beautiful Gaza, you have to dig deep inside the details — it takes time,” he said. “You have to stand on the beach for four hours with a camera, watching the fishermen. Or you have to go [down] a little side street in a refugee camp, to see the beautiful eyes of the children. Or elderly women weaving at a loom.”

To that end, he shot 1,000 photographs between 2000 and 2012, which he then displayed in an exhibition — and subsequent book — both called “Gaza Lives.”

But how can artists transmit this alternate vision of Gaza to the world?

“The restriction of movement has an impact on you, and everything here is connected to that,” Serhan said.

For some artists, leaving Gaza may still be a dream, but it no longer seems realistic. Instead, they paint and sculpt without thinking about where these may lead, because the answer may be nowhere.

“Gaza is full of stress, full of pressure,” said Jamila Sawalah, another of Serhan’s students. “The most important thing for me, as we have no future, is art. Art is a way of not thinking about the future.”

NEW YORK — President Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro kicked off proceedings at the U.N. General Assembly with nationalist screeds. Bolsonaro raged against the global reaction to widespread fires in the Amazon, casting his country as a victim to manipulative activist organizations and a “lying"" foreign press.

In the heart of the world’s most important international institution, the duo hailed national sovereignty above all else — a constant theme of Trump’s three years in power and a potent narrative, as well, for the former army captain who is now Brazil’s president.

“We are not here to erase nationalities in the name of an abstract global interest,” Bolsonaro said.

“The future does not belong to the globalist,"" Trump said, following up. “It belongs to patriots.”

Other world leaders are amused by such rhetoric. In an interview with Today’s WorldView, center-left Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez lamented the effect of Trump’s leadership on the world stage. That ranges from environmental policy — Sánchez expressed dismay that “we have someone leading the United States who doesn’t believe in climate change” nor appreciates the “urgency” of the moment — to the Trump administration’s confrontation with Iran.

“The international agreement reached with the Iranian regime was very positive for the peace and security of the world,” said Sánchez, referring to the nuclear deal forged between Tehran and world powers that Trump chose to break. “It’s a pity the United States put it into question.”

Sánchez said he rejects Trump’s protectionist rhetoric on trade, particularly the administration’s decision to cast European partners as national security threats as a way to slap tariffs on some of their exports. But he expressed confidence that the transatlantic relationship can be saved, because it is “something that overcomes administrations.” On climate, he pointed to the work being done by several U.S. mayors and governors to curb emissions and build more sustainable economies, with or without federal support.

Trump’s presidency nevertheless has had a definitive effect. Echoing an argument pushed by figures such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Sánchez stressed the need for Europe to chart its own path on the world stage and move away from decades of sheltering under the umbrella of an American superpower.

“The role that Europe must play, not only here, but in the years to come,” said Sánchez, is “to create more balance” in global politics. “There was a need” for this degree of independence before, he admitted, “but it’s also true that the new position of this U.S. administration has intensified the need.”

Whether Sánchez himself will have much of a role to play in that geopolitical shift remains to be seen. After being unable to build a stable ruling coalition, Sánchez threw in the towel and called for new elections in November. Spain’s parliament dissolved this week. It’ll be the country’s fourth election in four years and the second one this year.

Sánchez’s opponents on both the far left and the center-right blame him for not wanting to work with them. But in his conversation with Today’s WorldView, he pinned the failure on his rivals for not recognizing the superior political mandate won by Sánchez and his Socialist Worker’s Party in April.

“If you use the multiparty system to block the formation of a government, this is damaging to democracy,” he said, adding that the elections in November were now “a great opportunity to overcome this blockage.”

This might be a risky bet. Spain’s fragmented political landscape will make it difficult for Sánchez to win an outright majority, even if his Socialists, the country’s traditional center-left mainstay, do claw back a few more votes from parties to its left and right.

Then there is the question of Catalonia, the wealthy northeast region where a secessionist movement triggered a constitutional crisis in 2017 by staging an independence referendum deemed illegal by Madrid. The tensions over Catalonia fanned political flames elsewhere, helping stoke the rise of Vox, a far-right party which claimed about 10 percent of the vote.

And it will probably shadow the November election, too. In October, sentences are expected for a number of Catalan separatist leaders who appeared in a publicly televised trial on charges of sedition and rebellion.

When asked by Today’s WorldView if he would consider possible pardons for the Catalan separatist leaders, Sánchez said he would “respect the work of the judicial power.” He also criticized the “undemocratic behavior” of Catalonia’s separatists, linking their demands for independence with a host of “reactionary movements” that sprang up in Europe in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

En un año, este Gobierno ha demostrado que los problemas de #España se pueden superar desde la óptica progresista. Que se puede crecer y repartir, con justicia social, que se puede gobernar con limpieza y ejemplaridad, apostando por la convivencia. pic.twitter.com/JMB4nWubuT — Pedro Sánchez (@sanchezcastejon) September 17, 2019

While Trump and Bolsonaro decried the perils of “socialism,” which the U.S. president branded “the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies,” Sánchez believes his party’s politics are necessary in an age of climate change and yawning social inequality.

“It’s important to show people a progressive manner to face these challenges,” he said, pointing to his ambitious goals for renewable energy in Spain that, as of now, have not dented his support among the traditional rural working class that earned a living in industries related to fossil fuels.

Last year, his government struck a deal with unions to shut down most of the country’s coal mines but also inject hundreds of millions of euros in investment in those regions. “We went there and spoke to them and told them we weren’t going to leave them behind and alone,” Sánchez said. “It’s very important to show people that we have to face this transition and this transition must be fair.”

It is that sort of reckoning with inequality, he suggests, that can thwart the siren song of nationalists and populists. Unlike Trump, or former Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, Sánchez has taken a welcoming approach to refugees seeking safe passage to Europe.

“Spain accepts diversity as an asset,” Sánchez declared. “We are an inclusive country.”

324,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-us-envoy-to-ottawa-calls-for-canada-to-get-seat-on-un-security-council/2019/09/24/f138c3ba-df0f-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html,2019-09-25T02:35:00,Former U.S. envoy to Ottawa wants Canada to get a seat on U.N. Security Council,"The former U.S. ambassador to Ottawa under the Obama administration on Tuesday supported Canada’s candidacy for a rotating membership on the United Nations Security Council, saying it is vital for Ottawa to be represented on the panel if President Trump wins reelection.

In unusually barbed remarks by a former ambassador to a foreign audience, Bruce Heyman gave a speech to Canadian law students that was centered on his belief that Trump is a threat to the U.S. Constitution and cannot be trusted to uphold democratic values.

Numerous ambassadors in place during the Obama administration quit in protest of Trump’s policies and wrote opinion pieces for newspapers and websites explaining their rationale. But it is extremely rare that they would air their harshest critiques in a public speech before a foreign audience. Heyman said he considered it his duty as part of his oath of office to uphold and defend the nation’s founding document.

“For me, today, when the U.N. General Assembly is all together, a Canadian seat on the U.N. Security Council is more important than ever,” Heyman said at the law school of Western University in London, Ontario.

“The world’s losing its defenders of [the] liberal democratic order of things. And I believe this increases the importance of having Canada’s seat on the Security Council. But it probably makes it harder, [with] President Trump being more transactional in supporting who gets the seat. Canada, are you willing to transact?”

Ottawa has been campaigning for a two-year membership on the Security Council beginning in 2021, for which the election will be held next year. The last time Canada held a Security Council seat was in 1999.

Heyman is a former senior Goldman Sachs executive from Chicago who served as President Barack Obama’s envoy to Canada from 2014 to 2017. He remains interested in U.S.-Canadian affairs and returns to Canada regularly to give speeches and explain the United States to Canadian audiences.

Heyman was replaced in Ottawa by Trump nominee Kelly Craft, who was later nominated to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Craft was sworn in earlier this month and is making her introductory appearance during the U.N. General Assembly underway this week.

Heyman acknowledged he plans to work hard for Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election, using fire analogies to describe a possible second Trump term. At one point he advised Canadians to look for the fire exits, as if in a fire drill.

In criticizing the Trump administration’s aggressive use of sanctions against Iran, Heyman said it was to be expected that Iran would “punch back” in retaliation. U.S. military and national security officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have blamed Iran for attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and on Saudi oil refineries.

“I think we’re playing a very dangerous game right now,” he said. “Very, very dangerous. It’s like a president who’s flicking matches in dry woods. Is it going to catch fire? I don’t know. But it’s getting more dangerous as the days go on.”

Heyman said there had been a “breakdown in trust” between the Trump administration and institutions in the United States and other countries.

“That’s what happens when one party plays by their own set of rules, but yet expects you to respect the law,” he said.

Heyman acknowledged his criticism was strong, and something he previously thought “I never would have done in a post-ambassadorial role.”

“When I swore in to preserve and protect the Constitution of the United States against enemies foreign and domestic, when my term is over as an ambassador, you don’t, like, swear out,” he said.

“I feel that I am today still under that oath,” he added. “And I feel some of the things, and many things [Trump] is doing and saying, and the way he is operating is a threat to the Constitution of the United States of America. And thus I am taking a perhaps significantly bolder step than a former ambassador would ever take.”"

He was 90.

The cause was viral pneumonia, said his literary agency, Aitken Alexander Associates.

Mr. Alvarez, who sometimes wrote under the name A. Alvarez, cultivated a reputation as a swashbuckling adrenaline seeker as well as an accomplished poet, novelist and literary critic. Finding writing to be “a solitary, joyless occupation,” he sought escape through mountaineering, boxing, poker and aviation, then drew on his hobbies for articles in the New Yorker and several books of nonfiction.

Initially, he was known for his adventurous taste in poetry and his literary attacks on the “genteel” style that dominated British poetry in the years after World War II.

In books, translations and pieces for the Observer — where he served as poetry editor from 1956 to 1966 — Mr. Alvarez introduced readers to bold new writers such as the husband-and-wife duo of Plath and Hughes, American poets John Berryman and Robert Lowell, and Eastern European poets Zbigniew Herbert and Miroslav Holub.

His 1962 Penguin anthology “The New Poetry” was a landmark work that featured poetry with a “violent impending presence,” as he put it, shadowed by the Holocaust, the threat of nuclear war and personal trauma. Along with Robert Conquest’s collection “New Lines” (1956), it became “the most discussed poetry anthology of the postwar era,” according to literary critic William Wootten’s book “The Alvarez Generation.”

Mr. Alvarez had intended to limit his anthology to British authors before deciding to begin the book with a pair of American poets, Lowell and Berryman, “in order to shame and instruct those who came after,” Wootten wrote. The anthology’s second edition included two more Americans: Anne Sexton and Plath.

Both died by suicide; Mr. Alvarez had been a friend of Plath before she killed herself in 1963, at 30. Her death led him to reflect on his own suicide attempt, in 1960, when he swallowed 45 sleeping pills as his first marriage unraveled.

Mr. Alvarez chronicled that episode in his 1971 book “The Savage God: A Study of Suicide,” which linked suicide to creativity and included one of the first substantive overviews of Plath’s life. Speculating on the reasons behind her suicide, Mr. Alvarez wrote that it was, in part, “a ‘cry for help,’ which fatally misfired.”

The book fueled public interest in Plath’s work, was attacked by Hughes (who rejected Mr. Alvarez’s analysis of his wife’s death) and marked a turn away from literary criticism for Mr. Alvarez. He later explained that he had “been down the salt mine of intellectualism, and decided it’s an excuse, really, for not being in touch with living people.”

In books such as “Feeding the Rat: A Climber’s Life on the Edge” (1988) and “Where Did It All Go Right?” (1999), Mr. Alvarez recounted his days working on “an ancient steam drifter” and a harrowing climbing expedition in which he and a companion found themselves stranded overnight, at risk of freezing to death before daybreak.

Following his curiosity to the North Sea, he spent time on oil rigs as large as the Eiffel Tower, buffeted by 100-foot waves and winds gusting 160 knots. Life on the rig, one roughneck told him for the book “Offshore” (1986), was “like going through one of those black holes from one universe to another.”

Mr. Alvarez also wrote about divorce (including his own) in the book “Life After Marriage” (1982) and published one of the first major literary works on professional poker, “The Biggest Game in Town” (1983). The book was widely credited with helping the game grow — and with spawning a wave of poker literature — and was hailed by the London Evening Standard as “probably the best book on poker ever written.”

Adapted from a New Yorker story commissioned by editor William Shawn, it chronicled the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas and introduced players such as Doyle Brunson, Mickey Appleman and Stu “The Kid” Ungar. “The chip is like a conjurer’s sleight of hand that turns an egg into a billiard ball, a necessity of life into a plaything, reality into illusion,” Mr. Alvarez wrote.

“If they had wanted you to hold on to money,” poker player Jack “Treetop” Straus told him, “they’d have made it with handles on.”

Alfred Alvarez was born in London on Aug. 5, 1929, to a family with Sephardic Jewish roots that led him to never feel “altogether English.” His mother was a homemaker, and Mr. Alvarez described his father as “a terribly bad and thwarted and unhappy business man in the schmutter trade,” or garment business.

A growth on his ankle required major surgery when he was a boy, contributing to an early sense of alienation and a determination to challenge himself outdoors. He studied at a pair of preparatory schools, the Hall in London and Oundle in Northamptonshire, before entering the University of Oxford, where he received a bachelor’s degree in 1952 and a master’s in 1956.

That same year, amid an infatuation with the work of D.H. Lawrence, he married Ursula Barr, a granddaughter of the writer’s widow, Frieda. They had met just seven weeks earlier, and as their marriage unraveled, he began playing poker, developing a decades-long habit of playing once or twice a week.

In 1966, he married Anne Adams, a Canadian child psychotherapist. In addition to his wife, survivors include their two children, Luke and Kate Alvarez; and four grandchildren. A son from his first marriage, Adam Alvarez, died in 2016.

Mr. Alvarez wrote two thrillers and the novel “Hers” (1974), about a woman married to a professor at an “ancient and famous” British university, where she has an affair with one of his students. He also wrote several short volumes of poetry, in which he addressed dreams, love and loneliness in an unadorned style.

His other books included “Poker: Bets, Bluffs and Bad Beats” (2001), the essay collection “Risky Business” (2007) and “Pondlife: A Swimmer’s Journal” (2013), about his daily swimming routine in the Hampstead Heath ponds of London, where he was accompanied in the (often bone-chilling) water by cormorants and sea gulls.

“There isn’t one word of a piece of Al Alvarez’s nonfiction that loses its voice or makes you say, ‘Wait a minute, Al, move over,’ ” New Yorker journalist Jane Kramer wrote in the introduction to “Feeding the Rat.” “On the other hand, there isn’t a word that doesn’t sound like Al talking.”"

The highly classified map shows a Colombian guerrilla camp on the southern bank of a hydroelectric plant in the picturesque foothills of the Venezuelan Andes. Allegedly led by a leftist fighter known as “Commander Lenin,” it’s one of several heavily armed outposts of combatants said to be fighting against the Colombian government while engaging in extortion, kidnapping, assassinations and drug trafficking from bases in Venezuela.

And according to Venezuela’s former intelligence chief, President Nicolás Maduro knows all about it.

Those details and others — including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil — are part of a Venezuelan intelligence report that Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera says he hand-delivered to Maduro at his Caracas residence last November.

“I gave him a folder with this and told him, ‘Look, this is the situation with the guerrillas,’ ” said the former intelligence chief, who turned against Maduro this year and is now in the United States.

“They never took action,” he said. “You could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.”

Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia’s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. Maduro’s Communications Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

The classified report — a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post — offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro’s personal knowledge of the guerrillas’ presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating.

Colombian officials are planning to make a highly charged presentation against Maduro’s government Wednesday at the U.N. General Assembly, alleging that it is evolving from a domestic threat to an international threat by harboring guerrillas they describe as “terrorists.”

Their evidence is to include photographs of Colombian guerrillas they say were taken on Venezuelan territory, and summaries of internal Venezuelan documents, some of them revealed by Colombia’s Semana magazine this month, that indicate Maduro’s government is actively providing them with military and logistical support.

Late last month, some former leaders of the FARC, the Colombian guerrilla group that waged a decades-long war against the ­Colombian government, announced they were withdrawing from a 2016 peace agreement, returning to the jungle and taking up arms again. Colombian officials claimed that their video announcement was recorded in Venezuela.

Before the announcement, Maduro appeared to publicly embrace the breakaway group’s commanders, saying in July that they were “leaders of peace” who were “welcome in Venezuela.”

The Maduro government has countercharged that opposition leader Juan Guaidó is working with right-wing Colombian criminal gangs. Maduro’s interior minister, Néstor Reverol, appeared on state television this month to show photos of Guaidó in the company of two suspected members of the Colombian ­narco-paramilitary organization Los Rastrojos, also mentioned as operating in Venezuela in the intelligence report obtained by The Post.

Guaidó has not denied the authenticity of the photos. He has said that they were taken during his brief trip to Colombia in February and that he did not know who the men were.

“We don’t ask for criminal records to take a picture,” he told reporters in Caracas.

According to the report obtained by The Post, at least 600 members of the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and the ELN, or National Liberation Army, had gathered in secret bases in the Venezuelan state of Amazonas.

The report indicates a far larger presence involved in illegal mining and other illicit operations in a broad swath of Venezuela stretching from the Caribbean coast to the southern border with Brazil. It includes photos with names and aliases of alleged guerrillas as well as Colombian narco-traffickers and criminal gang members operating in Venezuela.

“I’m not surprised,” said Francisco Santos, Colombia’s ambassador to the United States. “If anything, [the report] underestimates the current extent of the ELN. They have grown in the past year, and have felt more comfortable, because the government of Venezuela has created the conditions where they both are working to help each other in the border region.”

The mounting allegations against Maduro’s government come as the United States leads an international effort to oust the Venezuelan leader with some of the harshest economic sanctions ever imposed by Washington. Nearly a dozen Western Hemisphere nations agreed this month to invoke the Rio Treaty, the 1947 pact that allows such joint actions as economic sanctions, naval blockades and military force.

Talks organized by the Norwegian government to secure a deal between Maduro’s government and the Guaidó-led opposition have broken down. Maduro’s officials now are negotiating with smaller opposition groups. In ­response, Guaidó’s officials have been pressuring European governments in particular to take a harder line against Maduro, to isolate a leader who claimed victory last year in a vote widely seen as fraudulent.

[Inside the secret plot to turn senior Venezuelan officials against Maduro]

Allegations of Venezuelan support for Colombian guerrillas date back two decades to Hugo Chávez, the founder of Venezuela’s socialist state. But opposition leaders say support for such groups, and their operations on Venezuelan territory, has ramped up under Maduro.

“It’s now very clear that the Colombian guerrillas are involved in illegal activities in Venezuela, and that [the Maduro government] is complicit in this,” opposition leader Leopoldo López said by telephone from the Spanish Embassy in Caracas, where he has sought sanctuary since an April 30 uprising attempt failed. “This contributes to opening the eyes of the international community that action needs to be taken.”

Figuera said he commissioned the report obtained by The Post late last year after a deadly ELN attack on a Venezuelan military outpost. That attack came after Venezuelan military commanders had taken the rare action of arresting four Colombian guerrillas on Venezuelan territory. They included an ELN commander: Felipe Ortega Bernal, also known as “La Garganta” — the Throat.

After Figuera handed Maduro the document, Figuera said, Maduro directed him to pass the material on to other senior officials, including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López.

Padrino López, Figuera said, appeared to share his concern that Colombian guerrillas were operating with impunity on Venezuelan territory.

“But he told me he wasn’t authorized to take action,” Figuera said.

A month later, Figuera said, a senior Colombian guerrilla leader asked him for a one-on-one meeting. He said he approached Maduro again.

“Maduro just told me, ‘I will handle it,’ ” Figuera said. “That was it. End of matter.”

Both the Venezuelan government and the ELN have denied coordinated logistical or tactical support. In May, the ELN, now Colombia’s largest active guerrilla group, denied it maintained troops in Venezuela and denied any allegiance to Maduro.

“These accusations are false,” Israel Ramírez, a senior ELN commander known by the nom de guerre Pablo Beltrán, said in a recorded message distributed to the media. “There are records of the dozens of members of the ELN who have been arrested on the Venezuelan border and immediately deported to Colombia.”

Jorge Rodríguez, Maduro’s minister of communication, has denied the Semana magazine report. He said the documents on which it was based were forged and part of a right-wing conspiracy aimed at taking down Maduro.

“They kill the truth in order to prepare the ground for an armed aggression against Venezuela,” Rodríguez said.

President Trump meets with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. (Evan Vucci/AP)

There’s little doubt that both sides of the “special relationship” had a rough day Tuesday. The only question really is who had it worse.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and President Trump were both in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly. Ultimately neither could escape his political problems.

At about 5.45 a.m. local time Tuesday, Johnson would have been awakened by the news that the British Supreme Court had declared his decision to suspend Parliament “unlawful, void and of no effect.""

The extraordinary decision meant British lawmakers would return to Parliament on Wednesday, throwing a spanner in the prime minister’s plans for leaving the European Union. “Parliament has not been prorogued,” said Brenda Hale, president of the U.K. Supreme Court, using a legal term to refer to the suspension.

In contrast, the U.S. president may have appeared to have a relatively calm morning. Appearing at a midday news conference with Johnson, Trump spent much of his time praising the embattled British prime minister.

“He’s a professional,” Trump said. “It’s just another day at the office.”

But Trump was dogged by difficult questions pertaining to a phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he allegedly brought up investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Asked at the news conference why aid was withheld from Ukraine, Trump gave a lengthy answer that pointed the blame at other nations.

“There was never any quid pro quo,” he said, shortly before ending the news conference.

The phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been the focus of speculation after it was revealed that a member of the U.S. intelligence community had filed an official complaint about Trump’s remarks.

As the day went on, the pressure built. At 2:10 p.m., Trump said he would release a transcript of the phone call.

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” Trump tweeted.

Whatever the contents of the transcript, its release is unlikely to placate critics, who have argued that the full whistleblower complaint needs to be released, too.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, announced at 2.30 p.m. that the whistleblower was seeking to speak directly to the committee and that he hoped to hear the “whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week.”

Multiple news outlets reported that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she planned to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump about 5 p.m. Tuesday.

“As soon as we have the facts, we’re ready. Now that we have the facts, we’re ready,” Pelosi said at a forum hosted by the Atlantic on Tuesday. “For later today.”

Pelosi had resisted calls to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. According to a Washington Post analysis, a section of Democrats who opposed impeachment have come out in favor of an inquiry over the past 48 hours, with more than 150 of 235 House Democrats in favor.

For both Trump and Johnson, the political scandals overshadowed attempts to set the agenda at the most important gathering of world leaders of the year. The United States and Britain have been trying to find their own common ground on major foreign issues, including the standoffs with China and Iran.

And for both the British and U.S. leaders, the day isn’t over. That’s especially true for Johnson, who is expected to get on a flight Tuesday evening to return for the reopening of Parliament on Wednesday."

“He thought he could do whatever he liked — just as he has always done, all his life,” Corbyn said. “He thinks he’s above us all.”

Joanna Cherry, a Scottish politician who helped launch the case in the Scottish courts, called the ruling “absolutely momentous.” Johnson’s position, she added, “is untenable. He should have the guts for once to do the decent thing and resign.”

In New York, where he was addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Johnson told reporters he “disagreed profoundly” with the court decision but added, “We respect the judiciary in our country.”

He vowed to press ahead — and again promised to deliver Brexit by the end of October.

A roiling, angry Parliament reconvenes after court rules Boris Johnson unlawfully suspended it

Johnson has maintained that lawmakers — and now the courts — are trying to block Brexit and undermine him in withdrawal negotiations with the European Union.

But in one of the highest-profile cases to come before Britain’s Supreme Court, 11 justices ruled unanimously that it was Johnson who was obstructing democracy.

The court said Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline “was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.”

The court noted that typically such breaks are measured in days, not weeks, and that this unusually long suspension came at a critical moment when Britain’s future was about to be determined.

The court judged that the suspension was “void and of no effect.” Parliament will reconvene Wednesday.

Legal scholars in Britain said the judgment was historic — on par with Marbury v. Madison, one of the U.S. Supreme Court’s most famous cases, which established the principle of judicial review.

The British Supreme Court rejected the government’s argument that suspending Parliament was a political and not a legal matter. The court was emphatic that the executive does not have unfettered power.

Another plaintiff in the British court proceedings, Gina Miller, a transparency activist, told Sky News: “This case is much, much bigger than Brexit. It is about the prime minister abusing his power and giving the queen illegal advice.”

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, a flamboyant character in the Brexit drama and vocal advocate for the rights of lawmakers, called the high court’s decision “unambiguous” and “unqualified.”

The U.K. Supreme Court is only 10 years old. But it just showed its power.

Bercow foreshadowed what is likely to be a freewheeling session for the chamber Wednesday, with lawmakers allowed to ask “urgent questions” of Johnson’s ministers and take part in “emergency debates.”

What happens next is anyone’s guess. Lawmakers spent Tuesday spinning possible scenarios. Some were pushing for a no-

confidence measure against Johnson. The prime minister already has lost his majority in Parliament. But it was unclear whether there were sufficient numbers to force him out.

Others thought that Johnson might try to suspend Parliament again or that new elections should be quickly staged.

Johnson said he would continue to seek an exit deal with E.U. leaders. He doubled down and promised that Britain would leave with or without a withdrawal agreement, even though Parliament has passed — and the queen signed — a bill forbidding Johnson to take Britain out of Europe without a deal, making another court case possible, too.

While Johnson’s options are limited, he has a few more cards to play. Even if his vision for Brexit is foiled and he is challenged in a snap election, the mop-headed prime minister remains a formidable campaigner and a popular if polarizing figure.

A YouGov poll published last week found that Johnson was still more popular than Labour’s Corbyn. Thirty-eight percent of the British public indicated a “favorable” view of Johnson, and 54 percent said their view was “unfavorable.” By comparison, the poll found that 21 percent had a positive view of Corbyn, and 70 percent had a negative view.

Still, the Supreme Court ruling is a deep wound. Johnson’s move to suspend Parliament was a bold and unprecedented one — and it backfired in spectacular fashion.

John Major, a former prime minister and fellow Conservative who submitted testimony against Johnson, said he hopes the ruling “will deter any future prime minister from attempting to shut down Parliament, with the effect of stifling proper scrutiny and debate, when its sitting is so plainly in the national interest.”

Major added, “No prime minister must ever treat the monarch or Parliament in this way again.”

PM vs. PM: John Major argues against Boris Johnson in U.K. Supreme Court case

Joelle Grogan, a senior lecturer in law at Middlesex University, said she watched the judgment in a room full of academics, who were stunned by the decision. “It’s the rewriting of an unwritten constitution,” she said.

“The truth of Brexit is that it’s exposing questions to the courts that they’ve never been exposed to before,” Grogan said. “We’re now asking them basic questions: What is Parliament? What is government? What is the separation between the two . . . and when there is a clash of law and politics, who gets to make the big decisions?”

Grogan said that one remarkable aspect of this case was its speed. Cases often take years to weave through the lower courts before they arrive at the highest court in the land, she said.

In this instance, Johnson announced at the end of August that he planned to shutter Parliament. Less than a month later, the out-of-session Supreme Court was called in to consider combined legal challenges on appeal. Tuesday’s ruling followed three days of hearings last week.

Within only one month, Boris Johnson lost control — and a historic Supreme Court battle

In New York on Tuesday, Johnson’s schedule included a bilateral meeting with President Trump, who is also facing a fresh political scandal this week.

Speaking with reporters, the U.S. president was asked about his reaction to the British court decision.

“I had no reaction,” Trump said. “I just asked Boris, and, you know, to him it’s another day in the office.”

Johnson followed that with: “Tomorrow is another day in Parliament.”

The ‘rebel alliance’ teamed up to thwart Boris Johnson’s plans. Can it stay united to steer Brexit?

He defied Boris Johnson. Now the prime minister’s party is gunning for his seat, with Brexit on the line.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Authorities in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands reported a downed bridge, limited power outages, flooding and landslides as Tropical Storm Karen swirled away from the northeast Caribbean on Wednesday.

Schools remained closed in Puerto Rico, although government offices reopened. Meanwhile, everything reopened in the U.S. Virgin Islands except for offices and schools in St. John.

Crews temporarily closed some coastal roads in southeastern Puerto Rico that flooded after Karen hit the island on Tuesday and knocked out power to 29,000 customers. An island-wide outage was reported in neighboring St. Thomas Tuesday morning, followed by smaller outages later that afternoon.

A community in the mountain town of Utuado was isolated Wednesday after a bridge that had been damaged during Hurricane Maria two years ago collapsed during the rains of Tropical Storm Karen. Mayor Ernesto Irizarry told reporters that he has been seeking $1 million to repair the bridge.

Intermittent rains continued Friday even as Karen pulled away.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that late Wednesday, the storm was centered about 445 miles (715 kilometers) north-northeast of San Juan and it was moving north-northeast at 15 mph (24 kph). The storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph).

Forecasters said the storm is projected to make a clockwise loop over the Atlantic over the weekend, which would leave it heading generally toward the U.S. East Coast.

Meanwhile, Jerry became a post-tropical cyclone and was nearing Bermuda on Wednesday.

Further to the east, Lorenzo became the fifth Atlantic hurricane of the season and was projected to become a major hurricane by the end of the week, although it is not expected to affect the Caribbean. It was centered about 915 miles (1,470 kilometers) west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph). It was heading west-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).

Russia, which holds the council presidency this month, organized the meeting on cooperation between the U.N. and three Eurasian organizations in countering terrorism — the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Collective Security Treaty Organization, and Commonwealth of Independent States.

The United States and its Western allies echoed the secretary-general, stressing the importance of respecting human rights in counter-terrorism operations.

“Efforts to counter terrorism that do not respect human rights ultimately breed resentment and violent extremism,” U.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen said. “When member states or regional organizations conflate terrorism with non-violent political dissent, they do a disservice not only to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, but to our global effort to defeat terrorism.”

He said the world is witnessing this “dangerous approach” in Syria, where the government and its Russian allies “justify as legitimate counter-terrorist operations airstrikes on civilians, schools, ambulances and hospitals that have killed over a thousand people since April and wounded over 2,000.”

The United States is also “deeply concerned” by the plight of more than one million ethnic minority Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province who have been arbitrarily detained “under the guise of counter-terrorism.”

“China, like all nations, has every right to respond to actual terrorist threats, but counter-terrorism cannot be used as an excuse to repress the peaceful religious practices of Chinese Muslims and an entire minority group,” the Uighurs, Cohen said.

Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that the “terrorist threat” coming from Syria and Iraq is very rapidly spreading through Africa, including Libya, “and central, southern and southeast Asia are also becoming areas where savage acts of terrorism are perpetrated.”

Alluding to Western criticism, he said, “the double-standards used by some countries make it more difficult to react to the challenges today, including the terrorist challenges.”

“It is unacceptable — I underscore that — using terrorist entities for political purposes,” Lavrov said. “There can be no justification for this.”

Vladimir Norov, secretary-general of the eight-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization, said the fight against terrorism and related threats is one of its main activities and called Wednesday’s meeting “extremely timely” because of increasing instability in the world due to the terrorist threat and its emerging link to transnational crime.

He said fighters that supported the Islamic State extremist group in Syria and Iraq “are striving to create new strongholds, including in the Eurasian space.” And he warned that “the threat of their access to radioactive and toxic substances is growing, and their possible use of new types of financing and weapons.”

The organization — which includes Russia, China, India and Pakistan — has half the world’s population and is regarded as the primary security pillar in the region, but Norov stressed that “it’s not a military organization aimed at other states.”

Valery Semerikov, secretary-general of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, told the council “the world is under threat of global terrorism” and joint work to combat it is needed today.

He said the organization — a six-nation military alliance of Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Belarus — made an open appeal to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in May “on increasing trust and developing cooperation” in countering global threats and challenges.

“I would like to address the foreign ministers of NATO and ask them to consider and react to the open appeal lodged by the ministers of foreign affairs of the CSTO,” Semerikov said.

JAKARTA, Indonesia — A strong earthquake in eastern Indonesia cracked a bridge and a university building Thursday, while aftershocks sent people streaming outdoors as further damage was being assessed.

The magnitude 6.5 quake was centered 37 kilometers (23 miles) northeast of Ambon, the capital of Maluku province, at a depth of 29 kilometers (18 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said.

Rahmat Triyono, the head of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami center, said the inland earthquake did not have the potential to cause a tsunami, but witnesses told television stations that people along coastal areas ran to higher ground in fear one might occur.

Television footage showed hundreds of people gathered outdoors as aftershocks rocked the Maluku island chain where the quake was mostly strongly felt.

“The temblor was so strong, causing us poured into the streets,” said Musa, an Ambon resident who uses a single name. He said there were no damages or injuries in his neighborhood, but he said people on social media chatted about damage elsewhere in the city.

The national disaster mitigation agency said authorities are still gathering information about damage and injuries at several affected areas. It said the quake had caused cracks in a main bridge in Ambon, and pictures released by the agency showed minor damage at Pattimura University in the city.

Indonesia, home to more than 260 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location along the “Ring of Fire,” the string of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean.

A powerful Indian Ocean quake and tsunami in 2004 killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesia.

Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa is appealing for patience for his efforts to pull his country out of an economic collapse, and called on the U.S. and Europe to lift “illegal sanctions” that he blamed for hindering recovery.

Mnangagwa made no mention during an address to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday of alleged political repression under his rule, which has diminishes hopes that Zimbabwe might be on the brink of change following the 2017 ouster of longtime leader Robert Mugabe, who died in Singapore earlier this month.

More than 50 government critics and activists have been abducted in Zimbabwe this year, at times tortured and warned by suspected state security agents to back off from anti-government actions.

Critics have accused Mnangagwe of resorting to strong-armed tactics as opposition to his government grows amid crippling inflation, debilitating water shortages and chronic power cuts.

Libya’s Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj has ruled out peace talks with the leader of his country’s rival government, describing him as a “war criminal.”

Sarraj used much of his time before the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday to deride Khalifa Hifter and his supporters as “coup plotters” and blame them for Libya’s continued instability.

Sarraj said Hifter was “not a partner for peace.”

Libya was thrown into chaos during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. The rebellion led to the overthrow of longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi, and Libya has been split between two governments virtually ever since, each backed by rival Arab states.

The lack of security has made Libya’s shores a transit point for migrants seeking refuge in Europe. Libya has been criticized for its treatment of those migrants.

Sarraj hit back on that, saying Libya is a victim of migration, not the cause of migration.

Guatemala’s president isn’t letting up on lambasting a U.N. anti-corruption commission, even though it disbanded this month after he refused to extend its mandate.

Jimmy Morales devoted nearly half his U.N. General Assembly speech Wednesday to the now-gone commission. It was known as CICIG for its initials in Spanish.

Morales said it infringed on Guatemala’s sovereignty and jeopardized “social peace.” He called for an investigation into it and a detailed report on its spending.

A message requesting comment was sent to a U.N. spokesman.

Over 12 years, the commission helped prosecute hundreds of people. Among them were Morales’ son and brother, who were exonerated by a court.

The commission also tried to bring a campaign-finance-related case against Morales, who denied wrongdoing. He was protected from prosecution as a sitting president.

President Donald Trump says he placed “no pressure” on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.

Trump commented Wednesday during a meeting in New York with Zelenskiy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting of world leaders.

Asked about their July telephone call, Zelenskiy said it was a “good phone call” and “normal” and that he and Trump discussed “many things.”

Zelenskiy adds: “Nobody pushed me.”

A rough transcript summarizing the call that the White House released Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy to work with the U.S. attorney general and Trump’s personal attorney to investigate Biden, a former U.S. vice president.

The call is the subject of a whistleblower complaint against Trump and the basis for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to open an impeachment inquiry.

Colombia’s president is blasting Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as a dictator who offers a safe haven for terrorist groups.

In his speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, Ivan Duque said he has proof Maduro is harboring criminals plotting against Colombia. He vowed to deliver a 128-page dossier to U.N. leaders outlining the evidence.

Duque said the document includes information on 207 locations inside Venezuela that are controlled by ELN guerrillas. He described the neighboring Andean nation as “fertile land” for the ELN to expand.

Maduro has denied supporting criminal organizations and accuses Duque of similarly allowing illegal armed groups to flourish.

A group of Western Hemisphere nations agreed to invoke the 1947 Rio Treaty providing a legal framework for more sanctions against Maduro on Monday.

The World Health Organization chief says the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is “on the retreat,” but he warns that any attack by the many armed groups in eastern Congo could affect health workers’ hard-won gains.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at the U.N. headquarters Wednesday that it’s not a good idea to predict an end to the outbreak that has killed nearly 2,000 people since August of last year.

He also refused to elaborate on the U.N. agency’s unusual weekend statement raising questions about whether neighboring Tanzania had covered up possible Ebola cases. He notes that “we have to strengthen our preparedness in neighboring countries.”

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar calls this the most complex Ebola outbreak in history and says stopping it is one of the top priorities for President Donald Trump.

President Donald Trump has announced the “first stage of a phenomenal new trade agreement” with Japan.

It’s not immediately clear from Trump’s comments on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly what that “first stage” includes.

But Washington and Japan — which is the world’s third largest economy — have been in long, sometimes contentious negotiations on a trade deal.

There’s reportedly been considerable behind-the-scenes wrangling because of Japan’s concern about the possibility of future U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto exports.

Trump says Japan will open new markets to approximately $7 billion in U.S. agriculture products, including beef, pork, wheat, cheese, corn, wine and more.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is accusing the United States of “merciless economic terrorism” and “international piracy.”

Tensions are running particularly high between Iran and the United States since President Donald Trump’s decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear agreement with world powers. Trump has since re-imposed and expanded sanctions on Iran, targeting its oil exports and crippling its economy.

Rouhani told the United Nations General Assembly gathering Wednesday that Iran would not negotiate on the nuclear issue as long as sanctions remain in place.

He said Iran has “resisted the most merciless economic terrorism.”

Ministers from the five powers that support the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and the Iranian government say they are striving to preserve it — and have underlined the importance of all sides implementing the deal.

The ministers said the agreement remains a key element “of global nuclear non-proliferation.”

European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini read the brief statement on behalf of the ministers from Russia, China, Britain France, Germany and Iran after they held a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning.

Asked whether the agreement can be preserved, Mogherini said, “I won’t hide it that it’s increasingly difficult to do that, and we discussed today that.”

Mogherini said she believes Iran’s actions to break the deal’s nuclear-related limits “are reversible.” Iran is seeking to pressure Europe to offer it a way to sell its crude oil despite U.S. sanctions.

He added in his speech before the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that more than 250,000 refugees have returned to Syria from Lebanon “and there has been no information about anyone being persecuted or mistreated.”

He says Lebanon will continue to encourage the “voluntary” return of refugees in coordination with the Syrian government.

Saleh told the United Nations General Assembly gathering Wednesday: “Iraq will not be a launching pad for aggression against any of our neighboring countries.”

He called the attacks in Saudi Arabia a dangerous development.

Saleh bemoaned that Iraq has long been unstable but struck a positive note, saying his country was emerging from years of conflict and looking toward economic development.

His speech Wednesday came less than day after a formal U.S. House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump was launched, a development that was sparked partly by a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy.

At issue is whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from Ukraine to undermine Democratic foe Joe Biden and help his own re-election.

The man at the center of America’s latest political storm kicks off the second day of speeches Wednesday at this year’s gathering of world leaders.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s first-ever address before the world body comes a mere few hours after a formal U.S. House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump was launched — a development that was sparked partly by a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy.

At issue is whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from Ukraine to undermine Democratic foe Joe Biden and help his own re-election.

In the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine, prompting speculation that he was holding up the money as leverage for information on the Bidens.

Trump has denied that charge but acknowledged he blocked the funds.

In another highly anticipated speech, Ukraine’s freshly minted president will address the group for the first time as a fast-escalating scandal involving U.S. President Donald Trump swirls around him.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speech comes just a day after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, focused partly on whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from Ukraine to undermine Democratic foe Joe Biden and help his own re-election.

Many of the world’s leaders have used their speeches so far to defend the multilateralism embodied by the United Nations.

Boris Johnson has refused to moderate his language during a heated debate in the Commons, despite a barrage of criticism from opposition benches.

Labour's Paula Sherriff referred to Jo Cox, the MP murdered in 2016, as she pleaded with him to refrain from using ""dangerous"" words like ""surrender"".

He described her intervention as ""humbug"" and repeated the word again.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described scenes in Parliament as an ""absolute bear pit"".

Mr Johnson was repeatedly challenged over his use of the word ""surrender"" to describe legislation passed earlier this month which aims to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.

Ms Sherriff, the Labour MP for Dewsbury, told the Commons the prime minister had ""continually used pejorative language to describe an Act of Parliament passed by this House"".

Pointing to a plaque in the chamber, commemorating Mrs Cox, who was murdered by a right-wing extremist, she said: ""We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like, and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day.""

""They often quote his words 'Surrender Act', 'betrayal', 'traitor' and I for one am sick of it.

""We must moderate our language, and it has to come from the prime minister first.""

In response, Mr Johnson said: ""I have to say, Mr Speaker, I've never heard such humbug in all my life.""

'A threat against my child'

Tracy Brabin, who was elected as MP for Batley and Spen after Ms Cox was murdered, also urged the prime minister to moderate his language ""so that we will all feel secure when we're going about our jobs"".

Mr Johnson replied that ""the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done"".

Mrs Cox's husband, Brendan, later tweeted he felt ""sick at Jo's name being used in this way"".

The best way to honour her is to ""stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination"", he tweeted.

Skip Twitter post by @MrBrendanCox Feel a bit sick at Jo’s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common. — Brendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) September 25, 2019 Report

Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said the prime minister was an ""utter disgrace"" for his response to the questions on his language.

She told MPs: ""I today have reported to the police a threat against my child. That has been dismissed as 'humbug'.

""This is a disgraceful state of affairs and we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better.""

Image copyright HoC Image caption Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told MPs a threat had been made against her child

Leader of the Independent Group for Change, Anna Soubry, said it ""takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears"" but she said she is ""not alone tonight"".

""There are others I believe who have left the estate, such has been the distress,"" she told MPs.

""In this, the most peculiar and extraordinary of political times, the language that is used is incredibly important.

""We have evidence, whatever side of the debate you are on, when you use word like 'surrender', 'capitulation', and others use the word 'traitor' and 'treason', there is a direct consequence.

""It means my mother receives a threat to her safety. It means my partner receives a death threat.""

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the Speaker to unite the party leaders ""to issue a joint declaration opposing any form of abusive language or threats and to put this message out to our entire community that we have to treat each other with respect"".

Speaker John Bercow said he was ""very open to convening a meeting of senior colleagues for the purpose of a House-wide public statement"".

Conservative MP Stephen Crabb told BBC Newsnight that he was ""shocked by the way [the PM] responded to the remarks about Jo Cox"".

He said Mr Johnson had ""strong support among Conservative MPs... but he also has a duty as prime minister to try to bring unity to our country and reduce the level of poison in our politics"".

Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said the prime minister was ""aware and sympathetic"" to the threats MPs have received.

""But at a time of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us,"" she tweeted."

The introduction of minimum pricing for alcohol in Scotland appears to have cut drinking, a study suggests.

Since May 2018, the price of alcohol has had to be at least 50p per unit.

The study published in the British Medical Journal looked at how much alcohol was bought in shops before and after the move up to the end of 2018.

It found the amount purchased per person per week fell by 1.2 units - the equivalent of just over half a pint of beer or a measure of spirits.

Scotland was the first country in the world to introduce a minimum price based on the strength of alcoholic drinks. Research findings have led to calls for the policy to be adopted across the UK.

Wales is looking to introduce minimum pricing in 2020, but neither England nor Northern Ireland currently have plans to set a limit.

Researchers, led by a team at Newcastle University, looked at how much alcohol people were buying in shops and supermarkets, but not in pubs.

They analysed the purchasing habits of 60,000 English and Scottish households between 2015 and 2018. Just over 5,000 of them were in Scotland.

The English households were used as a control group to measure what would have happened if there had not been a minimum price in Scotland.

While households in England increased their consumption slightly, Scottish purchasing fell.

The study said overall it represented a fall of 7.6%, or 1.2 units, a week per adult on what would have been expected.

The team said that was about twice the impact predicted ahead of the move.

Reductions were most noticeable for beer, spirits, and cider, including own-brand spirits and high-strength white ciders, and were biggest among the heaviest drinkers.

But the team acknowledged there needed to be longer-term follow up to see if the drop was sustained, as there was some evidence that in the later months of 2018 consumption had begun to rise again.

Lead researcher Prof Peter Anderson said: ""You would expect some levelling off from the initial impact, but I think the findings are enough to suggest minimum pricing is effective and should be adopted across the UK.""

Eric Carlin from the Royal College of Physicians agreed the evidence was compelling, but he said risky alcohol consumption was a ""complex"" public health issue.

""No single policy lever should be seen as a panacea,"" he added.

Scottish public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said the findings were ""very encouraging""."

A social media influencer in China has been exposed for living a ""double life"", after her landlord exposed her filthy living conditions, which contrasted with the glamorous image she presented online.

Footage went viral showing the apartment of Lisa Li - a blogger with 1.1 million followers - littered with rubbish, mouldy food, and dog excrement.

Since the footage was published, Ms Li has apologised.

Why was Ms Li famous?

Lisa Li is known in China as a ""wang hong"", or ""online celebrity"", on the popular Sina Weibo microblog.

Her account, like that of many young Chinese influencers, is a glossy catalogue of travel adventures, parties and fine-dining experiences.

But since her landlord gave media a tour of her apartment in the northern city of Xi'an, she has become famous for different reasons.

Image copyright The Paper Image caption Weibo users were stunned by the state Ms Li's apartment was left in

What did her landlord do?

After Lisa Li seemingly ignored a number of phone calls, millions of users watched her landlord, named by media as Ms Chen, give a guided tour of her filthy apartment.

Ms Chen told Pear Video that even professional cleaners had refused to clean the place, adding that her tenant owed thousands of yuan in unpaid utility bills.

Ms Chen said that she had no choice but to contact the police about the damage to her property and the unpaid utilities.

Image copyright Pear Video Image caption Footage went viral showing Ms Li's floors covered in dog excrement

But she particularly got social media attention for showing her tenant's Weibo page to the outlet, saying: ""This is an online influencer with one million followers.""

She told Pear Video in a passionate interview the ""beautiful woman"" being presented online contrasted with the ""disgusting"" woman who left her apartment in a mess.

How did Ms Li react?

Image copyright Pear Video Image caption Ms Li (L) met with her landlord (R) to apologise and resolve the issue

After millions of people saw the footage inside Ms Li's apartment, she suddenly resurfaced.

And rather than issuing a statement on social media, Ms Li met with her landlord to apologise in person.

""Complete responsibility lies with me on this incident,"" she told Ms Chen. They were filmed shaking hands.

She explained her absence to popular news website The Paper as being the result of a tight schedule, saying that she went into hospital last week, and then went on a business trip.

She said that she had recently received a large number of messages on mobile WeChat, and had seemingly missed her landlord's.

""I will clean now… I will even clean overnight,"" she told The Paper.

How have Ms Li's fans reacted?

Image copyright Pear Video Image caption Ms Li returned to clean her apartment

Footage of Ms Li sweeping dog poo into a dustpan has shocked her fans, and led to a large amount of mockery online.

More than 60,000 users have commented on her page, many saying they were unfollowing her and calling her ""fake"".

Many have also questioned her sincerity in her interviews with mainstream media. Users noted she has changed her social media handle and removed a number of earlier posts.

Image copyright The Paper Image caption Ms Li told The Paper she hadn't seen messages from her landlord

Is this the first time this type of thing has happened?

China is on a huge drive to push for celebrities to be ""socially responsible"".

It heavily frowns on influencers not setting a good example to young followers, and has a track record of making examples of such people, arguing that stars need to be good role models and preserve a healthy online culture.

In July, a Chinese vlogger became the subject of widespread mockery, after a technical glitch during a live-stream revealed her to be a middle-aged woman, and not the young woman she had presented herself to be.

Some ""badly behaved"" influencers have even received short jail terms. In October 2018, Yang Kaili, a live-streaming celebrity with tens of millions of followers, was detained for five days for ""insulting"" the country's national anthem.

The live-streaming platform she used, Huya, took down her video and banned her channel, saying: ""Live-streaming platforms are not above the law - the law and moral standards similarly apply there.""

A migraine drug that has been described as ""life changing"" by some patients will not be made available on the NHS outside of Scotland.

Erenumab - also known by the name Aimovig - is one of the first bespoke migraine drugs in decades and has been described by doctors as a ""huge deal"".

But the body that approves new drugs said there were doubts whether it was good enough or worth the money.

Charities said it seemed to be a ""very bad day"" for migraine suffers.

Current drugs to prevent migraine are former epilepsy or heart failure medicines or the anti-wrinkle drug Botox.

However, some patients have migraines that do not respond to any available treatments.

What makes Erenumab different is it is specifically designed for preventing migraine.

It uses antibodies to alter the activity of chemicals in the brain that are involved in both pain and sensitivity to sound and light that comes with migraine.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption This is what happens when you have a migraine

Trials showed erenumab more than halved the number of migraines each month for around a third of hard-to-treat patients.

The Scottish Medicines Consortium approved the drug for use in patients with chronic migraine when other treatments had failed.

But the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - which evaluates drugs for England, but Wales and Northern Ireland tend to follow suit - has rejected the drug.

Migraine facts

One in seven people around the world live with the regular agony of migraine

Migraine is up to three times more common in women than men

The Migraine Trust estimates there are more than 190,000 migraine attacks every day in the UK

People with headaches for fewer than 15 days a month have episodic migraine

If it is on more than 15 days it is classed as chronic migraine

NICE's final decision, published on its website, said there was ""substantial uncertainty in the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of erenumab"".

The price the drug company Novartis is charging the NHS is confidential, but the company insists the cost ""reflects the clinical value"" erenumab brings to patients.

The British Association for the Study of Headache Council said it was difficult to understand why the treatment was approved in Scotland, but not the rest of the UK.

Its chairman, Dr Mark Weatherall, said: ""This drug is not a panacea, but it is an important advance in the scientific treatment of migraine, which effects huge improvements in the lives of many of those who take it.

""It is completely unacceptable that patients in England and Wales who suffer with such a debilitating neurological disorder should be denied access to effective treatment.""

Gus Baldwin, the chief executive of The Migraine Trust, said: ""This still feels like a very bad day for chronic migraine patients.""

More than a quarter of secondary school pupils in England and Wales have received private tuition, according to research published by the Sutton Trust.

The highest levels are in London - with 41% of secondary pupils getting extra lessons outside of school, it says.

The social-mobility charity is calling for financial support for disadvantaged families to have access to tutoring.

""With costs of at least £25 per session, many parents can't afford it,"" said charity founder Sir Peter Lampl.

The annual report from the Sutton Trust tracks the prevalence of parents paying for tuition.

Wealth gap

Such extra lessons have been seen as a hidden factor in exam results - but because of the cost, the charity warns this gives richer families an unfair advantage.

Based on evidence from the National Foundation for Educational Research and a survey of almost 3,000 families, the report suggests 27% of 11 to 16-year-olds have had some private tuition while at secondary school.

This is higher than the 18% who received tutoring in 2005 but has fallen back on a couple of years ago, when 30% had paid for extra lessons, it says.

But the use of tutors is skewed towards the affluent, with 34% of better-off families having used tutors compared with 20% of less well-off families.

Paying for extra tuition is twice as common in England than Wales - 28% to 14% - and a separate figure for London suggests much higher levels of 41%.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Extra help with GCSEs is the most common reason families pay for private tuition, the research suggests

The most common reasons given for hiring tutors were helping with a specific GCSE exam and ""schoolwork in general"".

The research suggests almost a quarter of classroom teachers in secondary school have worked as private tutors in the past two years, with most of these providing lessons after being asked by parents.

Tuition vouchers

The Sutton Trust says there is evidence such individual tutoring can make a positive difference.

But it says there needs to be a way of making it available to the disadvantaged, such as providing means-tested vouchers.

Trust founder and chairman Sir Peter Lampl said such a scheme would ""enable lower-income families to provide tuition for their children"" in an environment in which ""private tuition is widespread"".

Mary Bousted, joint leader of the National Education Union, said such subsidies for tuition could seem appealing but the money would be better spent increasing budgets for underfunded schools or pupil premium funding to support disadvantaged pupils.

Labour's annual conference has backed calls to move private schools into the state sector, but a party spokesman said this would not affect private tutoring outside school."

Joanna Sim is a self-confessed member of the Peloton cult. She gets up at 05:00 for the company's classes. She writes about them on her blog for working parents.

She doesn't just like Peloton, she says, she loves it.

""It's almost borderline addiction at this point,"" she says. Now she's planning to invest.

The company, which sells tech-enhanced exercise equipment tied to streaming fitness classes, will debut its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday, at a starting price of $29 apiece.

The offering will raise about $1.16bn, in a deal that values the firm at more than $8bn (£6.5bn).

It's a hefty number in a notoriously fickle industry.

Peloton acolytes such as Joanna say the company has matched exercise to the age of social media, combining the convenience of an at-home workout with the interaction and adrenaline rush of live classes.

The company, which was founded in 2012, has more than 500,000 subscribers. It went live in the UK and Canada in 2018 and in Germany in May. It has started branching out to new areas, offering classes in yoga and strength-training.

High-profile users include Kate Hudson, David Beckham, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt and more.

Participation is expensive. Peloton's stationary bikes cost more than $2,200 and its treadmills, which it started selling last year, are almost double that. Unlimited access to the streaming classes runs to another $39 a month.

Despite the price tag, Joanna says she ""took the plunge"" last year, cancelling her gym membership and buying a bike in the hope it would make it easier to fit in more workouts.

The mother of two, who lives in California and works full-time as a design strategist at software company Intuit, has not been disappointed.

She says the flexibility of the company's programmes, and the ""tribe"" of fellow riders she interacts with during a regular 05:00 class, have kept her coming back for more, and more.

Her enthusiasm extends to the firm's financial prospects.

""They're going to IPO soon and I'm... all over it,"" she says.

Money spinner

Peloton made $915m in revenue in its most recent financial year, more than double the year before, which was double the year before that.

But growth has come with costs.

Image copyright Peloton Image caption Peloton's tech-enhanced equipment offers live fitness classes at home

Peloton remains unprofitable, losing about $200m last year, as its marketing expense skyrocketed.

In the run-up to its flotation, music publishers hit the company with a $300m copyright lawsuit, accusing the firm of using music for its classes without permission.

And sceptics are asking if the firm, which today relies on big-ticket purchases of equipment, has staying power, given the appearance of lower-cost competitors and fast changing fitness fads.

""It's very difficult to double every year,"" says Rett Wallace, chief executive of research firm Triton. ""Right now, it looks like we're still very much in a growth phase on the hardware but we don't know how long that will last.""

'Fitness is difficult'

Other fitness firms testing the public markets in recent years haven't fared particularly well.

The pricey cycling studio chain SoulCycle, which once claimed cachet similar to Peloton, filed flotation papers in 2015.

But the company, a subsidiary of property giant Related Co, dropped those plans last year, citing ""market conditions"". This summer, the mood soured farther, when owner Steve Ross's fundraiser for President Donald Trump triggered a customer boycott.

YogaWorks debuted on the Nasdaq in 2017, after a growth sprint fuelled by private equity backer Great Hill Partners turned it into one of the largest yoga chains in the US.

Less than two years later, the firm de-listed its shares, amid mounting losses and a warning from the exchange that the stock's price no longer met the minimum threshold.

And it's not just fitness chains focused on live classes that have struggled.

Shares in FitBit, which makes wearable fitness trackers, approached $50 in the summer of 2015, when the rapidly growing firm went public. But sales soon slumped and today, the shares trade at about $4.

""Hardware is difficult. Fitness is difficult,"" says Mr Wallace. ""If you rely on the sale of hardware, even Apple shows us that if you're not reinventing your hardware all the time, your life can become difficult.""

""Peloton seems to have established a brand for itself and has a very loyal user base,"" he adds. ""We'll see if that sticks.""

Joanna says she's heard the doubts but her experience convinced her that Peloton has a long ride ahead of it.

""Given the amount of content that they're pumping out and the leadership that they have... I have full confidence,"" she says."

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will officially name the UK's new polar research ship after Sir David Attenborough on Thursday.

The famous broadcaster and naturalist will be on hand to witness the ceremony, which is taking place at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead.

In time-honoured tradition, a bottle of champagne will be smashed against the vessel's hull.

Some 200 children dressed as penguins will be among the large ticketed crowd.

The £200m vessel was commissioned to replace the James Clark Ross and the Shackleton, which between them gave almost 50 years' service in support of UK polar science.

The RRS Sir David Attenborough will now carry the union flag into the Arctic and the Antarctic.

This is the vessel an online poll had cheekily suggested be called ""Boaty McBoatface"" before ministers stepped in to end the joke.

That humorous moniker was given instead to the long-range robotic yellow submarines that will in future operate from the Attenborough.

The naming ceremony will be a moment for great celebration and pride in Birkenhead.

Yard workers, their families, VIPs and local residents will throng the quayside to see the royals inaugurate the vessel.

The 130m-long, 15,000-tonne ""floating science lab"" represents the largest commercial ship built in Britain in three decades.

Its initial keel block was laid in October 2016, with the 10,000-tonne completed hull section entering the River Mersey in July last year. Final fixtures and fittings are almost in and it is expected commissioning trials will get under way in the coming weeks.

Its entry into service comes not a moment too soon.

Wednesday witnessed the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) special report on Earth's oceans and frozen regions.

This document paints a grim picture of rapid and accelerating losses from the ice sheets of both the far north and the far south.

It will be the job of the RRS Sir David Attenborough to go document the changes that are occurring and to help scientists work out how fast the melting will impinge on lower latitudes.

Already sea levels are rising globally by about 5mm per year (taken over the past five years), with ice losses at the poles now considered to be the major driver of this trend.

By the year 2100, according to some scenarios, the oceans could be 1.1m higher than they are now, which would pose a major challenge to the viability of many coastal settlements worldwide.

Why does this ship matter?

The British Antarctic Survey, which has managed the UK's polar fleet, needs a modern platform from which to conduct world-leading research.

Image caption There 750km of power and data cabling running through the ship

The chartered RRS Ernest Shackleton has already been returned to its owner; the RSS James Clark Ross will be let go very shortly, too.

It is the view of the funding agency, the Natural Environment Research Council, that the more advanced Attenborough can fulfil the tasks of both the earlier vessels - in research and in logistics. So, not only can its gear and labs do cutting-edge science, but it can carry numerous freight containers to resupply bases and expeditions in the field.

How special is the ship?

It is an icebreaker. There are different classes for this type of vessel but the specification says the Attenborough should be able to plough through 1m-thick sea ice at three knots (3.5mph/5.5km/h).

This will soon be tested when the ship is taken out on trials in the Arctic.

The Attenborough has a helipad (helicopters are essential), cranes and onboard labs, and it has the ability to deploy subs and other ocean survey and sampling equipment.

Image copyright BAS Image caption Silent running: The ship is designed to run and make minimal noise

One of its key features is an enclosed ""moon pool"". This is essentially a huge hole running right through the middle of the hull. It will allow instruments to be lowered into - and recovered from - the sea when weather or dense sea-ice conditions would normally make such work very difficult.

The ship design, put together by Rolls-Royce, also enables near-silent running when required, meaning scientists can study sea creatures without disturbing them.

What happened to the ""Boaty"" name?

Boaty McBoatface lives on in the form of yellow submarines. The National Oceanography Centre in Southampton has several of these long-range autonomous underwater vehicles.

When one of these is out on patrol, it carries the Boaty moniker.

The intention is that these Boaty-class subs will frequently operate from the Attenborough. They will be asked to go into places the ship itself cannot reach, such as under the colossal floating ice shelves that surround Antarctica.

Prison inmates have been resorting to throwing human waste out of their cell windows because of a lack of toilets, a report has found.

The Independent Monitoring Board said it was ""appalled at the lack of in-cell sanitation"" at Surrey's HMP Coldingley.

It said prisoners were forced to use buckets in their cells at night and some would ""inevitably... dispose of human waste via cell windows"".

The Ministry of Justice has pledged to ""address this long-standing issue"".

More than 350 men live in cells without lavatories or sinks at the Category C prison near Bisley, the report said.

'Impossible to keep clean'

HMP Coldingley was one of six institutions named as a ""reform prison"" in 2016, with governors granted extra powers in what the government called the ""biggest shake-up of the prisons system since the Victorian era"".

It came alongside a commitment to spend £1.3bn to ""replace decrepit, ageing prisons with modern establishments"".

Heather Cook, chair of the monitoring board at Coldingley, said the prison's biggest problem continued to be the ""poor state"" of four wings built in 1969, which were ""almost impossible to keep clean"".

The board's report said the ""night sanitation arrangement"" at the jail was ""degrading and totally unsatisfactory"".

At night, inmates had to press a buzzer and join a queue to be let out of their cell to use communal toilets.

The report said queues could be long and a prisoner's ""only other option is to use a pot in his cell and then to 'slop out' in the morning"".

Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the problem stemmed from prisoners being locked in their cells during the day and ""sleeping through their sentences"", meaning they were more likely to be awake at night, needing the toilet.

Former Justice Secretary David Gauke said in February the government had ""made funding available for major structural work which will address this long-standing issue"".

The Independent Monitoring Board said it ""remains to be seen when this essential work will be undertaken""."

Men who have fertility treatment have a higher risk of prostate cancer in later life, a study has suggested.

The research - in the British Medical Journal - looked at 1.2 million pregnancies in Sweden over 20 years.

Men who had ICSI - a treatment specifically for male infertility - had an increased prostate cancer risk.

But Prostate Cancer UK said researchers must look at a much broader age range before concluding men who have fertility treatment are at higher risk.

Researchers from Lund University in Sweden used data from national birth and cancer registers.

They looked at more than a million births between 1994 and 2014, and at cancer cases.

Most babies - 97% - were conceived naturally, and 20,618 (1.7%) were conceived using IVF, although the data does not show if fertility issues lay with the man or the woman.

Some 14,882 (1.3%) births resulted from ICSI, where a single, good-quality sperm is selected and injected directly into an egg.

ICSI was first used in Sweden in 1992, with every case recorded by the register.

'Offer the test'

Among the natural conception group, 3,244 (0.28%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 77 (0.37%) in the IVF group and 63 (0.42%) among those who had ICSI.

Men in the ICSI group also had a higher risk of developing early onset prostate cancer, before the age of 55.

Prof Yvonne Lundberg Giwercman, who led the study, told the BBC: ""The prostate cancer numbers are quite small, but these men are very young.

""They are a small, high-risk group, and we should be following them more closely.""

She said she hoped there would be further studies to investigate why the link existed.

Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: ""It has been proposed that male infertility might serve as a ""canary in the coal mine"" for men's health, which both men and their doctors should be better attuned to.""

He added: ""It is important to be clear that this is not because the techniques of assisted reproduction go on to cause prostate cancer, but probably because the two have a common cause in some way.

""Perhaps all men who are diagnosed with a fertility problem in their 20s and 30s should be given a leaflet explaining what this might mean for them in their 50s and 60s, so that they can be aware of possible future problems, and be encouraged to visit their GP a bit quicker than they often do.""

'Little evidence'

But Simon Grieveson, from Prostate Cancer UK, said it was important not to ""leap to any conclusions"" on the basis of this study.

""Prostate cancer is more common in men over the age of 50. The men involved in this study were younger on average, and therefore already have a very low risk of prostate cancer.

""This study would need to look at a much broader age range to fully understand whether men who undergo fertility treatment actually have a higher risk overall.

""If this can be proven, more research would then need to be done to determine the underlying cause. Until then, there is little evidence that there would be any benefit in monitoring these men more closely.""

He added: ""We believe it's important that all men are aware of the risks of prostate cancer, and men concerned about the disease should speak to their GP. However, couples considering fertility treatment should not be put off by these results."""

The Trump administration has released details of a phone conversation in July that has triggered a US impeachment inquiry against the president.

According to the notes, Donald Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to look into corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden, Mr Trump's possible rival in next year's presidential election.

Concerns about the call were initially raised by a whistleblower.

The Democrats accused Mr Trump of seeking foreign help to smear a rival.

Under the US constitution, a president can be impeached for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours"" - a procedure that can lead to removal from office.

In July, Mr Trump froze military aid to Ukraine but he has insisted that this was not used to put pressure on the new government in Kiev.

What does Trump say about Biden in the call?

Mr Trump discusses with his newly elected Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, the 2016 removal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, according to notes of their 25 July telephone conversation released by the White House.

The US president is quoted as saying in the half-hour call: ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair.

""A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.""

He continues: ""The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution [of Mr Biden's son] and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the [US] Attorney General would be great.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: 'It was going to be the call from hell. It turned out to be a nothing call'

""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.""

Mr Zelensky says in response: ""We will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.""

Thanking Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky says he stayed in Trump Tower in New York City during a previous visit to the US.

On the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes.

The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine.

What is the claim against Joe Biden?

Mr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin.

Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a board member.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry

Other Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption.

Mr Biden last year told a foreign policy event how he threatened to withhold $1bn in aid to Ukraine unless Mr Shokin was removed.

No evidence has come to light so far of wrongdoing by the Bidens.

How the controversy unfolded

18 July - President Trump orders White House aide to hold back almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine, report US media

25 July - President Trump speaks with Ukraine's leader in a 30-minute phone call

9 September - Congress learns of a whistleblower's complaint about the call, but is blocked by the Trump administration from viewing it

11 September - Military aid for Ukraine is cleared for release by the Pentagon and US Department of State

23 September - Trump confirms he withheld Ukrainian aid, saying it was due to concerns about ""corruption""

24 September - Trump says the aid was withheld so that other countries would pay more

What's the Trump-Ukraine story about?

What is the background of the call?

Mr Trump had promised that a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" of the 25 July call would be released.

But the details disclosed by the White House on Wednesday morning were notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in.

The July call occurred days after Mr Trump directed the US government to withhold about $391m (£316m) in military aid to Ukraine.

In the summary of the call, Mr Trump does not tell the Ukrainian president that US aid hinges upon him investigating Mr Biden.

But Mr Trump stresses the importance of US financial support, before pressing Mr Zelensky for action on the Democratic candidate.

""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,"" Mr Trump says.

What's the reference to 'CrowdStrike'?

In one of the most cryptic passages from the call, Mr Trump mentions a ""server"" and CrowdStrike.

He asks Mr Zelensky to ""do us a favour"" adding: ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.""

CrowdStrike is a cyber-security firm that was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate the 2016 hack of the party's email server.

That cyber-breach led to the leak of numerous emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

CrowdStrike determined a pair of hacking groups with suspected Russian ties was responsible for the hack.

Mr Trump has previously questioned why the DNC did not turn over the hacked email server to the FBI, instead of asking CrowdStrike to investigate.

The US president told the Associated Press news agency in April 2017 that he had ""heard"" CrowdStrike was ""owned by a very rich Ukranian"".

In the phone call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump appears to suggest the DNC server is stored somewhere in Ukraine.

What's the reaction?

On Wednesday morning at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Mr Trump said it was the ""single greatest witch hunt in American history"".

""The way you had that built up that call, it was going to be the call from hell,"" said Mr Trump, who is up for re-election in November 2020.

""It turned out to be a nothing call.""

Speaking alongside Mr Trump at the event, Mr Zelensky told reporters: ""You heard that we had a, I think, good phone call.

""It was normal. We spoke about many things, so I think you read it that nobody pushed me.""

""In other words, no pressure,"" interjected Mr Trump.

But California Democrat Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters the phone call shows ""a classic, mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader"".

What's happening with the impeachment inquiry?

The Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Tuesday threw her weight behind an official impeachment inquiry into the president's actions.

A House vote to impeach the president could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Mr Trump from office.

Congress' probe focuses partly on whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought to help his own re-election by seeking the aid of a foreign government to undermine Mr Biden.

Mrs Pelosi said such actions would mark a ""betrayal of his oath of office"" and declared: ""No one is above the law.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pelosi: ""The president must be held accountable; no one is above the law.""

How did the controversy arise?

The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the Director of National Intelligence in August about the Trump-Zelenksy call.

A whistleblower from within the US intelligence community had filed a complaint about the matter.

Federal law requires such complaints to be disclosed to Congress, but the Trump administration has so far refused to do so.

The US Department of Justice says the whistleblower had heard the information from ""White House officials"", and did not have first-hand knowledge of the call.

The department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said on Wednesday it had reviewed a record of the phone call, and determined ""there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was required""."

Cute, cuddly and loveable... just some of the words you might use to describe labradoodles.

But how about ""crazy"" or even a ""Frankenstein's monster"" with major health problems?

That's what the creator of the first ever labrador-poodle crossover says.

In a recent interview on an ABC podcast, Wally Conron says the invention is his ""life's regret"" and he hasn't ""got a clue"" why people are still breeding them today.

He's become concerned that an influx of copycat cross-breeds has created health problems for many dogs.

""I opened a Pandora's box"" Wally told ABC, ""I released a Frankenstein"".

""People are just breeding for the money ... unscrupulous breeders are crossing poodles with inappropriate dogs simply so they can say they were the first to do it.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some say they are the first designer dogs

The first designer dog?

Wally, who's Australian, created the labradoodle in the late 1980s.

It took a letter from a blind lady in Hawaii - whose husband was allergic to long-haired dogs - to spur Wally, then a breeding manager, into action. He decided to create a suitable guide dog for the couple.

After three years of trying to find a solution, in 1989 Wally came up with the idea of ""a dog with the working ability of the Labrador and the coat of the poodle"".

But despite his success, he feels regret because the labradoodle became ""a bandwagon"" - and his aim of only breeding healthy pups was not followed by others.

""I find that the biggest majority [of labradoodles] are either crazy or have a hereditary problem.""

Image copyright Martha Watton Image caption Martha says she's ""never met a crazy labradoodle""

'The perfect companion'

Many owners certainly won't recognise Wally's words, though.

For Martha Watton, 20, labradoodles like Barney are the dream dog.

""He has the perfect mix of lovingness, intelligence and everything. When I'm feeling down or stressed, he picks me up, comes for a cuddle and I feel better again,"" Martha told Radio 1 Newsbeat.

She adds Barney is ""the perfect companion for anyone of any age"".

""My grandad has dementia and we take Barney to see him at the care home and he's the perfect calm dog to have around - he doesn't bark.""

'A member of our family'

Grace Mandeville also agrees - she's owned Juno for nearly two years.‎

‎""She's a playful teddy bear who is obsessed with socks. Who ‎needs toys ‎for your dog when you have your own socks?‎

‎""‎She really is a member of our little family, plus I'm allergic to dogs and cats so there's a massive ‎bonus ‎that I can share a sofa with her and not feel wheezy.‎‎

‎""Every morning she sits by the side of our bed waiting for us to allow her to come and give me ‎and my ‎husband a cuddle.‎""

John Whitwell, a vet in York, says labradoodles are ""happy, healthy dogs"" with no major health problems.

""I don't think they're particularly crazy, they do seem to make good family pets, I don't think I've ever met one that was vicious or injured a family member.""

Keep calm and bark on...

But if you do have a particularly boisterous pooch, John says there are things you can do.

What if they won't stop barking? As annoying as it may be, don't tell them off because they'll become ""the centre of attention"".

""Take the dog away to a quiet area, leave it for 10 minutes and then let it out.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Enjoying the calm of nature

He also advises you to channel your inner zen to avoid your dog doing laps of the house.

""When you get home, you're obviously happy to see your dog and they're happy to see you. But if you immediately go and greet the dog and you're excited, you reinforce that it's an exciting time.""

""Just make a tea and once the dog has calmed down, only then say hello.""

Because as we know, a cup of tea and a dog is a winning combo.

A primary school has ditched bright plastic furniture and replaced it with plain wooden tables and chairs in a bid to help pupils focus.

Overdale Infant School in Knighton, Leicestershire, decided to make the change because pupils felt ""overloaded"" by bright, garish colours.

The school believes the new decor, which it describes as like ""grandma's living room"", will improve behaviour.

A colour expert said the furniture could give pupils a ""blank canvas"".

Headteacher Hayley Holmes said the school had trialled duller colours like brown and beige last year, and it had a positive impact on pupils' behaviour.

She said: ""Children and adults have none of that sensory overload and can feel really calm here.

""Some of the children felt overloaded and found the classroom to be a really difficult place to be in.

""So we're reducing that sensory overload and we're encouraging the children and giving them time to develop.""

Image caption Hayley Holmes said some pupils had found the classroom to be a difficult place to be in

Karen Haller, an expert of applied colour psychology, said colours were processed by the brain in the hypothalmus.

She added: ""When we take in colour we have an emotional reaction.

""Colour that's stimulating - like red - turns the emotional dial up.

""When you put in colours that are low in saturation, you're turning the emotional dial down.

""You can have a more calming, more restful environment.""

Conventional toys have also been ditched for objects like colanders, which the school hopes will help pupils develop role play.

One pupil said: ""It just looks nice, and the things in it, all the stuff makes it look wonderful.""

As a new group of students move in at the start of the current academic year, photographer Alice Zoo meets last year's residents and learns how it changed their outlook.

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption The Sustainability Bungalow was a former caretaker's house on Keele's Staffordshire campus

The idea of a sustainable living space on campus was the brainchild of a group of students on the Environment and Sustainability course at Keele University who wanted to put into practice the skills they were learning in lectures and field trips.

The university got behind the idea and found a disused caretaker's home alongside a small patch of land in which the students could grow vegetables.

Image copyright Alice Zoo

The project is overwhelmingly student-led, with the university running a host of modules ""empowering students to drive change"".

""The students took the idea that they can make a difference,"" says Prof Zoe Robinson.

""I am an optimist,"" she adds. ""It is great to see that the drive and the interest that the students have for this project.

""It is important that in universities we give students the space to develop these sorts of projects and the skills to create change.""

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption Professor Zoe Robinson

Each year four students are accepted into the bungalow, at least one of whom must be studying the environment. Others are drawn from across the curriculum, ensuring a wide range of experience and interests.

""One thing we don't have control over is what the student priorities are going to be,"" says Sarah Briggs, the Sustainability Project Officer at Keele.

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption Former Environment and Sustainability student Sarah Briggs now works at the university

Sarah says students have tended to focus on an issue they feel the university is not addressing, looking at ways to tackle that particular problem.

Most recently, the residents have concentrated on food wastage on campus.

Working in conjunction with VegSoc, a group looking at plant-based eating, they try to compost as much as they can outside the bungalow - and encourage others to do the same.

They have also worked to ensure kitchen utensils left behind by departing students are not just thrown away, but offered to those who may need them.

Like many students, Hannah Murray spent her first year in a shared house and found that, although they attempted to recycle food waste, it was a bit ""hit and miss"".

Once in the Sustainability Bungalow, Hannah found application became much more rigid - everything they could recycle they did.

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption Hannah Murray is studying chemistry

It's not just about those students living in the bungalow, but about spreading the word on campus and beyond.

Basic food recycling and turning off the lights are just some of the really easy things you can do, says Hannah.

""I have learnt to cook more and pick stuff without plastic on it,"" she says. ""That was hard. I thought I'd never be able to do it, but slowly I have and now I buy less plastic.""

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption Lily Woodhams in the polytunnel

Lily Woodhams, 23, is studying Environment and Sustainability. She can remember a lesson at primary school about climate change and how it affected her - from then on she was always telling her mum to turn off the lights.

As part of her degree course, she visited a centre for alternative technology in Wales investigating off-grid living.

""I was really inspired and thought the bungalow might be an opportunity to take stuff learnt there and apply it,"" says Lily.

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption A number of raised beds allow students to grow their own produce

In the bungalow, the students aim to live as sustainably as they can, but there are no set targets.

Lily says there are times when the whole challenge gets her down, especially when she reads news articles about plastics in the ocean.

""I sometimes think, what is the point in me even doing anything?"" she says.

""But then I took part in the Plastic Free Fortnight, a challenge set by the Environmental Justice Foundation.

""I was very public about this on Facebook and a girl I met last year, while travelling, messaged me and said I had inspired her to take part. That gave me hope.

""I know this is so small - and focusing on the consumer is not the best way to do it - but if everyone is more aware and has good practices in their lives then it will become the normal thing to do.""

""A small change is a big change, in a way.""

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption Lois Reeves in the Sustainability Bungalow

Lois Reeves has also found that living with others who are committed to a sustainable lifestyle has motivated her.

""I helped in the Welcome Week - encouraging people with the Green Society - but some people don't want to know,"" says Lois. ""As much as you want to spread the word and help people understand, they just might not want to - that is a challenge.""

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption Clothes swap at the Ethical Makers and Producers Fayre, part of Keele Green Festival

Like many of us, Lois wonders how much one person can do to fight climate change.

""I do my bit, I recycle, but how good is that?

""I don't do Environment and Sustainability as a degree, I do Environmental Science - which I picked more for management and soil science, not for climate change.

""While this is a big issue and I do little things to help, I don't think I am going to be the person to change the world.""

Image copyright Alice Zoo Image caption Lois Reeves in the garden

But living with the others has meant Lois is more engaged - and it has affected at least one person: her mum. Lois says she is now ""more passionate about it than me"".

""You don't have to have a house that has got all the latest sustainable technology to live sustainably,"" says Sarah. ""One of the biggest assets of the bungalow is that it shows what can be achieved by people through their behaviour.""

This could mean running an awareness campaign, altering your diet, growing vegetables and looking at how you shop.

""It is setting an example,"" says Sarah.

""What can seem overwhelming and challenging can sometimes have unexpected benefits,"" she adds. ""Meeting like-minded people and really creating a positive feeling of being empowered, that every little thing you do matters.""

Thomas Cook staff say they have been stranded overseas and fear they will not receive thousands of pounds in wages, following the collapse of the world's oldest tour operator.

Thomas Cook went into administration in the early hours of Monday morning after negotiations to raise fresh funding failed, leaving 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide - including 9,000 in the UK.

Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive of the firm, apologised to staff and customers after the collapse.

Staff told the BBC how the closure has affected them.

'I feel let down'

Married couple Hayley and Dan worked at Thomas Cook for a combined total of 34 years before they lost the jobs they loved.

Dan, 41, a pilot for the firm for 19 years, was told of the collapse by email before the official announcement was made at about 02.00 GMT.

Meanwhile Hayley, 36, a member of the cabin crew for 15 years, was watching the news unfold at home.

Hayley, who did not want to give her surname, told the BBC: ""At first, we were devastated at learning the news.

""Now it transpires that it seems to have been a long time coming.

""I feel let down. I feel like I've been thrown under a bus.""

The couple are due £8,000 in wages next Monday, but do not expect to receive them on time.

Hayley added: ""It was a good wage between us. Dan had worked overtime, we had a holiday to Florida in May to pay for, now we can't afford it.

""We have a bit of savings to cover the mortgage, and we are lucky we have family that can help in the short term, but we desperately need to get Dan, the main breadwinner in our house, a new job by Christmas.""

The couple from Manchester have two young daughters, aged five and three, to provide for.

She added that crew and pilots had been supporting each other with advice on signing on for jobseekers' allowance and help with mortgage and council tax repayments.

""It's a very real and immediate problem we have - we all have mortgages going out next week that we can't pay for"", she said.

""I don't think there's a fix within the week. I know a lot of crew have been ringing various organisations and just crying. I rang my gym earlier on Tuesday to cancel my membership and just cried down the phone to them.""

The couple are expecting to receive fact sheets and individual case numbers by post so they can reclaim money owed to them.

'Vulnerable staff abandoned'

The mother of a Thomas Cook entertainment worker based in Cyprus says ""vulnerable"" young staff have been left to fend for themselves.

The woman, who did not wish to identify herself or her daughter, told the BBC that she had to pay £480 for the 19-year-old to fly back to the UK.

She said: ""There is no one helping the other vulnerable young people who are out in other countries.

""The workers who are left in these countries have been on minimum wages of €500 (£440) per month. They don't have the means to get home.""

""They were put in touch with the British consulate, and were told there is nothing they could do for them because they're not Atol or Abta protected, and that it was up to the company's insurance to get them back home.

""When she arrived into work yesterday she was told she had to work, even though the company had gone into administration overnight.

""They said they needed everyone who was part of the team to stay until the last Thomas Cook holidaymaker has left.

""Anyone who decided not to stay had to write a letter of resignation.""

The woman's daughter was on a six-month contract with the company, and believes she will not be eligible to claim back any lost pay.

'Crews stranded abroad'

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'It's a mess for everybody', says former Thomas Cook pilot

David Crighton, a Thomas Cook pilot for 20 years, said losing his job had felt ""like a bereavement"".

Mr Crighton, from Cheshire, fears he will not be paid his £12,000 salary for this month, saying ""it won't be coming any time soon.""

He said: ""I worked pretty much everyday for a month for nothing. I am probably one of the lucky ones because my wife is in full time employment and I could pay my side of the mortgage for six months.

""The human effect of this is outrageous...the small people are going to be the ones that are really struggling.

""The first people to get paid should be the staff.""

He said he fears it will now be a ""bun fight"" to get another pilot's role, and may have to factor work abroad into his job search - though he says he needs Thomas Cook to sign his pilot's licence and flying hours for him to do this.

He added that some of his fellow crews were still stranded overseas, including one in Las Vegas, and were facing eye-watering prices for seats to fly home on another airline.

The crew in Las Vegas have now been given free flights home by another airline, he said."

Time is running out to preserve historic wall paintings around England that are at risk of deterioration and decay, English Heritage has warned.

The charity looks after 77 of the paintings, many of which decorate medieval abbeys, priories and churches.

It said the damp British climate and flawed restoration attempts threatened the artworks, some of which were older than the Sistine Chapel.

In an appeal, it said: ""We need the public's help, before time runs out.""

Paintings under threat included work at Lullingstone Roman Villa in Eynsford, Kent, and a Victorian gothic decoration at St Mary's Church in the grounds of Studley Royal Park in North Yorkshire.

Many depicted religious scenes, including the ""internationally-important"" art at St Mary's Church in Kempley, Gloucestershire, the charity said.

Unlike paintings in France and Italy that benefited from a warmer climate, England's damp weather could damage the fragile works.

'Precious insight'

The fact they were fixed to a wall also meant they could not be moved to a suitable place to preserve them.

Meanwhile, early 20th Century attempts at restoration had caused ""more harm than good"", English Heritage said.

Those practices included the use of soluble nylon to prevent damage, which had caused increased flaking of paint, it explained.

Image copyright English Heritage Image caption Urgent work has already begun on the medieval paintings at Longthorpe Tower in Peterborough

An audit to assess the deterioration had begun as had urgent work on those most at risk, it added.

These included medieval paintings at Longthorpe Tower in Peterborough, World War One graffiti at Richmond Castle in North Yorkshire, and the Archer Pavilion roof at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, which needed securing.

Conservation work included examining layers of paint with imaging techniques and undoing outdated methods of preservation.

Launching its appeal, the English Heritage's senior collections conservator Rachel Turnbull said: ""Wall paintings are the most challenging type of art to care for but they offer a precious insight into England's story.

""People of the past have left little traces, glimpses into their everyday lives through richly decorated wall paintings.

""If they are to survive for future generations to enjoy, we need the public's help today to repair their buildings, stabilise their structures and protect them from damp and decay before time runs out."""

A man is challenging his conviction for raping a woman who willingly slept with him after he falsely claimed to have had a vasectomy. How can someone be guilty of rape if their partner has agreed to sex, and what implications does the case have?

""I have a confession. I'm still fertile. Sorry xxx""

Sally - not her real name - was distraught as she read the text message from Jason Lawrance, a man she had met through a dating website. ""Are you serious?"" she texted back. ""You utter bastard. Why the hell would you do that to me?""

Before Sally had sex with Lawrance he told her he'd had ""the snip"" and she consented to having sex without a condom, but would never have done so if she had known Lawrance was fertile. She also had no idea he was a serial rapist.

Then 42 and already a mother, Sally did not want another child. She took the morning after pill but became pregnant, then went through the ordeal of having an abortion.

Image copyright Derbyshire pPolice Image caption Jason Lawrance is appealing against his convictions for raping Sally

Lawrance, previously of Leicestershire, went on to be convicted of raping Sally twice - because they'd had sex two times - in a case with no known precedent in the UK.

""Section 74 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 says a person consents if he or she agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice,"" said Sue Matthews, the senior crown prosecutor who put the case together. ""By lying about the vasectomy he deprived that particular victim of making an informed choice.""

""If these convictions are upheld on appeal, the concern is that members of the public, both male and female, who have never been considered criminals in the eyes of the law will be at risk of prosecution for serious sexual offences,"" said Lawrance's solicitor Shaun Draycott.

Lawrance is far from alone in deceiving a sexual partner to get sex. So could others who do this now face prosecution?

Could removing a condom count as rape?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Men's main stated reason for avoiding condoms was to make sex more pleasurable

Kelly Davis, an associate professor at Arizona State University, has surveyed men and women aged 21-30 about ""condom use resistance"", meaning the tactics employed to avoid using condoms when the other partner wants to. Out of the 313 men participating, 23.4% admitted to having used ""deception"" at least once since the age of 14.

The most common tactic was lying about planning to withdraw before ejaculation but not actually intending to (19.9%), followed by lying about having been tested for STDs and being STD-free (9.6%).

Dr Davis and her fellow researchers also did focus groups with young men. ""The place that these men drew the line was anything involving physical force,"" she said. ""Anything up to that line is just part of the game, because that was how some of the young men in this group viewed it.""

Of the 530 women surveyed, 6.6% admitted to having used deception at least once since the age of 14, with the most common tactic being pretending to be on birth control.

Dr Davis and her colleagues also researched the practice of ""stealthing"", which means agreeing to use a condom then surreptitiously removing it before or during sex. Again, the men surveyed were aged 21-30. Almost 10% of the 626 participating admitted having engaged in stealthing at least once since the age of 14.

""I was shocked that it was almost 10% that reported doing this, and at an average of over three times,"" Dr Davis said. ""So they are not just doing it once - well some are - but many of them are doing it multiple times. It's disturbing.""

Twelve per cent of the women surveyed reported knowing that stealthing had happened to them, although some might never have realised it had happened. Many people would not consider stealthing to be rape, but Sandra Paul, a solicitor who specialises in cases of sexual misconduct, believes it is under UK law.

The issue was considered by judges as part of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange's extradition case, and their judgment said sex without a condom would be a sexual offence in the UK if the other partner had only agreed on the condition a condom was used.

What if a man doesn't withdraw?

Katie Russell, national spokesperson for Rape Crisis, believes that lying about the intention to withdraw before ejaculation falls under the legal definition of rape. ""That's an example of someone having agreed to sex with conditions, and the other party having reneged on those agreed conditions,"" she said.

Ms Paul said a such a case has already been considered by a UK court, and it involved a husband and wife. ""She didn't want to have any further children and agreed to have sex provided he withdrew before he ejaculated,"" said Ms Paul. ""He seemingly agreed to that but there was sufficient evidence to show he had no intention to withdraw.""

The CPS decided not to prosecute the husband for rape, so the wife applied for a judicial review of the decision. ""The Admin Court made it quite clear that in their view there was good reason for the CPS to consider charging; what happened was capable of amounting to an offence in that her consent had been negated by his never intending to withdraw,"" said Ms Paul. ""It was sent back to the CPS for them to review their decision based on what the court had said.""

The BBC asked the CPS whether the husband was ever prosecuted but it could not provide the information.

Could lying about an STI test count as rape?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In one survey of young men, 9.6% admitted lying about having been tested for STIs and being STI-free

Ms Paul thinks lying about having had an STI test is more of a grey area.

""It's difficult,"" she said. ""I think that, probably, if we were taking baby incremental steps from the decision that's been made about Lawrance, as we must do in the absence of legislation, then potentially.""

There have already been several prosecutions of men who infected partners with HIV, with Daryll Rowe, Antonio Reyes-Minana and Aaron Sutcliffe being three recent examples. However, they were charged with causing grievous bodily harm, rather than sexual offences.

What if a woman lies about being on the pill?

Lawrance's defence barrister Clive Stockwell QC compared his client's lie about the vasectomy to a woman lying about being on the contraceptive pill. He argued that if Lawrance were convicted of rape for lying about being infertile, then a woman could arguably be convicted of a sexual offence for a similar act of deceit.

Under current UK law, a woman cannot be prosecuted for raping a man because rape is defined under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 as an offence of penetration committed with a penis.

Ms Russell has a problem with the vasectomy and contraceptive pill comparison. ""With issues around contraception and pregnancy, it's the woman whose body and life and health is affected by that kind of lie,"" she said. ""That is not in any way comparing like for like, because it's a woman who has to deal with the consequences of pregnancy and termination, and, in the example given, the impacts on the man are not of a comparable kind.""

But Ms Paul is not so sure. ""The issue is the extent to which the lie vitiates (negates) consent,"" she said. ""If a man finds himself a father of a child under these circumstances, there are all sorts of consequences that flow from that.

""It might be argued there is a double standard. In so many walks of life we [women] have achieved equality and demand to be treated with the same level of respect as men. Where the lie deemed to create criminal liability is exactly the same, I think it is problematic to carve out areas where we are protected solely because we are women.""

What if someone lies about their gender?

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Gayle Newland pretended to be a man, persuaded her sexual partner to wear a blindfold and penetrated her using a prosthetic penis

There have been several prosecutions where women have impersonated men in order to have sexual encounters with other women, or where trans men have not disclosed their assigned gender to female partners. Notable cases include Gayle Newland, Justine McNally and Kyran Lee.

Many such cases involve the use of a dildo and, since rape is an offence of penetration committed with a penis, the charge brought is one of sexual assault or assault by penetration. In the case of McNally, who presented as a teenage boy throughout a relationship with a teenage girl, the Court of Appeal determined that ""deception as to gender can vitiate consent"".

However, cases like these, sometimes called ""gender fraud"", have raised questions about the rights of people with gender dysphoria, and whether or not transgender people should have to disclose their assigned sex to partners. Barrister and law professor Alex Sharpe, who has been involved in transgender law reform and activism for over 20 years, is among those with concerns.

""Most of the people prosecuted on the basis of sexual fraud appear to be gender non-conforming, so there's an issue of the singling out of particular kinds of people or transgression for prosecution,"" she said. Prof Sharpe believes a trans man is not deceiving a female partner if he presents himself as a man, because he is a man.

What about other lies?

People tell all sorts of lies in order to have a sexual relationship, such as lying about their age, pretending to be single when they are married, or claiming to be more wealthy than they really are. However, cases like these have not ended up in court, so jurors have not been asked to consider whether or not such lies negate consent.

Several women have had sexual relationships with undercover police officers embedded in activist groups. One of these women argued this amounted to ""a team of officers conspiring to rape"", because the officers knew there was no informed consent.

Police have given some of the women compensation, however the CPS declined to bring charges against any of the officers, saying that ""any deceptions in the circumstances of this case were not such as to vitiate consent"".

Ms Paul believes more guidance is needed about the extent to which lies negate consent - and this will hopefully come in the form of a judgment from the Court of Appeal now the Lawrance convictions are being challenged.

""Ultimately it may well be that legislation is required,"" she said. ""Failing to wear a condom when you said you would, I think clearly on the face of the legislation as it stands, is problematic but an adult lying about their age in most circumstances probably isn't.

""In the absence of specific legislation, who makes the rules about what's in between, and how are juries to navigate these decisions?""

Thousands of Chilean children were stolen from their mothers during the military rule of Gen Augusto Pinochet and sent abroad for adoption. A government investigation is looking into how the babies were taken.

Sara Jineo is still extremely upset about what happened when she took her four-day-old baby boy, Camilo, to the hospital in Temuco, southern Chile, in 1988.

""They tricked me,"" she says. ""They made me go to the hospital and said they were going to do a blood test on my baby.""

But the woman who took Camilo out of her arms never brought him back. ""I looked all over the hospital and when I went outside and asked a policeman for help, he looked at me, laughed, and said I was mad,"" she says.

Sara, who still lives outside Temuco, has been looking for her son for the last 30 years. She is convinced he was taken abroad. She says a local taxi driver told her about a woman taking a crying baby to the local airport on the same day Camilo disappeared. The child was apparently wrapped in the same distinctive baby blanket she had used.

Her situation is not unique. Sara is part of a generation of mothers and children trying to find each other after being involuntarily separated during Gen Augusto Pinochet's military rule from 1973 to 1990.

Many of the mothers, including Sara, were Mapuche, the largest indigenous community in Chile.

Making up around 7.5% of the 17 million population, they often live in poverty in rural areas in the south and say they are treated like second-class citizens, deprived of their land and culture.

Image caption Sara has kept the baby's hospital bracelet from when he was born

Though illegal adoptions did not start during the Pinochet years - and many were also going on in neighbouring Argentina - they were ramped up under his rule, and with a specific aim.

The Pinochet government wanted to eliminate extreme poverty, particularly among children. The strategy was to simply take children out of the country, according to Jeanette Velásquez, who works for volunteer group Hijos y Madres del Silencio (Children and Mothers of Silence).

She says social workers, nuns, doctors, lawyers and international adoption agencies were all involved in a slick operation, which sent babies to developed countries, including Holland, the United States, Sweden and Germany.

""Some women tell me horrific stories about how they were breast-feeding their baby when it was pulled from their arms. There was a lot of violence,"" she says.

Image caption Jeanette Velásquez (right) is helping Sara to look for her child via her volunteer network

In other cases, the pressure was more psychological. Social workers would tell mothers they were too poor to keep the child, or that they had too many other children already to cope with another.

Vulnerable mothers, mainly single mothers, were specifically targeted.

Some women were forced to sign paperwork they did not understand. Some were even told their children had died.

What happened?

Some 20,000 children were adopted by foreign couples during the Pinochet era

Chile's Court of Appeals says at least 8,000 of those are suspicious cases

Some activists believe that number is much higher

Almost 200 mothers have been reunited with their children

Alejandro Quezada's mother was one of those women. She was just 14 and a single mother, from a rural area outside of Valdivia, in the country's south.

Shortly after giving birth at home, she took her baby son for a check-up at the local hospital. There, he was whisked away from her, with staff insisting he was ill. She was later told he had died and his body had already been disposed of.

""When she started screaming, they gave her an injection and she didn't wake up for three days,"" says Alejandro.

Women like Alejandro's birth mother were never given death certificates or allowed to see the body of their child. They were told it would upset them and the climate of fear during the Pinochet era stopped them from asking further questions.

Alejandro only started piecing the story together much later in life. In 1979, when he was just a few weeks old, he was sent to The Netherlands.

Image copyright Courtesy of Alejandro Quezada Image caption Alejandro was sent to The Netherlands as a baby

He says he was adopted by a Dutch couple who considered themselves part of the Flower Power generation and wanted to help poorer countries. They were told his mother had voluntarily given him up for adoption.

""During my teenage years, I had so many questions about my identity,"" says Alejandro. ""Even though I love and appreciate my adoptive parents, I felt depressed and alone and went off the rails.""

Image caption Alejandro Quezada has been trying to piece his history together

In 1997, when he was 17 years old, he travelled to Chile with his adoptive family to meet the Dutch nun who had arranged his adoption. She took Alejandro to meet his birth mother.

He immediately noted their physical resemblance, but it was not an easy encounter. ""I had so many questions for her and it was very frustrating, because we couldn't understand each other and the nun wouldn't let us see each other for very long,"" he says.

Alejandro, who had grown up speaking Dutch, decided he needed to learn Spanish so he and his birth mother could talk to each other without a translator.

It was not until he was 30 and living in Chile that he finally learned the truth: his mother had never wanted to give him up but had been told he was dead.

Image copyright Courtesy of Alejandro Quezada Image caption It took years for Alejandro to learn that his mother had not wanted to give him up for adoption

The nun who arranged the adoption and used to shuttle back and forth between the two countries is now living in The Netherlands.

She has spoken publicly about the adoptions she was involved in and has insisted that she did the right thing. She said she believed that she created better lives for Alejandro and the various other children given in adoption.

Alejandro's experiences led him to found a charity, Chilean Adoptees Worldwide, which helps other adoptees find their mothers.

The search is often arduous. The adoption documents rarely list the full names of both parents. Sometimes names and identity numbers were deliberately changed.

Alejandro has found the registry office in the capital, Santiago, to be a good source of information, as original handwritten birth certificates sometimes hold clues.

A government investigation started in 2018 as mothers demanded answers about why their children were taken from them against their will.

A growing number of people who were taken as children from their biological mothers also started discovering the truth behind their adoptions.

Because of the growing number of complaints a special police unit was formed last March, which is working with mothers in regions where many of the children were thought to have been taken.

A DNA test has become the final piece in the puzzle. The government and charities helping the mothers want them to do the test so their DNA forms part of a central data bank managed by the government that will help adoptees find matches.

But the women are expected to pick up the costs themselves and each kit costs around $100 (£83) - which is around half a month's salary for the majority of them.

Jaime Balmaceda, a judge at the Court of Appeals, is involved in the government investigation. He is in charge of working out which of the adoptions were legitimate and which were not.

His theory is that money was changing hands and that is what he is trying to prove.

Not everyone is convinced the investigators are digging deep enough. Critics think that the Chilean state is trying to shield the judges, social workers, nuns and others involved in getting the children out of the country from prosecution.

Those who want to see justice done say the advanced age and poor health of some of those suspected of involvement in the forced adoption scheme should not be a barrier to prosecution.

Mr Balmaceda says delays in the investigation are not deliberate but that the process is long and often hampered by missing paperwork. ""We are not trying to protect anyone, or waiting for people to die so they can't be brought to justice,"" he insists.

For Alejandro, jail-time for those behind his forced adoption has never been the goal.

The nun who arranged for him to be sent to The Netherlands recently visited Chile and faced questioning as part of the government investigation. But Alejandro says he does not want her to go to prison as she is in her 80s now.

""We've been treated inhumanely, but that doesn't mean that we should treat other people like that."" Making sure something like this never happens again is more important to him.

""If you want to adopt because you want to help, that is one of the most noble things in the world,"" he says. ""But you need to make sure you have all the information, because children will have questions about their biological roots and you need to make sure that you know the answers.""

Producers, promoters and publishers turned down Melanie Blake's story The Thunder Girls for two decades because it's about four women in their 50s, the writer says. Now the tale of a former girl group is a book and sold-out play.

Pop reunions are big business, but one thing fans are even more fascinated to see than their idols back on stage is how they really get on behind the scenes (or not). The response to the hilariously revealing Bros documentary proved that.

Melanie Blake saw the truth about pop stars' personal relationships while working on Top of the Pops in the 1990s, as a journalist and then as an agent. She used to manage Bros's Luke Goss, as well as Steps' Claire Richards and Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp.

While she was a freelance journalist, a magazine assigned her to write about life on a 1980s reunion tour. ""I went on the tour bus. It was absolutely hell,"" she says.

""Everybody hated each other. People wouldn't talk to each other, and then they'd be like, 'Hello Wembley!'

""They'd sing their songs, and then they'd all come back and immediately get in different parts of the bus and wouldn't speak to each other.""

Image copyright Nicky Johnston Image caption Blake has managed former members of Steps, Five Star, Spandau Ballet and Bros

So she swears that The Thunder Girls, her deliciously bitchy story of an '80s girl group who get back together to discuss a reunion 30 years after a toxic break-up, is not far from the truth.

""Every band from Fleetwood Mac to Steps and the Rolling Stones have got missing members and have all had these meetings,"" she says. All five Spice Girls met up last year, she points out - but only four ended up going on the reunion trail.

""What happened at that dinner party that meant Victoria Beckham went 'I can't do this'? Every band that reforms has to have a reunion dinner to see if old wounds can be healed enough so that the blood stops seeping whilst they're on the stage. That's what nobody ever sees.""

The Thunder Girls are meant to have been prototype Spice Girls, and certainly have girl power. But their wounds run deep.

Resentment and jealousy about romantic betrayals, financial skulduggery and career-ending bad behaviour have built up over decades.

Blake, from Stockport, wrote the first version in 1999. She eventually published the Thunder Girls novel in July and used the book advance to finance a stage version starring Coronation Street's Beverley Callard, Nolan sister Coleen, Emmerdale's Sandra Marvin and ex-EastEnders star Carol Harrison.

The characters have to decide whether a big pay cheque can overcome the fact that they hate each other's guts. There are some fabulously catty lines. ""Did you have a lift on both of your faces?"" asks the hard-up Roxie, played by Callard, of Harrison's Chrissie, who has overshadowed her former bandmates as a TV talent show judge and tabloid favourite.

Image copyright Robert Martin Image caption The show broke a ticket sales record at The Lowry

Nolan plays Anita, who dropped off the radar after a disastrous Eurovision appearance. As one of the Nolans, one of the biggest groups of the late '70s and early '80s, she also brings some insight.

""Oh my god, I've known bands over the years that genuinely, apart from when they're on stage, can't stand each other,"" she says. ""They all have separate dressing rooms and separate cars. But when they're on stage, it works.""

Despite the fact that Blake managed the Nolans' lucrative 2009 tour, they insist that was one reunion that did not inspire The Thunder Girls. ""We were sisters, so there was no toxic fallout,"" says Nolan.

The Thunder Girls stage show, directed by Joyce Branagh (sister of Sir Ken), is on at The Lowry arts centre in Salford for just five nights and broke the record for the fastest ticket sales for a new play in the venue's Quays theatre.

It has gone down particularly well with women of the same age as the characters, who can relate to the themes of ageing and long-term friendships.

Blake is already talking about taking it to London's West End, and the initial response is vindication after two decades of being told that a story about four middle-aged women would never work.

Image copyright Robert Martin Image caption Chrissie (Carol Harrison) and Roxie (Beverley Callard) are at each other's throats

""First it was picked up as a book. And then publishers said 'Well, we'll do it, but we think it should be based on younger women.' And I said no.""

Then the rights were optioned by a TV company, she says. ""They came back and said 'We like it, but we think they should be 35.' I said, 'No, they have to be in their 50s because they have to be women. They have to have lived, loved and lost.'

""And then last year, when we started looking at the stage show and we started looking at investors and promoters, they were all like 'What, four women? Over 50? Singing? And they actually still think they're it, do they?'""

Callard, best known for playing Liz McDonald in Coronation Street, says ageism and sexism are still rife in the entertainment world.

""More often than not you look at a film script, or you look at plays or films or television things that have been made, and you would get 10 male actors in it and maybe two women if you're lucky,"" she says.

""More often than not, you would see a husband who's maybe 50 with a 30-year-old wife. It happens all the time.

""Our business is so sexist and so anti-women. When Melanie told me about this play, and when I read it, I just said 'I've got to do this'. Because it's about real women.""

'No expiration dates'

Speaking during a break in rehearsals, Blake says a male-dominated force in the entertainment industry (""Let's call it 'the man'"") has tried to dictate what people want to see.

""It shouldn't be the case that there's only one woman in every show, or that there's only one older woman. I've just watched four women over 50 smash it.

""It's electric because they've lived lives. Too many people like to write women off with expiration dates.

""Women don't have expiration dates. Life only makes them more interesting.""

The Thunder Girls is at The Lowry in Salford until 28 September. Melanie Blake's novel is published by Pan McMillan.

China's economy has been slowing for the better part of the past decade, but a recent run of poor data has prompted fresh concerns. What is making investors nervous, and how China has responded?

China became a key engine of world economic growth as developed countries licked their wounds after the 2008 global financial crisis.

Now, the world's second-largest economy is expanding at its slowest pace since the early 1990s.

China saw industrial output grow at its slowest pace since 2002 in August.

Weeks later China's Premier Li Keqiang said it would not be easy for the country to sustain growth rates of above 6%.

Domestic issues, the US-led trade war, and swine fever are all putting a break on China's rapid expansion.

""The slowdown in China is becoming quite significant,"" says Tommy Wu, senior Asia economist at Oxford Economics.

""Both the weakening in the domestic economy and deteriorating external environment, including both a global slowdown, and the US-China trade tensions, have a role to play in China's slowdown.""

Given China's importance in the global economy, and its healthy demand for anything from commodities to machinery, any downturn is likely to have far-reaching consequences.

Gary Hufbauer, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that a one percentage point drop in Chinese growth would probably take 0.2 percentage points off global growth.

What is happening in China?

The official data paints an increasingly cloudy outlook.

Industrial output is growing at its weakest pace since 2002, and retail sales are slowing.

Chinese exports fell in August by 1% from a year earlier, and by a sharp 16% to the US - a clear sign that the dispute with the US is hurting bilateral trade.

But while growth is down from double digit levels in the mid-2000's, the more recent slowdown has been relatively gradual.

China's economy grew 6.2% year-on-year in the second quarter, easing from 6.4% in the first three months of the year, and from 6.6% in 2018.

""It's not as if Chinese growth has completely fallen off a cliff,"" says Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC.

""On the contrary, there are still many pockets of growth,"" he adds, pointing to housing construction and spending in the services sector.

How effective has stimulus been?

China's government has sought to support the economy this year through tax cuts, and by taking measures to boost liquidity in the financial system.

But Mr Neumann says that this time around, the government was being ""fairly restrained"" when providing credit to firms and individuals, and administering stimulus.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Chinese government has been careful to limit its economic stimulus moves

That's because the government believes China needs to curb the risk in its financial system, and cool the rapid credit growth of recent years, he adds.

""Chinese authorities are not really showing signs of wavering from this track... so it's by design in many ways, rather than by accident, that we've seen weaker economic growth numbers,"" says Mr Neumann.

Having relied heavily on infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy over the years, analysts say Beijing had limited room to do much more on that front.

Instead they have opted for tax cuts, which tend to be less effective in boosting growth than infrastructure spending, says Mr Wu.

Mr Wu expected Beijing to do more to stimulate the economy going forward - both through fiscal and monetary policy - but worried this would not be enough.

""We do expect more to come to help stabilise growth by next year. But the key downside risk is that the authorities do not step up policy support enough to stabilise growth.""

What has been the fallout from the trade war?

The US and China have been fighting a trade war for more than a year, and more tariffs are expected.

The impact from the US tariffs has been offset to some extent by a weaker yuan, says Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics, while China has also sought to bypass the taxes by exporting to the US via other Asian countries.

He says that China's share of global exports has actually grown over the past year, showing that the fall in Chinese exports has been less pronounced than those from other countries.

Western businesses, meanwhile, are finding it increasingly hard to navigate the uncertainty.

Some have been shifting production out of China, even though the numbers have not been large enough to show up in the economic data, says Mr Evans-Pritchard.

""The longer these tariffs remain in place, the longer this drags on, the higher the chance we are going to see more firms shifting out of China, and it also makes the country a less attractive place to invest in the first place,"" he says.

While many firms will want to keep some production in China to cater for its important domestic market, there are signs some firms are already considering their options.

According to a 2019 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, 65% of members said trade tensions are influencing their longer-term business strategies. Nearly a fourth of all respondents are delaying China investments, it said.

How about the swine fever outbreak?

The deadly swine fever has placed an additional drag on the Chinese economy over the past year.

China, the world's biggest producer of pork, has struggled to control the disease even after slaughtering more than one million pigs.

The supply shortage has sent pork prices soaring - by 46.7% in August on a year earlier- and that is eating into household incomes.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

""The price of pork has almost doubled,"" said the Peterson Institute's Hufbauer, adding that this was ""very painful for low income Chinese.""

Pork is one of China's main food staples, and accounts for more than 60% of the country's meat consumption.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese shoppers have had to endure a big rise in the price of staple meat pork

While for now the surge has been partly offset by more subdued non-food inflation, analysts say this could quickly change.

""What worries me is that they just don't seem to have gotten the disease under control yet. The pig stock is still falling,"" says Mr Evans-Pritchard.

""At this stage it's already pointing towards pork price inflation rising above 80% year-on-year within the next six months."""

It was 27 August 1859, and a crucial message had been sent. Entrepreneur Edwin Drake's last financial backer had finally lost patience. Pay off your debts, give up and come home, the message read.

Drake had been hoping to find ""rock oil"", a brownish unrefined ""crude"" oil that sometimes bubbled near the surface of western Pennsylvania. He planned to refine it into kerosene, for lamps - a substitute for increasingly expensive whale oil.

There would also be less useful by-products, such as gasoline, but if he couldn't find a buyer for that he could always pour it away.

The message had been sent, but Drake had not yet received it when his drill bit punctured an underground reservoir full of crude oil under pressure. From 69 ft (21m) beneath the surface, the oil began to rise.

The whales had been saved, and the world was about to change.

Just a few miles south and a few years later, came a hint of what lay in store.

When oil was struck at Pithole, Pennsylvania, in 1864, ""there were not 50 inhabitants within half a dozen miles"", according to the New York Times.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pithole City at the height of its short-lived oil boom in 1865

A year later, Pithole had at least 10,000 inhabitants, 50 hotels, one of the country's busiest post offices, two telegraph stations and dozens of brothels.

A few men made fortunes, but a real economy is complex and self-sustaining. Pithole was neither, and within another year, it was gone.

Its oil boom did not last, but our thirst for the fuel grew and grew. The modern economy is drenched in oil.

50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.

It's the source of more than a third of the world's energy.

That's more than coal, and more than twice as much as nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy sources combined.

Oil and gas together provide a quarter of our electricity, and the raw material for most plastics.

Then there's transport.

Edwin Drake may have questioned who would buy gasoline, but the internal combustion engine was about to give him an answer. From cars to trucks, cargo ships to jet planes, oil-derived fuel still moves us - and stuff - around.

No wonder the price of oil is arguably the most important single price in the world.

In 1973, when some Arab states declared an embargo on sales to several rich nations, prices surged from $3 to $12 a barrel in just six months.

It led to a global slowdown, with US recessions following subsequent price spikes in 1978, 1990, and 2001. Some economists even believe that record high oil prices played an important role in the global recession of 2008, which is conventionally blamed on the banking crisis alone.

As oil goes, so goes the economy.

So why did we become so excruciatingly dependent on the stuff?

Image copyright Getty Images

Daniel Yergin's magisterial history of oil, The Prize, begins with a dilemma for Winston Churchill.

Churchill was made head of the Royal Navy in 1911.

One of his first decisions was whether the British Empire would meet the challenge of an expansionist Germany with new battleships powered by safe, secure Welsh coal, or by oil from faraway Persia - modern-day Iran.

Why would anyone rely on such an insecure source? Because oil-fired battleships would accelerate more quickly and sustain a higher speed, required fewer men to deal with the fuel and would have more capacity for guns and ammunition.

Oil was simply a better fuel than coal.

Churchill's ""fateful plunge"" in April 1912 reflected the same logic that has governed our dependence on oil - and shaped global politics - ever since.

After Churchill's decision, the British Treasury bought a majority stake in the Anglo-Persian oil company - the ancestor of BP.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An oil strike at an Anglo-Persian Oil Company field in 1909

In 1951, it was nationalised by the government of Iran. Our company, protested the British. Our oil, responded the Iranians. The argument would be repeated around the world over the subsequent decades.

Some countries did well. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest on the planet, thanks to its large oil reserves.

Its state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, is worth more than Apple or Google or Amazon.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Saudi Aramco operates in 28 locations around the world and employs around 76,000 people

Still, nobody would mistake Saudi Arabia for a complex, sophisticated economy such as that of Japan or Germany. It's perhaps a bit more like Pithole on a grander scale.

Elsewhere, from Iraq to Iran, Venezuela to Nigeria, few oil-rich countries have prospered from the discovery. Economists call it the ""curse of oil"".

Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, Venezuela's oil minister in the early 1960s, had a more vivid description. ""It is the devil's excrement,"" he declared in 1975. ""We are drowning in the devil's excrement.""

More things that made the modern economy:

Why is it a problem to have lots of oil?

Exporting it pushes up the value of your currency - which can make everything other than oil prohibitively expensive to produce at home.

That means it can be hard to develop manufacturing or complex service industries.

Historically, many politicians have tried to monopolise their country's oil for themselves and their allies. Dictatorships are not uncommon. There is money - for some - but such economies tend to be thin and brittle.

That's one reason we might hope for something to replace oil. Climate change, obviously, is another.

But oil has so far stubbornly resisted giving way to batteries. This is because machines that move around need to carry their own source of power with them - the lighter the better.

A kilogram of petrol stores as much energy as 60kg of batteries, and has the convenient property of disappearing after use. Empty batteries, alas, are just as heavy as full ones.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Electric car company Tesla is also developing pioneering battery technology

Electric cars are finally starting to break through. Electric jumbo jets are a tougher challenge.

There was a time when it seemed as though oil might simply start to run out - ""peak oil"" was the phrase - pushing prices ever higher, and giving us the impetus to move to a clean, renewable economy.

In fact, oil is being discovered far more quickly than it is being consumed.

This is partly thanks to the rapid growth of hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking"", a controversial process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped underground under high pressure to release oil and gas.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US Energy Information Administration estimates that about half of the total US crude oil production comes from fracking

Fracking is more like manufacturing than traditional exploration and production.

It's standardised, enjoying rapid productivity gains and the process starts and stops depending on whether the price is right.

Many critics have expressed fears about its potential long-term environmental consequences.

However, the Permian Basin - home of the US fracking industry - already produces more oil than the 14 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) group, apart from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

It seems we are still drowning in the Devil's Excrement, and may continue to do so for some time.

Sherele Moody is no stranger to violence. In addition to spending her spare time documenting the violent deaths of Australian women and children, she has an intense personal experience of it.

From a young age, she was subjected to years of violent abuse by her mother. Each time her mother hurt her, she'd run away - before eventually being returned by welfare authorities.

But her most intense experience, one that has shaped her life since, happened to a young girl she had never met.

In 1990, Ms Moody's stepfather abducted, raped and murdered nine-year-old Stacey-Ann Tracy, then dumped her body in a creek in a rubbish bag.

'Feeling in the pit of my stomach'

Ms Moody was just 18 when Barry Hadlow killed Stacey-Ann in rural Queensland, and recalls vividly events which happened afterwards.

The teenager had just returned to her mother's home because her younger sister, Karen, said she was having a tough time. ""I left my job and came straight back to ensure she was ok,"" she says.

Image copyright Courtesy of The Courier-Mail Image caption Barry Hadlow was arrested and found guilty of murder while on parole

Her stepfather picked her up and, on the drive back to the family home, was telling her how a young girl had gone missing from the area.

""He seemed excited to be joining the search the next day,"" she says. ""I remember him putting his State Emergency Service volunteer uniform on and heading off.""

The next thing she remembers is several loud bangs on the door and feeling ""gobsmacked"" to see police stream in and search the house.

She went on to become witness for the Crown against her stepfather. Her mother, Leonie, stayed with and defended Hadlow - whom she had married when Ms Moody was 15. ""She was his biggest backer in court. It was sad to watch,"" Ms Moody says.

Ms Moody even attended Stacey-Ann's funeral. ""I can still feel the horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing my stepfather did this - and mum was standing by him,"" she says.

Image copyright The Tracy family Image caption Stacey-Ann Tracy, nine, was raped and murdered by Hadlow

Another shock was in store: this wasn't the first time her stepfather had killed.

Police informed Ms Moody that, 27 years earlier, he had abducted and murdered a five-year-old girl, Sandra Bacon. Her body was wrapped in a corn sack and left in a car boot.

Hadlow had lived near each of his victims and was on parole when he murdered Stacey-Ann. ""The system gave him an opportunity when it shouldn't have,"" Ms Moody says.

Ms Moody's mother ""never wavered"" in her support of Hadlow, leading to an estrangement: ""I felt betrayed by her. She brought into the house a killer who'd abducted a girl the same age as my twin sisters.""

Image copyright The Bacon family Image caption Sandra Bacon was murdered by Barry Hadlow when she was five

Now 48, Ms Moody hasn't seen her mother since she was 21. Hadlow died in prison in 2007.

Guilt - then anger

Ms Moody says she ""went off the rails"" and was ""not living a very good life"" after Hadlow's arrest, but later found purpose by completing her schooling and becoming a journalist.

""My entire adult life, I've lived with the guilt of him killing Stacey-Ann,"" she says. ""Not a day goes by I don't think about her.""

In recent years, her guilt morphed into anger. She knew she needed to do something in her spare time to funnel it, which is how the Australian Femicide and Child Death Map was born.

Using Google Maps, Ms Moody is documenting every violent death of women and children in Australia, so far dating back to the 1800s.

Image copyright Sherele Moody Image caption Each heart on this map represents a child or woman murdered in Australia

She uses the skills from her day job as a journalist to memorialise these women and children, so they're no longer just grim statistics.

""It upset me that Stacey-Ann's death wouldn't be remembered after her family and people like me moved on,"" she says.

""Every country commemorates its soldiers but not those who die of violence. I wanted to document the true extent, impact and gendered nature of violence on our communities. The fact is, whether you're a man, woman or child, you're most likely to be killed by a man.

""We can use their stories to make change moving forward, in particular about male violence - by addressing the attitudes towards women that drive it.""

On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner in Australia, according to the most recent Australian Institute of Criminology statistics.

Each heart on the interactive map clicks through to a story of a violent death, containing original research from Ms Moody, based on newspaper archives, coroner's reports and appeal judgements.

It features tales of neglect, family and domestic violence and stranger violence. Details of what happened to the perpetrator are included. A voice is given to the victim's family, where possible.

The very first death Ms Moody documented on the map was her stepfather's murder of Stacey-Ann Tracy. She has since documented 1,880 violent deaths - spending about an hour on each one - all in her own time.

Image copyright Sherele Moody Image caption Ms Moody aged 20 - around the time she returned to school to turn her life around

Many violent perpetrators get off lightly, Ms Moody says: ""Sentencing is often abysmal. I just mapped the death of a woman stabbed 40 times by a man. He got out within six months. He's out now, enjoying his life. She's another heart on my femicide map.""

A fresh start

As an adult, Ms Moody asked for her file which had been kept by welfare authorities. It was fat with stories of abuse, neglect and violence. Her personal experience fosters a deep connection to each story: ""I hold every one of these women in my heart.""

The femicide map is part of The Red Heart Campaign, which Ms Moody began in 2015 after reporting an ""overwhelming"" number of domestic violence stories. The campaign was originally a story-telling platform and has since morphed into a recording platform for violence against women and children.

It has been viewed 500,000 times in less than 12 months.

Not everyone has responded well; Ms Moody regularly receives death and rape threats. It's not just online trolling. In September, her horse was killed - its neck had been broken. Before that, her dog was poisoned so badly, it melted away his mouth, tongue and oesophagus.

Police are investigating both incidents, with potential links to four threats from men who live nearby.

""These men want the map removed - because it shows the extent that violence is gendered,"" she says.

More positive recognition came in June when Ms Moody was shortlisted in Australia's top journalism awards, The Walkleys, for her innovative work using Google Maps.

""It's a pretty thankless task, so that recognition was awesome,"" she says.

Reality Check verdict: It's true that in Finland it is not permitted to charge fees for mainstream education - and only 2% of its schools are run by non-governmental bodies. BBC Reality Check was not able to find another example of a country with this rule.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""In some countries, it is not allowed to charge for education in any form... in Finland, for example.""

He was defending his party's decision to vote to integrate private schools into the state sector, if Labour won power.

So, is he right about Finland?

It's true schools there have not been allowed to charge fees for almost 50 years.

The Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture says: ""Charging tuition in basic education is prohibited by the Finnish constitution.""

Until the early 1970s in Finland, most secondary schools were run by private organisations. They were gradually brought under public control over the course of the decade, as part of wide-reaching educational changes, and their governing bodies were abolished.

Schools not operated by the government or local authorities are permitted - and are referred to as ""private schools""- but they are publicly funded and free to pupils, although some charge parents and guardians registration fees.

And there are only 75 of them, making up just 2% of Finnish schools.

This doesn't mean all forms of paid-for education, including private tuition, are banned. But no-one can charge for mainstream schooling that leads to a formal qualification.

Image copyright Getty Images

Finland is rare in the world for having a model like this - we weren't able to find another country with the same rules.

It has been held up as an example because the country scores so highly on the internationally recognised Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) for science, mathematics and reading.

Its 15-year-olds out-perform those in countries that do have private schools - although we can't say the lack of private schools itself is the reason.

The country also performs well for educational equality - that is, pupils have an equal chance of doing well at school regardless of their background.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which runs the Pisa testing, says of Finland: ""No other country has so little variation in outcomes between schools - and the gap within schools between the top and bottom-achieving students is extraordinarily modest as well.

""Finnish schools seem to serve all students well, regardless of family background or socio-economic status.""

A lack of fee-paying schools is not the only difference between the Finnish and other European models of education, though, says Prof Pasi Sahlberg, who has acted as an ambassador for the Finnish model around the world.

Pupils start school at the age of seven after funded early childhood education that focuses on play.

Teachers are paid better than they are in the UK, undergo much longer training courses, and have greater flexibility and control over what they teach.

""The main issue in Finland is not just absence of private schools but having education policy that protects education as a basic human right and public service,"" Prof Sahlberg says.

Finland also has a different demographic mix to the UK, with a far smaller and less diverse population, meaning issues around the funding and organisation of education are not necessarily comparable.

In 2012, Wrightbus was riding high. The company launched a new red double decker bus for London.

A fleet of the New Routemasters had been ordered by the then mayor Boris Johnson - and so became known as Boris Buses.

The new bus even had a starring role on Top Gear, racing with supercars.

It was a triumphant time for the Ballymena business, but now it's been brought low, set to fall into into administration.

Months of rumours

The company's financial stress became public knowledge in July.

It admitted it was working with business advisors Deloitte to find potential investors.

This confirmed months of rumours that had been swirling around Ballymena.

The first sign of problems could be seen in the firm's most recently-published accounts.

Image caption The launch of the new Routemaster was a high point for Wrightbus

The top company in the Wright business, the Cornerstone Group, showed the firm made a loss of £1.7m in 2017.

That compared to a pre-tax profit of almost £11m in 2016.

A note in the accounts said there was continued uncertainty in the UK market with a ""challenging outlook"" for all bus manufacturers.

It also said the business was facing increased material prices due to exchange rates.

That is a reference to the relative weakness of sterling since the Brexit vote, which makes it more expensive to buy components that are priced in euros or dollars.

The company's financial position has deteriorated further since then.

New premises

Wrightbus is a major employer in Ballymena with more than 1,200 employees.

It can trace its history to the years after World War Two, when Robert Wright began making body work for vans and other vehicles.

He was joined by his son William who was instrumental in transforming the business into a major bus builder.

Image caption The Wrightbus factory occupies a huge site in Ballymena

It broke into the UK market and then, under former chief executive Mark Nodder, grew its international presence.

Buses were made for customers in Hong Kong and Singapore. A joint venture was set up in India.

Just two years ago, the company moved onto a huge manufacturing site in Ballymena.

It had been vacated by the cigarette company JTI when they pulled out of the County Antrim town.

It was statement of intent by Wrightbus: ""We're growing and we're here to stay.""

So what's gone wrong?

Demand for new buses in the UK, the key market for Wrightbus, is weak.

Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that in the second quarter of this year new bus and coach registrations are down 30% compared to the same period last year.

That marks the 10th quarter in a row that new registrations have declined.

The bus market is cyclical and Wrights did benefit from a splurge of bus buying earlier this decade as operators updated their fleets to meet new regulatory requirements.

But this down part of the cycle seems particularly pronounced.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For all its publicity, the Boris Bus did not land any export sales for Wrightbus

SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""The current climate of political and economic uncertainty, exacerbated by confusion around differing local authority requirements for clean air zones, is affecting operators' confidence and willingness to invest in the market.""

And for all its publicity the Boris Bus did not land any export sales for Wrightbus.

Transport for London also stopped ordering it in 2016 as it fell out of favour with the the new mayor Sadiq Khan.

Wrightbus's efforts to break into international markets have also not been enough to compensate for weakness in the UK.

In recent years the company has paid out large donations to a religious charity, Green Pastures, which is led by Wrightbus's majority shareholder Jeff Wright.

Image caption Work at the new Green Pastures site appears to have stalled in recent months

Green Pastures received about £15m over six years, helping it to develop a huge church and village complex known as Project Gateway.

Most of this money was paid at a time when the company was making large profits.

Work at the Gateway site appears to have stalled in recent months.

Wrightbus has developed expertise in electric and hydrogen-powered buses and these are expected to be a growing part of the market

So there's still some hope that something can be salvaged from this failure."

2019 Rugby World Cup: England v USA Venue: Kobe Misaki Stadium, Kobe Date: Thursday, 26 September Kick-off: 11:45 BST Coverage: Full commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and online, live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app and live on ITV.

Head coach Eddie Jones is confident his reshuffled England team will cope with their short turnaround as they prepare for Thursday's game against the USA, four days after battling past Tonga.

Only five of the team from Sunday's 35-3 win in their opening World Cup game are keeping their starting places.

""We've done a fair bit of homework for this turnaround,"" Jones told BBC Sport.

""We trialled a four-day turnaround against Japan last autumn, to make sure the players have experience of it.""

George Ford captains the side at 10, with Billy Vunipola selected again at eight and there are World Cup debuts for wingers Ruaridh McConnochie and Joe Cokanasiga plus centre Piers Francis.

Speaking to the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast, Jones added: ""We've looked at selection pretty closely, looked at the players who could back up and who couldn't back up.

""We've tried to work out which players need a rest. Each player is different - some players need a longer time to recover, and some are much better off when they're in form to keep playing.""

England secured a four-try bonus-point win over Tonga in the Sapporo Dome, though they were laboured at times, looking solid in defence but making 14 handling errors across the 80 minutes.

Conditions in the Kobe Misaki stadium are likely to be similar to last weekend, the roof closed specifically for the match here rather than a permanent structure but the humidity inside still noticeable to those used to English autumns.

The home of Top League rugby team Kobelco Steelers as well as football team Vissel Kobe, the current club of former Barcelona and Spain great Andres Iniesta, has a capacity of just over 30,000, with England supporters increasingly visible on the streets of the city over the last few days.

Jones had described facing the USA starting XV as ""like facing 15 Donald Trumps"" in that he expects them to come out ""all guns blazing"" but South African coach Gary Gold, who has also coached London Irish, Newcastle and Bath as well as the Steelers, has opted for the more familiar skills of eight England based players.

Harlequins' Paul Lasike starts at inside-centre, Saracens' Titi Lamositele at tight-head prop and Sale's AJ MacGinty at fly-half.

The 29-year-old MacGinty had an excellent record off the tee for Sale last season, landing 83% of his shots at goal, while full-back Will Hooley is another familiar name to fans of the Premiership, the former England under-20s man having had spells at Northampton Saints and Exeter Chiefs before dropping down to Bedford Blues in the Championship.

England's defence coach John Mitchell coached the Eagles from early 2016 to July 2017, helping them qualify for this World Cup before heading to South Africa to coach the Blue Bulls.

And Jones has been picking his assistant's brains as England look to find a fluency that evaded them in their tournament opener.

Jones said: ""We've spoke to Mitch about the psychology of the team, how they approach their games, the psychology of some of their players.

""They're definitely playing a different sort of game to the one they used to play.

""I coached against the USA a fair bit with Japan and they were a much freer, athletic team.

""They're now a much more pragmatic team, a team that kicks the ball a lot, with a sharp operator in MacGinty at 10, who our boys know pretty well.""

Veteran prop Dan Cole will win his 91st cap at tight-head to go joint-third with Jonny Wilkinson on England men's all-time list, scrum-half Ben Youngs joining him if he comes off the bench as expected.

Cole was left out of Jones' squad earlier this year but is back in his third World Cup, along with Youngs and Courtney Lawes.

Jones said: ""We had a number of conversations, and I'm really proud of how Dan has fought his way back.

""At one stage it was going to be difficult for him to go to the World Cup.

""We gave him a number of things he needed to work on, he went away and worked on them tremendously hard, so it's a great achievement for him and his family.

""To get 91 caps at tight-head for your country - particularly England, which is such a scrummaging powerhouse - gives an indication of his influence in the game.""

Ford is enjoying a run of starts at fly-half, having sat on the bench during the Six Nations as Jones preferred Owen Farrell at 10 with a Manu Tuilagi/Henry Slade combination at centre.

But his two starts in this tournament do not mean he will get the same opportunity when the sterner tests of Argentina and France come in the next two games, according to his coach.

""You should read a lot into it - George is the best 10 for the USA game,"" he said.

Ceramics are everywhere - not just on your table but in your car engine, your mobile phone and your wi-fi. Though Stoke-on-Trent's ceramics industry has suffered a decline, new research and development could be starting to push The Potteries wheel forwards again.

""Most people do not realise what ceramics can be used for,"" said Tony Kinsella, chief executive of development firm Lucideon. ""They are fundamental to our way of life. For instance a mobile phone, a smartphone - up to 600 of its components are ceramic.""

Tens of thousands were employed in the city's pottery industry during its heyday. And if they weren't working in factories, many were also employed in the supply chain - as miners, canal workers, crate packers and mechanics.

Image caption Factory employee starting to paint mugs at the Emma Bridgewater factory. Tableware is still a big deal in the city

Today, the fear is younger generations have no connection to the city's pottery heritage. Dr Natalie Armitage said she has noticed children, who once would have known family members in the industry, have no links to it at all.

She, along with others who work for the British Ceramics Biennial (a contemporary ceramics festival held in the city), are working to make sure this connection does not get lost.

Students are brought to the old Spode factory where they have the chance to learn about the city's heritage, get their hands dirty in clay and discover what the future might hold.

A potted history of the Potteries

There were about 150 factories at any one time during the 19th Century. Firms over the years have included Wedgwood, Spode, Minton, Twyfords Bullers, Doulton, Davenport, George Jones, Ridgway, Cauldon China. Figures for production ran into many millions of units.

Up to 27,000 people were directly employed in the factories, with up to 40,000 employed as a whole when supply industries were taken into consideration.

The skyline was filled with bottle kilns. There were up to 4,000 in the late 19th Century and still about 2,000 in 1950. Now there are 47. The Clean Air Act meant many had to close. Before that, the lung disease potter's asthma was chronic among workers.

The industry went into steep decline between the 1960s and the 1980s. Increased mechanisation, economic recession and outsourcing to the Far East were among the contributory factors.

Some firms are prospering by specialising, keeping up with modern tastes or employing modern production techniques - Steelite, Churchill, Emma Bridgewater and Portmeirion are among these.

""We talk about 3D printing, for example, and how we can use it in different ways. They are always interested in the technology,"" she said.

""There's an interactive space so they can think about the material through sounds, light and mirrors - it's all about changing the perception of the clay and how can we challenge them and get them to think differently.

""I always start by asking if they know how many ceramic components there are to a mobile phone? That always gets everyone thinking.""

Ceramics is an area that is rich in innovation, Dr Armitage said.

""There is the potential for young people to take it on in new and interesting ways. It won't be in the traditional ways, it will be in ways we can't even conceive of yet.""

The 240 scientists at Lucideon, which started life more than 100 years ago as the British Ceramics Research Association, are working in some seriously hi-tech industries.

Here they are developing ways of using sodium-based batteries instead of lithium to reduce environmental damage, looking at the use of ceramics within painkillers to reduce potential dependency on opioids and looking at new ways of applying heat management to engines - again to be more environmentally friendly - in the aerospace industry.

Dr Mark Cresswell, 34, a senior scientist in healthcare at Lucideon, is from Stoke-on-Trent.

""I was aware of the city's history when growing up,"" he said. ""It is taught in school. But I never saw myself as being involved in the industry in that traditional way, but then I didn't know how much we could do in ceramics.

""We are still working with ceramics in the traditional sense but there is so much more to it.""

He thinks there is no reason why Stoke-on-Trent cannot be a force in the future.

""Anyone who works in the industry is aware there is a perception of what ceramics is, so we are speaking to clients all the time to raise awareness of developments.""

'It was very frightening for a 15-year-old'

Pauline Dawson began work aged 15 at Copelands, which later became Spode, after first getting a scholarship to art school to do ceramic painting.

Now 82, she does demonstrations for visitors.

""I didn't know anything about potbanks (pottery factories). It [painting] was a hobby for me, I didn't know I would be able to do it for a living.

""It was a rude awakening. There was 1,000 people worked there. When the bell rang there would be a kind of thundering sound as everyone ran to clock off. It was very frightening for a 15-year-old.

""At first I was on the top floor with Miss Trimble. She was a very nice lady but strict, she had to be with 50 of us.

""We were sat on three-legged stools from 8am to 5.30pm, with a 10-minute break in the morning and an hour for lunch. I thought it was terrible. But I enjoyed the painting and they let me go to art school on Wednesday afternoons.

""Later, I went to the bob shops where where we painted the china. It was piecework and I got a lot of money because I was quite fast. But for every £1 you earned they deducted two shillings to pay for your apprenticeship.

""Eventually, we ended up painting pieces to celebrate Princess Margaret's wedding and we had to swear on the Bible we would not tell anyone what we were doing.

""I do wish it [the industry] would all start up again. I really think we have lost some of the quality we had because it is cheaper to import from abroad.""

While some firms develop and further the use of ceramics, others are looking at how traditional skills can be retained.

Neil Brownsword worked as an apprentice modeller at Wedgwood, in Barlaston, in the late 1980s.

Now he is head of ceramics at Staffordshire University and is keen the old traditions of pottery making, such as copper plate engraving, china flower making and mould making are retained.

""China flower making (where flowers are made and modelled out of clay), it's an incredible craft skill,"" he said. ""It could be made viable again with some creative thinking.

""I think ceramics are becoming fashionable again - the younger generation seem to be turning back to it. We have to use the past as well as the future - use the technological advances.""

And some businesses are prospering.

A lot of the outsourcing is now being brought back in house and anything stamped made in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire or England is still a draw.

""There is still a demand for high quality wares,"" said Miranda Goodby, curator at The Pottteries Museum and Art Gallery.

""Steelite has really capitalised on the hospitality trade, while Emma Bridgewater brought her studios to the city 30 years ago and is a great success. Portmeirion also decamped to the city. Other smaller companies have moved here for the clay and the raw materials, it is still all being done in Stoke-on-Trent.

""The city has got a real buzz. It's all got very hi-tech and it's remarkable.""

While acknowledging the city's heritage, Mr Kinsella and others are determined to drive the area and its industry forwards.

""I feel sad looking at the old buildings and the industrial wasteland in the city,"" he said.

""But we can't make Stoke-on-Trent into a museum - we need to build on its heritage, not live in the past.""

Image copyright Ludiceon Image caption An artist's impression of what an advanced ceramics campus might look like

The next step could be the creation of an advanced ceramic campus where, it is hoped, some of the best universities will be attracted to help develop ever newer uses and techniques.

""We have a possible site, some investors but we need money from the government - about £40m,"" Mr Kinsella said.

""If we can get the support I think we are three years away from making a significant impact in the city.""

Desperate Housewives, Strictly Come Dancing, Lost, Entourage, House and Peppa Pig might not look like they have much in common, but all were launched in the same year - 2004.

It was, safe to say, a significant year for television.

And in addition to the US dramas, TV talent shows and preschool pigs, 2004 also happened to be the year a business show called The Apprentice began.

""Some of this year's [candidates] were five years old when we first started this programme,"" points out Lord Sugar ahead of the show's 15th series. ""Youngsters I speak to every day of the week who stop me in the street love the programme and say they're inspired by it.""

The Apprentice was an immediate success upon its launch in the US and the format was swiftly exported around the world. The UK series, which aired on BBC Two in February 2005, was promoted to BBC One after just two years because it was so popular, and the American version itself even produced a future president.

But while Lord Sugar sees no need to hang up his tie any time soon, the 72-year-old acknowledges it can't go on forever.

""I've got one more series [after this one] that I'm contracted for, which will be the 16th series,"" he says. ""I might do it to 20. Twenty sounds like a round figure.""

Image caption Left-right: 2019 contestants Pamela Laird, Lewis Ellis, Jemelin Artigas, Souleyman Bah and Scarlett Allen-Horton

In 2010, the prize changed from a job in Lord Sugar's company to a £250,000 investment in the winning candidate's business idea. But beyond that, the format has broadly remained the same - 16 candidates, split equally in gender, competing in a series of challenges, with one being fired at the end of each weekly task.

""This raw and painful familiarity must be why The Apprentice continues to be so popular,"" wrote Lucy Sweet in The Big Issue last year. ""Despite never changing an iota of its format, it's still rumbling on.""

Stuart Heritage of The Guardian, meanwhile, has written an article calling for the show to be cancelled every year for the last five series. ""The Apprentice, despite being roughly as enjoyable as getting pelted with sun-hardened donkey dung, inexplicably remains a thing,"" he said last year.

But the stars of the show argue that the format is kept fresh thanks to the new tasks which are added every year, often reflecting changes in technology. ""They're right up to-date, last year it was robotics,"" says Lord Sugar.

""This year, they have to be music agents,"" picks up Baroness Karren Brady, ""and represent an emerging artist and sell his music. There's an electric bike [task], there's a toy... they design a rollercoaster.""

And coming up with the ideas for tasks is harder than it looks, argues Lord Sugar, because ""one has to think of the logistics of a TV programme"".

""In the early days, I thought of one task that I put to the production team of becoming a city trader - buying and selling shares and all that type of stuff. But the truth of the matter is that would make a very boring film. And there are other tasks that would be similar. So I think what we've got at the moment are tasks that have a physical element to them.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sian Gabbidon won the last series with her idea for a swimwear brand

""Having the candidates making stuff in the kitchen is always interesting. One of my favourite tasks is buying the eight items and negotiating. So I do believe the physical side of things is important.""

He adds: ""The production company's team spend months researching and dreaming up these ideas and not only that, but also having to get partners to co-operate. To allow us to come into their venues, to go on their trains, to play with their equipment.

""Don't underestimate the amount of work that goes into that, the paperwork, it takes a lot of organising. The London borough of Islington, for example, doesn't allow you to put a camera on their streets unless you ask permission, all that stuff has got to be cleared.""

Perhaps the most significant change for the show over the last 15 years is the changing landscape of television itself.

In 2004, BBC iPlayer didn't exist. The public largely watched TV programmes live, in their allotted timeslot. As a result, the viewing figures broadcasters received the next morning could make or break a show.

But, Lord Sugar says: ""The figures that people quote of overnights now are all meaningless, because you have to add the iPlayer and the Sky Plus-type user that watches it afterwards, and when you start adding all those together, it comes to 10 million or something like that.""

(He's being slightly generous there - the finale of the last series attracted 7.74 million when all platforms are included, according to ratings body Barb. The original overnight figure was 5.86 million, which meant nearly two million used catch-up services to watch.)

""The problem with our programme is the spoiler,"" Lord Sugar continues. ""Because if you really want to follow it, you don't want to know who got fired the next day [if you haven't seen the episode]. So unlike something like Peaky Blinders for example, which you can pick up the day afterwards, you don't really want to pick up The Apprentice the day afterwards unless you cut yourself off from the world.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lord Sugar says inspiring young people is one of his main motivations

One constant of every series of The Apprentice is how self-assured some the contestants are. In fact, this year's crop appear to have finally broken Claude Littner.

""Normally I'm completely dispassionate,"" he deadpans. ""I watch the candidates day in and day out, and I don't really care. However, this year, I found them incredibly irritating. And as we go through, you'll be irritated as well, I guarantee it.""

From the opening seconds of this series, you can see what he means. ""Millions isn't enough for me, I need billions for the lifestyle I want,"" claims one candidate. ""Cut me, and I'll bleed ambition,"" says another.

""We've got a pillow salesman, a librarian, a baker, a sports agent,"" says Baroness Brady of this year's crop of hopefuls. ""There's no mould of a business person now, it's anybody with any kind of background or experience.""

Lord Sugar agrees: ""They are a different group of people, and that's what makes the programme each year, different characters from all walks of life.""

The Apprentice begins on Wednesday 2 October at 21:00 BST on BBC One."

In the middle of making her new album, Brittany Howard decided to record the air conditioner.

Holding a microphone to ceiling, she captured the unit's electromagnetic pulse, turned it into a tape loop, then transposed it onto a keyboard.

""In the end, I think we were overly ambitious,"" she reflects. ""Because it turned out to be terrible.""

The experiment may have been scrapped, but it illustrates the sense of freedom Howard felt as she made her first solo album.

""I actually made some music the way I hear it,"" she says. ""No-one tells me they don't like it, no-one says they don't like this bass part, or this arrangement's too crazy. It was just up to me to make my own mistakes.""

Image caption The singer was raised on a junk-yard in rural Alabama, and was a postal worker before Alabama Shakes hit the big time

Howard was last seen as the frontwoman of Alabama Shakes, the roots-rock revivalists who won an armful of Grammys for their debut album, Boys & Girls, and its 2015 follow-up, Sound & Colour.

But by the time they finished their most recent tour, in 2017, the singer-songwriter felt drained and exhausted. Facing 30, she was also considering what another decade in the band might look like.

A lightbulb flickered into life during a long drive through the plains of Oklahoma with her wife, musician Jesse Lafser.

""I thought, 'What do I want for the rest of my career?' And I said, 'Well, it'd be cool if I did something on my own'.

""I just felt unwilling to give things away any more.""

Once she decided to go it alone, the band were the first people she called.

""We sat in a circle and we just talked about it. It was bittersweet, for sure, because we've grown up together, we've changed our lives together - but I think everyone walked away from the room knowing that it wasn't necessarily so much an ending as it was like, 'OK, here's a new beginning'.""

'Banging my head'

Howard set about writing her debut solo album in Topanga, California, in the middle of a heatwave - playing all the instruments herself in a ""sweaty greenhouse"" no bigger than a double bed.

""Topanga is a really beautiful mountain area with flowers and bees and birds - but I was just absolutely miserable when I first got there, banging my head against the wall going, 'I can't think of any new songs. I can't think of anything, I can't do anything.'

""But once I stopped trying, the songs came, and they came really complete. I could just hear all the parts.""

Freed from the constraints of working with a band, she indulged her wildest musical ideas - mixing decades worth of P-Funk, psychedelic blues, hard rock, Southern soul and gospel with free-wheeling imagination.

In lesser hands it would be a mess, but Howard has a firm grip on song structure, never allowing musical complexity to get in the way of a melody; while her vocals, always the highlight of Alabama Shakes' albums, are typically soulful and nuanced.

The emotional territory she covers is just as broad and uncompromising.

Georgia is an undulating R&B ballad about falling in love with an older woman; while He Loves Me discusses her relationship with God (""I don't go to church any more/I know He still loves me"") over a lurching Benny & The Jets rhythm.

'There's a racial line'

Her most striking lyrics come on Goat Head, as she discusses growing up as the child of a poor, interracial couple in rural Alabama.

""When I was born - or rather when my sister was born in 1984 - that was like the first wave of mixed babies, little brown babies,"" she says.

""My mama would go around town, pushing my sister and I in a cart to the grocery store, and people would actually come up to her and lecture her. They would say, 'Do you know what you've done?'""

In the song, she recalls an incident that happened when she was a baby, but was told about later, where ""someone cut off a goat's head, and they put it in the back of my dad's car and slashed his tyres, and smeared blood all over his car"".

""It's always been a part of me, that story,"" says Howard. ""Because Athens was a beautiful, peaceful country place, where people are neighbours and we really care about each other. But there's a racial line, or there was at least, and that's why I wanted to write that song. Just to explain where I was coming from.""

She recalls happier childhood experiences on Stay High - an ode to her father, and the joyous nights of games and music he'd instigate when he got home from the ""grind and hustle"" of his day job.

""My family didn't have a lot of money, so music was a free activity,"" she says. ""We could dance or we could sing with it, or we could play on buckets with it.""

Her older sister Jaime was her role model, playmate and idol, she recalls. More importantly, she inspired her to play piano.

""She learned by ear and she'd try to play Beethoven pieces and things like that. And I would just sit in this blue chair in my grandmother's living room, and I would turn round and round and round and listen to her play, and I'd go, 'Do it again, do it again'. We could sit with that piano for hours and make it so entertaining.""

But Howard's world was torn apart when Jaime died of retinoblastoma, a rare of form of eye cancer, when she was just 13.

""My whole family was devastated,"" she says. ""We had prayed and she didn't make it. It was like, 'How could God do this to a child? How could he do this to our family?'""

They stopped going to church. Howard's parents divorced. And, because the family house had burned down during Jaime's illness, the singer lost almost every trace of her sister.

Although her new album isn't about Jaime, it carries her name, ""so it would no longer bring me sadness,"" Howard says.

""She was my first teacher. She was the one who taught me to love music, and who taught me to be imaginative and creative. She left me with all those things I hold near and dear to me, so it only felt appropriate to put her name on there - because I feel like I didn't do it alone.""

Image copyright Brantley Gutierrez Image caption ""I got bills like everybody else,"" says the star

Just as Jaime was crucial to her musical education, Howard had help in the studio as she fleshed out her album - with jazz drummer Nate Smith, keyboardist Robert Glasper and Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell turning her demos into a full-band affair.

""I'd tell them, 'I want you to stick to the song, but I want you to do it your way. Do what moves you'. And because they're so emotive, it made the whole process very simple and wonderful.""

The adventurous approach didn't stop with the air conditioner - Smith plays the drums with chopsticks on Stay High - and Howard rails against the modern trend for auto-tuned technical perfection.

""You know, you don't need the best gear, the most expensive stuff, to make something wonderful. In fact, it's a lot more fun, being creative with things that are kind of worthless junk,"" she says.

The record, which was released last Friday, has already received glowing reviews. Rolling Stone magazine called it ""strikingly bold"" while Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine said repeated listens would prove ""profound and nourishing"".

For Howard, who finished the album last year, it's just a relief to finally get it out there.

""I've been like a chicken with a giant egg,"" she laughs. ""I've been sitting on this forever.""

As a new generation of students settle into university life, many will be prepared for years of hard work - not just studying, but part-time jobs. And for some, the employment can be as educational as the courses.

Work experience certainly helped Hira Hanif overcome a rocky start to start a career that made her and her parents proud. The 29-year-old moved to the UK from Pakistan aged 12, and struggled with her English at school. She got E, F and G grades in her GCSEs, and she failed her A-levels, twice.

She didn't have the grades she needed to get to university - and instead had to spend two years sitting a vocational BTEC qualification first. Not wanting to be overburdened with debt, she lived at home and took out minimal government loans. She worked as a sales lead at the shoe shop Aldo - a more demanding role than most student jobs. Partying took a back seat.

Work experience is an integral part of legal training, but her experience was mixed. In her law degree, she says she didn't learn much. ""I was given a book and told to sit at the back of the court and take notes. I was never fully involved [and they never] explained anything, so I never really enjoyed it.""

The next level of her studies, the Bar Professional Training Course, was much more informative, she says.

""I understood more of what was happening in court, and I appreciated my work placements more,"" she says. ""I took every opportunity that I could to sit in court.""

Hira completed her law studies this summer and now works as an advocate in Bristol.

""When I left school I made a pact that to say thank you for my parents' hard work and their sacrifice, I am going to do something that will make them proud of me,"" she says. ""I failed so many times and every time they would say, 'That's ok, let's try again'. And that's what got me where I am.""

Careers advice

Work experience can sometimes be a good way to find out more about working life, decide on future careers or study options, and develop skills and employability.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Time to start looking for a job - or have you been working for years already?

""Our research has shown that 90% of students are motivated by future employment when working whilst studying,"" says Eva Crossan Jory, vice president, welfare, of the National Union of Students.

Universities and colleges themselves can often help with access to part-time employment, support in moving into work after graduation and work experience, she adds. The careers advice service is the place to start.

Entrepreneurial skills

Few things will impress a potential employer more than a student who sets up their own business - and for many students, that's a career goal in its own right.

""Students are generally more entrepreneurial than 10 years ago - the accessibility provided by modern technology means students have the opportunity to show their entrepreneurial skills more freely and easily,"" says Louise Farrar, PwC's head of student recruitment.

Image copyright Hasan Sukkar Image caption Hasan Sukkar sold hoodies and pillows at university

For example Hasan Sukkar, 21, funded his degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Exeter by selling hoodies and pillows online.

""The world of e-commerce is constantly evolving with new tools, technologies and business models that are challenging the status quo. Setting up an e-commerce business is easier than ever before,"" he said.

Hasan also combined his business and full-time studying with a placement year at oil giant ExxonMobil.

""It helped me in deciding what career I want to have, and it greatly increased my chances of getting accepted into very competitive graduate schemes,"" he said.

After graduating, Hasan was accepted onto the New Entrepreneurs Foundation Fast Track Programme. He is now working as a data scientist.

""A lot of people go to university not knowing what they are trying to achieve and then leave with tens of thousands of pounds in debt and limited career prospects,"" he said.

""To avoid this, my biggest three suggestions would be to gain relevant work experience from early on in your degree, push yourself outside your zone of comfort and try varied pursuits until you find out what you enjoy the most, and most importantly surround yourself with smart people who will help and support you in becoming the best version of yourself.""

In 2018, a Santander report found that a quarter of students run, or plan to run their own company. Student enterprises collectively generate revenues of £1bn a year, and a third plan to turn their business into a career when they graduate. And some universities offer mentorship and support programmes to help budding campus entrepreneurs.

Anglia Ruskin University, for example, runs and academy which offers seminars, networking events, grants, and pitching clinics for students.

It also holds an annual competition, where students can develop a business plan and pitch for funding.

The scheme allowed Chiyedza Heri to pitch her own business. She was studying Biomedical Science.

""My parents had encouraged me to take the sciences route. Initiatives [like this one] showed me that if other students like me, not studying business, can try out ideas, what's stopping me?"" she says.

Chiyedza pitched several ideas, including a research company that would identify herbs used in Zimbabwean medicine and a herbal medicine company. In the end she settled on selling African herbal tea.

Although she didn't win the prize money, she had a business plan and valuable experience to use when starting her own company.

""Initially I really focused on the health benefits and the bells and whistles,"" she says. ""Through feedback and mentoring I learnt to tailor a pitch to the audience.""

""Students now appreciate that it doesn't matter what discipline they are studying - they all have the chance of being entrepreneurial. And setting up their own business is no longer a plan, for many it is their main aim,"" says Marcia Baldry, enterprise support manager at the academy.

Five top tips on how to get work experience at university

It's important to get the balance right - most universities recommend less than 15 hours a week, so make sure your work experience is flexible, and scheduled around your studies.

Speak to your university or college for advice about work experience while you study - possibly on-campus in the library, at open days, or with the students' union.

If you have definite career plans, you may be able to find work experience that is directly relevant. Otherwise, you can gain a variety of skills with a temporary job.

Getting a part-time job can improve your confidence, build your skills to increase your employability, and offers the opportunity to meet new people. Retail, admin, restaurants, bars, telesales, or market research are all popular choices.

Finding opportunities isn't always easy, so it's good to start thinking about work experience early. You can search for current roles online or contact local businesses directly.

When 19-year-old Khadiza Akter Khushi led hundreds of people to the home of her soon-to-be husband, she didn't do it for her guests.

She did it for all the Bangladeshi women she hoped would follow in her footsteps.

The walk is thought to be a first in a country where, for centuries, the opposite has happened: men have walked to the homes of their brides on their wedding day.

""If boys can bring girls to marriage, why can't girls?"" she asked BBC Bengali in the days after her wedding to Tariqul Islam had gone viral.

But it has both inspired and horrified. One man suggested the couple and their families should be beaten with slippers.

For Khadiza and her husband it was, quite simply, the right thing to do.

""Tradition is not the issue here,"" she told the BBC. ""It is a matter of women's rights. Today, if a girl goes to marry a boy, then no one is harmed.

""Instead, abuse of women will decrease, women will get their dignity. No one will be less than the other.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption They hope they will be the first of many

The couple were aware of the resistance to the marriage, held in a rural region next to the border with India last Saturday. Even members of their own families were not initially keen.

But Tariqul, 27, says they eventually came around. After all, they were doing nothing wrong.

""Many marry in court, many marry in the mosque. We were married according to religion,"" the newly-wed explained.

""There was a Kazi [marriage register], witnesses. That's how the marriage was registered. That's the formality of marriage. That's exactly what we did.

""It doesn't matter what people think, what they say. Some people will think differently, everybody is entitled to their opinion.""

An ancient tradition turned on its head

by Sanjana Chowdhury, BBC Bengali

According to tradition here, the groom and his relatives go to the house of the bride, where the marriage and celebrations will take place, before the bride says goodbye to her family and goes to her husband's house.

It has happened like this since ancient times.

But in Meherpur, a district in western Bangladesh, something unique has taken place: here, the bride came with her family to the groom's house to marry, and afterwards the groom moved to the wife's home.

The significance of this cannot be understated: for many men, this would be considered humiliating. Some people would even call it outrageous.

This wouldn't even happen in the cities of Bangladesh, let alone a small village. This couple have started out their married life showing great courage.

Despite their confidence, it was a brave decision. Bangladesh has made great strides towards equality in recent years, and is the highest ranked country in South Asia when it comes to gender equality, according to the World Economic Forum.

But serious issues remain. The death of Nusrat Jahan Rafi - who, at 19, was the same age as the bride - made headlines around the world. She was allegedly burned alive after filing a complaint for sexual harassment against her headmaster.

Meanwhile, the United Nations says around two-thirds of women who marry will experience violence at the hands of their partners, with half reporting assaults in the last year.

And while the position of women is improving in areas like education, marriage laws in the Muslim-majority country have been criticised by women's rights groups as restrictive and discriminatory.

It was only last month that the high court ruled that women would no longer be required to declare whether or not they were virgins on marriage registration forms. Men did not have to make any such declaration.

Tariqul and Khadija are hopeful their wedding will be another step towards true gender equality.

""I am sure our marriage will send a message that a woman can do whatever a man can,"" Tariqul told news agency AFP.

And even if not, they are more than happy with their choice.

""We had a lot of fun in the wedding,"" Khadiza said."

There's a new political controversy in the US - involving Donald Trump, foreign nationals, questions about legal and ethical behaviour, and allegations against a political rival - and it's all led to an impeachment inquiry into the US president.

The story can be difficult to follow, so here are some answers to the most pressing questions.

Why is this important?

Mr Trump's critics accuse him of using the powers of the presidency to bully Ukraine into digging up damaging information on a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden.

Mr Trump and his supporters allege the former vice-president abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter.

Mr Biden is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to take on Mr Trump next year.

In other words, it is nothing less than the White House at stake.

Where does this row stem from?

Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a phone conversation on 25 July this year.

A rough transcript of the call shows that the US president pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice-President Biden and his son, who was a board member for a company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.

The call came after the Trump administration had delayed releasing US military funds to Ukraine until mid-September.

Mr Trump also referenced the 2016 hacking of the Democratic email server in the call to Mr Zelensky, and seemed to imply that the server still exists somewhere in Ukraine.

The US president says he has done nothing wrong, calling the impeachment proceedings a ""joke"".

He has accused Democrats of themselves threatening Mr Zelensky by withholding their votes on US laws affecting Ukraine, and says the controversy was created in order to distract from Mr Trump's meetings at the United Nations.

What are other US politicians saying?

Congressional Democrats say the phone call - raised by a whistleblower in a formal complaint - is proof Mr Trump brought improper pressure on a foreign power for personal gain.

Democrats say the president wanted the Ukrainians to start the investigation into corruption because this could sully the reputation of Hunter and his father.

Several Republicans came forward after the partial transcript of the call was released to defend Mr Trump. This shows the partisan nature of the controversy, which has - like much else in Washington - been divided by party politics.

However, at least one Republican, Mitt Romney, a US senator from Utah, said he would like to know more.

Skip Twitter post by @MittRomney If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019 Report

What was in the whistleblower's complaint?

We still don't know.

Initial reports painted the complaint as a troubling account of the president's dealings with a foreign leader.

For days after details of the complaint emerged the Trump administration refused to share it but amid growing pressure it changed tack.

President Trump has now pledged transparency and the release of the phone transcript formed part of this - the president said it would show the call was ""totally appropriate"".

The transcript released though was not a full, verbatim account, but rather notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower""

The complaint itself was released to the House and Senate Intelligence committees on Wednesday and reports suggest that negotiations are under way to allow the still unknown whistleblower to testify.

Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, is scheduled to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.

Did the president do something illegal?

The most damning allegation is that the president pressured a foreign leader for damaging information about a political opponent while holding out the prospect of US military aid.

Is that illegal? We do have some very recent precedent.

It certainly recalls the recently concluded two-year Robert Mueller investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian election-meddling in 2016.

The special counsel's report detailed multiple contacts between the campaign and Russian nationals, including the June 2016 meeting between top campaign officials such as Donald Trump Jr and several Russians with ties to the Kremlin.

There has been some debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constitutes a campaign finance violation, but Mr Mueller declined to file charges.

Mr Trump's Ukrainian call could also potentially run afoul of federal bribery statutes. The special counsel concluded that Justice Department policy guidelines prohibit a sitting president from being indicted, however, so even if Mr Trump did commit some kind of crime with his actions, he's safe at the moment from criminal prosecution.

With this in mind, a more relevant question might be …

Did Mr Trump commit an impeachable offence?

The constitutional process for handling a president who committed illegal and-or unethical acts is impeachment by a majority of the House of Representatives and conviction and removal by a two-thirds majority of the US Senate.

The US constitution outlines the grounds for impeachment as ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"". When it comes down to it, an ""impeachable offense"" is whatever a majority of the House says it is.

Ever since the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, the drumbeat for impeachment among Democrats - who hold a comfortable majority in the House - has been steadily increasing. Initially, however, the House Democratic leadership was loath to push ahead with a formal investigation that could lead to an impeachment vote.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had suggested that such a move could damage the electoral prospects of Democrats in moderate congressional districts and would in the end be meaningless because the Republicans who hold the majority in the Senate would never vote to remove the president.

But then on Tuesday, Ms Pelosi announced that Democrats were opening a formal impeachment inquiry.

She said the president had committed ""a violation of the law"", and called his actions ""a breach of his constitutional responsibilities"". She said he ""must be held accountable"".

Is there anything to these allegations about Joe Biden and his son?

The allegations against the Bidens pushed by Mr Trump and his lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, centre on the then-vice-president's successful effort to force out top Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016.

Mr Shokin's office was responsible for investigations into a Ukrainian gas company, Burisima Holdings, which at the time was paying Hunter Biden, Mr Biden's son, as much as $50,000 a month to serve on its board of directors.

Mr Trump, Mr Giuliani and others allege that the vice-president's pressure, which included the threat to withhold $1bn in US loan guarantees to the country, was an effort to protect his son and his company from potentially criminal exposure.

Image copyright Pool/Getty Images Image caption Former President Barack Obama sits with former Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010

No evidence has so far been produced to indicate that Joe Biden either acted corruptly or was influenced by his son's work in Ukraine.

However, critics believe at the very least the Biden family's ties to Ukraine raise the perception of a possible conflict of interest.

Cutting against these allegations is the fact that Mr Biden was not the only public official - in the US, among EU countries and in Ukraine - calling for Mr Shokin's removal.

And as the New York Times recently noted, the Ukrainian prosecutor was not ""aggressively pursuing"" investigations into Burisima at the time, but was accused of using the threat of prosecution to solicit bribes from company leaders.

In addition, Mr Shokin's replacement, Yuriy Lutsenko, continued to investigate Burisima for 10 months before ending all legal proceedings.

West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini took responsibility as his side were bundled out of the Carabao Cup in humiliating fashion by League One Oxford United.

The Hammers arrived at the Kassam Stadium on the back of an outstanding win over Manchester United to reach the heights of fifth in the Premier League, but Karl Robinson's side superbly outplayed and over-powered their illustrious opponents, who ended a complete shambles.

Oxford, currently 12th in League One, were high on confidence after a record-breaking 6-0 win at Lincoln City at the weekend and this was a famous and richly merited triumph.

""The whole team didn't play well. Not only did we concede four goals, but we didn't create too many chances,"" Pellegrini said.

""We missed too many passes from the beginning and the responsibility is first on me because I picked the players, and second on the team that didn't compete.

""It's easy to say that we played very badly, but Oxford did everything they needed to win this game. They played with a lot of motivation, with desire and we didn't play well.""

Both sides fielded much-changed sides and the only surprise was West Ham actually survived for so long before conceding after 55 minutes when Oxford central defender Elliott Moore shot across Roberto.

Oxford, who missed clear chances in the first half through Cameron Brannagan and Anthony Forde, almost increased their lead immediately as Roberto saved brilliantly from Jamie Mackie.

But there was no escape for West Ham as substitute Matty Taylor turned in Mark Sykes' cross with 19 minutes left.

Substitute Tariqe Fosu, a hat-trick hero at Lincoln City, raced clear from the halfway line to score with great composure after 84 minutes to extinguish any hopes of a West Ham comeback.

The agony was not over yet for West Ham boss Pellegrini and his abject side as Shandon Baptiste deservedly capped a man-of-the-match showing with a classy fourth.

Oxford host fellow League One side Sunderland, who won 1-0 at Sheffield United, in the fourth round in the week commencing 28 October.

""Looking at the scoreboard - 4-0 against West Ham and a very strong West Ham - this will probably go down as one of the biggest results at the Kassam in recent years,"" Oxford boss Robinson said.

Humiliation for West Ham and Pellegrini

The EFL Cup represented a realistic opportunity for West Ham to win a trophy, but Pellegrini risked this shock by making nine changes, leaving out danger men Sebastien Haller and Felipe Anderson.

He paid the price as the Hammers produced a desperate display, much to the annoyance of the fans who packed one corner of this three-sided stadium.

West Ham were lethargic, off the pace and apparently complacent as they were hustled out of their stride as the track-suited Pellegrini failed to inspire his team.

He kept Haller back until they were a goal down but by then the momentum was flowing inexorably in the direction of Oxford, who should have inflicted even heavier punishment as they ran riot towards the end.

Jack Wilshere wasted an opportunity to stake a claim as he was over-run by the energy of Baptiste. Wilshere looked a spent force in contrast.

It was reminiscent of West Ham's loss at League One AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup fourth round last season as they lacked heart and stomach for the fight, surrendering without suggesting for one moment they would get back into this game once Oxford went ahead.

West Ham have shown signs of stability and improvement in the Premier League, and this was an altered line-up, but their performance was inexcusable and all the plaudits must go to the underdogs.

""I thought it was a poor performance from everyone,"" said Hammers captain Zabaleta.

""We feel sorry about the performance tonight and sorry to the away fans who came to the game. It was just a bad night.""

Oxford's glory night

This competition gave Oxford the greatest day in their history when they beat QPR at Wembley in 1986 - and this is a night that will also live long in the memory of the jubilant fans.

West Ham made changes but, for context, Oxford manager Robinson also made six changes and his team dealt much better with those alterations.

Oxford were in command from the first whistle, sensing immediately that West Ham were not in the right frame of mind to face a lower league opponent determined to inflict a shock.

Robinson may have feared the first-half misses from Brannagan and Forde may haunt them, but they won at a canter and it would not have been unfair had they enjoyed an even greater victory margin.

Oxford have now scored 10 goals without reply in their past two games and this scoreline was a more than accurate reflection of the gulf between the two sides.

Baptiste was outstanding in midfield, the veteran Mackie was a threat throughout and it is huge credit to Robinson and his players that they never took a backward step once Moore put them ahead 10 minutes after the break.

Oxford continued to be bold and go in search of goals, and the celebrations on and off the pitch at the final whistle were fully deserved.

This was a night of shame for West Ham, but it would be an insult and injustice to downgrade the quality of Oxford's performance that brought this outstanding victory.

""We had the belief in ourselves that we could get a result,"" Robinson said. ""I'm over the moon for the fans and the players.

""It's about the players, about the fans and about the community of Oxfordshire and the big thing for me now is the people who came here for the first time in a long time, that they buy a ticket and come on Saturday [for the league game against Gillingham]."""

Manchester United needed penalties to beat neighbours Rochdale in the Carabao Cup third round on a tense night at Old Trafford.

Mason Greenwood put United ahead with a low strike but 16-year-old Luke Matheson smashed home a famous equaliser 14 minutes from time for League One Rochdale to force penalties.

Jimmy Keohane was the only player who failed to score in the shootout, with Sergio Romero saving his effort and United scoring all five efforts.

While the hosts, who had 31 shots during the 90 minutes, left the pitch rather sheepishly, Rochdale earned a standing ovation from the 5,500 travelling supporters.

United travel to Chelsea in the fourth round in the week commencing 28 October.

Last month, the biggest date in Matheson's diary was to collect his GCSE results from Trinity C of E High School in Fallowfield. He got 10 in all, including an 8 in PE, more than enough to allow him to enrol for the A-Level courses he feels will be beneficial if his football career does not work out.

School is less than five miles from the world famous arena Matheson shook to its core with the first goal of his 14-match professional career.

United thought they had freed themselves from Rochdale's grasp through Greenwood's low drive.

But a team who conceded six at Peterborough and have been beaten by Manchester City Under-21s this season proved more difficult to get rid of than United imagined.

Eight minutes after Greenwood's goal, Matheson drove a volley into the ground after advancing into the box and sent it bouncing over Romero.

Matheson, who became the youngest player in Rochdale's history when he made his first-team debut 12 months ago, was mobbed by ecstatic team-mates.

United's efforts to regain the lead met with the same disappointment felt when Paul Pogba headed their best chance over in the first half and Marcos Rojo sent three long-range shots way off target.

Yet even the relief at a win came with a sting for manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, whose ailing side face a tougher test in the next round.

Too many players failing to deliver

This has not been an easy few days for United. Beaten at West Ham on Sunday with a performance condemned on TV by former skipper Roy Keane and former manager Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer is a man under pressure.

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward tried to help on Tuesday when, instead of concentrating of record financial turnover of £627m, he spoke of a club ""resolute"" in their desire to return to former glories.

In addition, Woodward called for Solskjaer to be afforded some patience by a demanding supporter base.

It is understood these sentiments have been reinforced even more forcefully in private.

Senior figures are adamant the club is on a long-term path and will not be deflected from it no matter what short-term difficulties may arise - and there is an acknowledgement some tough days probably lay ahead before the current campaign is done.

This is a laudable stance to take, in keeping with a club that had two managers - Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson - who were in charge for well over 20 years.

However, in an era where Newcastle can demand £50m for a 21-year-old midfielder with barely any first-team experience in Sean Longstaff and simply end negotiations when United baulked at the fee, the Old Trafford rebuilding job is going to be long and expensive and comes with absolutely no guarantee of success.

Solskjaer is not making a particularly convincing job of making fans believe better times are on the horizon.

There were positives against Rochdale but they were mainly through the youth of Greenwood, scoring for the second time this season, and 19-year-old defender Brandon Williams, who was introduced for his debut at half-time.

But too many experienced players are failing to deliver and Monday's Premier League encounter with Arsenal does not promise much in the way of a change in fortune.

'Learning curve for United'

Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: ""Go 1-0 up, get the second. That is a learning curve. At this club you don't just sit back and think one is enough.

""Mason Greenwood has two great feet. He's a nightmare for defenders; he can go both ways. He is young. We will allow him to grow slowly but surely.

""The players wanted to take the penalties. I am very pleased with the confidence. [We are] better in penalty shootouts than in proper games.""

On the fourth-round tie with Chelsea: ""If you want to win, you have to beat the best. It slots nicely into a couple of weeks with loads of travelling. We are going to relish it."""

MPs have returned to Parliament a day after the Supreme Court ruled that the decision to suspend sittings for five weeks was unlawful.

On Tuesday we answered your questions on the ruling and now we are looking at queries received from readers about what happens now that the House of Commons is back in session.

Why does the PM insist the UK will leave the EU on 31 October given that a no-deal is illegal? - Michael

While Parliament has passed a law that tries to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, it can't make such an outcome illegal.

That's because a no-deal Brexit is the legal default outcome - unless a deal is passed or Brexit is cancelled altogether.

Under the law passed by MPs, Mr Johnson is required to request a three-month Brexit delay by 19 October. The only exceptions are if MPs vote for no deal or pass a deal beforehand.

However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also insists the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"".

So, assuming the government is required to seek an extension, it's currently unclear how Mr Johnson will meet his Brexit pledge while complying with the law at the same time.

With Parliament back in session, will MPs sit through the Conservative Party conference? - Luke

MPs normally vote to have a recess during the traditional autumn party conference period. When Parliament is in recess, no sittings take place.

But because the government decided to prorogue Parliament, no such recess vote took place.

Now that Parliament has resumed, sittings will be scheduled to take place on the final three days of the Conservative Party conference which runs from 29 September to 2 October.

That means Conservative MPs may have to choose between attending the Manchester conference and sitting in Westminster.

To avoid this, the government may decide to ask MPs to agree to a short recess. But even if a recess vote was introduced, there is no guarantee the government would win.

Could the EU volunteer a Brexit extension to the UK? - Greg

Yes. In theory, the EU could offer a Brexit extension without the UK having to request one first, as long as the other 27 member countries agreed.

However, any offer from the EU wouldn't automatically change the UK's exit date.

That's because Parliament also has to amend the legislation which sets the day of the UK's departure in stone. This is what happened when the original exit day was moved from 29 March - after MPs debated and voted on the issue.

Can opposition parties now form an alternative government? - Simon

It is possible a change of government could happen without an election.

That's because the prime minister is ultimately the person who commands the ""confidence"" of the House of Commons.

So if another individual, such as Jeremy Corbyn, can show they have the support of a majority of MPs, it is possible that an alternative government could form.

This could be achieved through a formal motion of no confidence. If the opposition propose such a vote, the government would be expected to make time for it as soon as practically possible.

If a simple majority of MPs vote in favour, then the government falls. Opposition parties then have 14 days to try to form an alternative government. If this fails to happen, or the government fails to regain the confidence of the Commons, then a general election is automatically triggered.

Can the Queen now question the 'advice' given to her by the PM?

In recent decades the Queen's role with regards to parliamentary matters has been more symbolic and ceremonial than anything else.

There has been an unwritten rule for many years that nothing would ever be done to put her in a position where she could be accused of having a political role.

Image copyright Reuters

The prorogation of Parliament happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it and in reality, she would have had no choice other than to grant Mr Johnson's request to do this.

After the Scottish Court of Session case into the suspension, a Palace source told the BBC: ""The Queen acts and acted on the advice of her ministers.""

What happens if the PM resigns shortly before 11pm on 31 October and doesn't nominate a successor?

When a prime minister stands down they go to Buckingham Palace to offer the Queen their resignation. If it is not obvious who might succeed them, the outgoing PM would usually recommend someone who can command the ""confidence"" of the House of Commons.

That's because the Queen must have a prime minister at all times.

When a party in government has a majority, the successor is usually obvious. The position will go to their successor as party leader.

But there are no firm rules about what would happen under a minority government if a prime minister refuses to nominate a successor or was incapacitated in some way.

Under such a scenario, it's likely that the Queen would have to seek other advice, possibly from the cabinet. But she may have to choose the appointee herself, according to Catherine Haddon from the Institute of Government.

In such a scenario the Queen would probably have two options - someone recommended by the existing cabinet, or opting for the Leader of the Opposition, whose role, historically, has been to act as a government-in-waiting in case of such circumstances, says Ms Haddon.

Can anyone take a case to the Supreme Court or does it have to be someone wealthy? - Ann

The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for all UK civil cases, and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

It does not consider cases brought by individuals, only ones from lower courts when a relevant order has been made.

The Supreme Court concentrates on cases of the greatest public and constitutional importance."

The Senate passed S.J. Res. 54, 54-41, which would terminate President Trump’s national emergency declaration on the southern border. The resolution was created by Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and co-sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Susan Collins (R-ME).

Sen. Collins said the bill is not about “whether you’re for or against a border wall.” The Maine senator, who is up for a tough reelection fight in 2020, claimed that she has “consistently supported” funding for physical barriers on the southern border.

However, Congress has failed to provide significant funding to help secure America’s southern border by building a border wall. With Congress’ failure to provide funding, President Trump declared a national emergency to build the border wall, which diverted military funding so that the president can build a wall along the southern border.

The Republicans that voted for the resolution to end the national emergency to build a border wall are Sens. Collins, Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rob Portman (R-OH).

The vote arises as the Pentagon announced in September that they will delay or suspend 127 military construction projects so that $3.6 billion can be diverted to help secure America’s southern border.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that many Republicans might decide to vote with Democrats because local military bases’ funds have been diverted towards funding the wall.

“I don’t think anyone, no matter what state they are from, will want to see money being taken away from their military installations, [which is] very much needed,” Schumer said Tuesday.

Congressional Democrats failed to pass the resolution to override Trump’s national emergency in March, which failed to override the president’s veto.

The toy company introduced a line of 29 dolls called “Creatable World,” which comes in different kits with hair, clothing, and other accessory options depending on whether the kit is more masculine or feminine. The dolls come in at a suggested retail price of $30.

“Toys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,” Kim Culmone, senior vice president of Mattel Fashion Doll Design, said in a statement. “Through research, we heard that kids don’t want their toys dictated by gender norms.”

When the company rolled out the dolls, Mattel toned down typically masculine and feminine features and featured kits addressed with the pronoun “they” and the slogan “A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in.”

Mattel said the dolls are available at big-box retailers such as Target, Walmart, and Amazon."

“The battle lines are drawn,” a senior House GOP aide directly involved in the effort to expose Democrats on the floor with recorded votes told Breitbart News on Wednesday evening. “We now know where every member of the House is on impeachment. And we know it is purely partisan.”

While the procedures are slightly D.C. insider-sounding, this vote, forced by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, represents the first time the lower Chamber of Congress has officially gone on record with regard to the impeachment of Trump, and it forces vulnerable Democrats who were waffling on whether to publicly back removal of the president from office by force on the record in support of the radical leftist wing of the party.

“Democrats were caught off guard by this,” the GOP aide said. “They were not ready to go on the record. ”

Pelosi announced on Tuesday late afternoon that the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry of the president, a move she made via press conference. Traditionally, when considering impeachment of an executive branch official, up to and including the president of the United States, the House of Representatives will vote to formally open proceedings. It has done this three times in recent history.

But, because Pelosi attempted to shield vulnerable Democrat members from battleground districts, she did not–as House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) has pointed out repeatedly–hold a formal vote to open the proceedings officially.

There are no real impeachment proceedings ongoing because the House hasn’t voted to authorize them—and the speaker can’t launch an inquiry by fiat. The House should pass legislation that helps the American people instead of trying to sell an impeachment fiction to the public. pic.twitter.com/V0uS6kWkB8 — Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 25, 2019

Speaker Pelosi’s decree changes absolutely nothing. As I have been telling Chairman Nadler for weeks, merely claiming the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry doesn’t make it so. Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry. — Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 24, 2019

So, on Wednesday, McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, drafted a resolution formally condemning the way in which Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry.

The text of the resolution that McCarthy introduced is as follows:

Whereas at a press conference on September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stated: “Therefore today, I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” Whereas House Practice states that: “Under the modern practice, an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges against the officer in question.” Whereas in the past 25 years, the House of Representatives has moved forward with impeachment against a federal officer three times, each initiated by an impeachment inquiry resolution approved by the full House, not by a unilateral decree of the Speaker. Whereas on May 12, 2009, the House approved H. Res. 424, authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire whether the House should impeach Samuel B. Kent, a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Whereas on January 13, 2009, the House approved H. Res. 15, authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire whether the House should impeach G. Thomas Porteous, a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Whereas on October 8, 1998, the House approved H. Res. 581, authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to investigate whether sufficient grounds exist for the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States. Whereas the Committee Report to accompany H. Res. 581 stated: “Because the issue of impeachment is of such overwhelming importance, the Committee decided that it must receive authorization from the full House before proceeding on any further course of action.” Whereas that report further stated: “Because impeachment is delegated solely to the House of Representatives by the Constitution, the full House of Representatives should be involved in critical decision making regarding various stages of impeachment.” Whereas the Speaker’s extraordinary decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry without any debate or vote on such a resolution by the full House undermines the voting privileges afforded to each Member and the constituents they represent. Whereas this unprecedented and politically motivated decision by Speaker Pelosi represents an abuse of power and brings discredit to the House of Representatives: Now, therefore, be it Resolved: That the House of Representatives disapproves of the actions of the Speaker of the House, Mrs. Pelosi of California, to initiate an impeachment inquiry against the duly elected President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Since Democrats are in the majority, they control what votes happen on the floor. But as the GOP leader in the House of Representatives, even though he is in the minority, McCarthy has the ability–he is the only Republican with the ability–to force a vote on a privileged resolution almost immediately. So McCarthy did just that–he introduced the resolution as privileged and forced the full House of Representatives to vote on it on Wednesday evening:

Here is the text of the Rep. McCarthy (R-CA) @GOPLeader privileged resolution – pic.twitter.com/CMdedyGvgR — Republican Cloakroom (@RepCloakroom) September 25, 2019

HAPPENING NOW→ I'm introducing a privileged resolution for the House to vote on. ""The House of Reps disapproves of the actions of Speaker Pelosi to initiate an impeachment inquiry against the duly elected President of the US, @realDonaldTrump."" Read the full resolution↓ pic.twitter.com/9xgYoVAl8P — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) September 25, 2019

Democrats fought back against McCarthy’s efforts, pushing what’s called a motion to table McCarthy’s privileged resolution. That is where the vote of record happened–a vote for the motion to table was a vote against the resolution, and vice versa. The motion to table succeeded along party lines, with 231 House Democrats voting for it and 193 House Republicans voting against it. Former Republican, now “Independent” Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also voted with the Democrats. Five Republicans and three Democrats did not vote.

In other words, in plain English, the Democrats, by shooting down McCarthy’s resolution, have now formally all gone on the record in support of Pelosi’s impeachment inquiry–and the Republicans have now all gone on the record against it. Even more plainly, this was the vote that formally opened impeachment proceedings. They are all on the record now.

No Democrat in the House of Representatives now claim it is not their intention to attempt to remove the duly elected president of the United States from office by force rather than by an election. They also cannot be ambivalent about it anymore. There is no more splitting hairs, no more supporting an “investigation” without backing impeachment, no more saying they need more facts to figure out what’s next. All the cards are on the table: Every Democrat in the House supports removing Trump from office and not waiting until November 2020 to have an election.

What’s more, in perhaps good news for Trump, he lost zero Republicans. The GOP is unified behind its president. Impeachment being partisan is an optics win for Trump, as it feeds his narrative that the Democrats are power-hungry and cannot beat him at the ballot box, so they are using extraordinary measures to attempt to seize the office by force.

“The Democrats can’t hide anymore,” a second senior GOP aide told Breitbart News. “Every last one of them now has the blood of this failed coup all over their hands. And America can see it.”"
397,,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/25/state-of-delusion-democrats-privately-panic-following-transcript-impeachment-fallout/,2019-09-25T00:00:00,State of Delusion: Democrats Privately Panic Following Transcript Fallout,"Democrats and Republicans demonstrated starkly different reactions following the release of the unredacted transcript of President Trump’s conversation with the president of Ukraine.

Many congressional Democrats publicly declared it the “smoking gun,” while Republicans dismissed their cries by noting the absence of quid pro quo or generally lawless behavior.

However, Democrats are striking a drastically different tone privately, as several reports indicate.

The far-left flank of the Democrat caucus forced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to concede and announce a formal impeachment inquiry against the president on Tuesday. She made the announcement prior to the release of the transcript, which detailed the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

As Republican lawmakers explicitly noted, the conversation contained “zero” grounds for a legitimate impeachment inquiry. The president’s request for a “favor,” Republicans added, was immediately followed by a reference to Crowdstrike and questions revolving around election meddling and hacking efforts. Joe Biden’s (D) son, Hunter Biden, was not mentioned until later in the conversation.

“President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating ‘Crowdstrike’ (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelensky, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond ‘Crowdstrike,'” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said in a statement, noting that Biden’s “possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son” was not mentioned until after the fact.

“Just read transcript of POTUS’ call w/Ukraine Pres. Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote. “This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!”

“Wow. Impeachment over this?” Rep Lindsey Graham (R-SC) expressed. “What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.”

Publicly, Democrats have claimed that the transcript is the “smoking gun,” accusing Trump of betrayal and calling him a “cheat,” while repeatedly taking the lines from the conversation out of context, attributing the “favor” to Biden’s son:

“I would like you to do us a favor”…”whatever you can do with [Barr] would be great.” This #UkraineTranscript is @realDonaldTrump’s version and he admitted to betrayal. America is too great of a country to be led by such a cheat. #ImpeachTrump — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) September 25, 2019

Spoiler alert: President Trump attempted to bribe and extort a foreign leader for political gain. This—and so many other infractions he’s committed against our Constitution—is why it’s time to #ImpeachTrumpNow.https://t.co/OnijHI0p0y — Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (@RepRashida) September 25, 2019

The transcript of the call reads like a classic mob shakedown: – We do a lot for Ukraine

– There’s not much reciprocity

– I have a favor to ask

– Investigate my opponent

– My people will be in touch Nice country you got there. It would be a shame if something happened to her. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 25, 2019

However, the public calls are overshadowed by reports of internal freakouts among Democrats, who believe this is a losing battle. As Breitbart News reported, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed hesitation and concern over the party’s decision to pull the trigger on impeachment. One senior Democrat congressional aide called the impeachment effort “a joke” and “all bullshit”:

Privately, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed concerns about the lack of a focus on the impeachment move; without a clear outcome in mind, Democrats fear that whatever happens will further energize Trump ahead of the 2020 election while failing to remove him. “If you’re going to take a shot at the king, you best not miss,” one House Democrat leadership aide told Breitbart News. “And we do not have a pathway to win without 20 GOP votes in the Senate. We are nowhere near that, not even close.” Another senior Democrat congressional aide added regarding the move to attempt to impeach Trump: “It’s a joke. It’s all bullshit.” Over on the Senate side, most Republicans are in line with Trump. While Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said that he considers the transcript’s contents “troubling,” he declined to discuss “impeachment” at this time.

Politico paralleled those sentiments, noting the “creeping anxiety throughout the party [that] it [impeachment] might only help the president clinch a second term.” The outlet spoke to several Democrat officials, who expressed that impeachment could very well backfire on Democrats.

“Of course, I want impeachment from a moral perspective,” Pete Buttigieg’s former New Hampshire director Michael Ceraso told Politico. “But from a political perspective, I don’t want to spend a year talking about how Democrats tried to impeach him and couldn’t pull it off.”

Instead of health care and kitchen-table economics — the issues the party ran on in last year’s blue-wave election — the campaign will inevitably be consumed by a doomed effort to boot Trump from office, skeptics say. All when Trump will be on the ballot in a matter of months, anyway “The Democrats become single-issue candidates, which weakens them,” Ceraso said, adding that the proceedings will only solidify Trump’s base.

Another Democrat strategist told Politico that Pelosi should have taken “one for the team” as she has been doing for months, rather than succumbing to the left’s call for an impeachment inquiry:

One Democratic strategist familiar with multiple presidential campaigns in Iowa said the party’s eventual nominee would be better served if House Democrats decline to open proceedings, even as candidates publicly urge them to. He reacted with alarm as Pelosi signaled Monday that she had become more open to the possibility of impeachment. “She needs to take one for the team and say, ‘Nope, we’re not doing it,’” the strategist said, before Pelosi greenlighted an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Another Democratic strategist with ties to the national party agreed. Holding the earlier Democratic line — with Democratic presidential candidates calling for impeachment and Pelosi declining to go there — would also help vulnerable Democratic House members with their reelection bids. “I think that works well for both Congress and the candidate because then [House members] can say they stand against the nominee,” the strategist said.

Even Sean Bagniewski, chairman of Iowa’s Polk County Democrats, signaled that Iowans at the Polk County Steak Fry did not have an appetite for impeachment.

“I talked to a lot of people, and it didn’t come up once, not at all,” he told Politico. “I’m sure it really energizes Twitter, but Twitter doesn’t vote.”

Bagniewski suggested that the endless impeachment efforts are distracting Democrats from issues that voters care about.

“The bread-and-butter issues are more important now than ever,” Bagniewski told Politico. “We all need to start deciding what we want to be spending our time on.”

His concerns are not isolated. The Democrat-led House has faced criticism for appearing to spend more time passing relatively meaningless resolutions while only paying lip service to “bread and butter” issues on their social media platforms.

Politico also cited Democrat strategist Hank Sheinkopf – who called impeachment a “national spectacle” – and Democratic National Committee member Bob Mulholland, who called impeachment a “political disaster for us Democrats”:

“It’s a national spectacle that will make people defend the presidency or tune out, which is worse,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime Democratic strategist based in New York. “The incessant banging about it doesn’t help. Stick with issues that work.” Bob Mulholland, a Democratic National Committee member from California, put it this way: “Absent Trump being caught in a trunk with a young boy, impeachment is a political disaster for us Democrats.”

Political analyst Charlie Cook noted that he was “totally underwhelmed by the transcript” and added that it will not help Democrats in their efforts to get Americans on board with impeaching the president:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters. — Charlie Cook (@CharlieCookDC) September 25, 2019

Even presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) went against the outspoken cries from her party, admitting that the transcript does not demonstrate a “compelling case” for impeachment:

NEW: @TulsiGabbard joined @krystalball and me this afternoon. She tell us that the transcript does NOT show a ""compelling case"" for impeaching @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Xyc39eQL2Z — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) September 25, 2019

As the fallout continues, Democrats are moving the goalposts, claiming that there no longer needs to be “no quid pro quo,” as Juan Williams concluded on Fox News’s The Five on Wednesday.

Despite the public cries of victory from certain Democrat lawmakers, Republicans smell blood.

Breitbart News reported:

“The Democrats are fucked,” a senior Senate GOP aide told Breitbart News upon reviewing the transcript. “This is going to unite everyone except maybe Mitt, I bet even Ben Sasse comes around on this and backs the president unless there’s some bombshell with the whistleblower who didn’t even hear this call. Republican operatives I’ve talked to are giddy about this.”

GOP lawmakers are using the left’s hysteria to their advantage, reminding the American people of the issues Democrats are ignoring – health care, border security, and homelessness – whilst distracting themselves with the endless list of grievances designed to take the president down:

As I travel across West Virginia, I talk to folks who are sick and tired of this purely partisan investigation aimed at reversing the results of the presidential election. It is time for Democrats to move on and start focusing on issues that matter to all Americans. — Rep. Alex Mooney (@RepAlexMooney) September 25, 2019

– It was the Ukrainian President who brought up Giuliani on the call AND – Democrats don't wait for the facts before they jump to conclusions when it comes to President @realdonaldtrump — Congresswoman Debbie Lesko (@RepDLesko) September 25, 2019

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) reminded the American people that Democrats have been actively searching for a catalyst to launch an impeachment inquiry since Trump’s inauguration.

“Since the day President Trump was elected, congressional Democrats have been working to find any reason under the sun to impeach the president and undo the results of the last election,” Cruz stated.

“First, it was Mueller, then the Mueller report found no collusion. Now it’s Ukraine. Next month, it will be something else,” he continued.

He added that “facts don’t matter to congressional Democrats” and predicted that Pelosi will “continue to be hounded by the far left of her caucus to halt all other legislative work to focus on attacking the president.”

As Breitbart News reported, Pelosi’s cave demonstrates that she lost the battle for control of her caucus, succumbing to the demands of the far-left “Squad.”

Additionally, the Trump campaign and RNC’s announcement of a combined $5 million raised since Pelosi’s initial launch of the impeachment inquiry essentially confirms the Democrat insiders’ mounting fears: The American public is not on board with impeachment, and the GOP – including Trump’s base – is ready for war."
398,,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/25/leftists-target-trumps-liquor-license-at-dc-hotel-over-his-character/,2019-09-25T00:00:00,Leftists Target Trump’s Liquor License at DC Hotel over His ‘Character’,"A cohort of apparent leftists have targeted the Trump International Hotel’s liquor license in Washington, D.C., arguing that the hotel’s owner, President Donald Trump, is “not of good character” and that the hotel should therefore be stripped of its liquor license. A regulatory agency in D.C. has since dismissed the complaint.

Attorney Joshua A. Levy filed the complaint to D.C.’s Alcohol Beverage Control Board in June 2018 on behalf of eight purported D.C. residents, claiming that President Donald Trump had been breaking D.C. law by simply owning a business that maintains a liquor license, according to a report by ABC News.

Levy said when he filed the complaint last year:

President Trump is not above the law. In D.C., the law requires an owner of a liquor license to be of ‘good character,’ and Mr. Trump is not. He should transfer the ownership to someone who can comply with the law or show cause why his license should not be revoked.

The complainants argued that the Trump International Hotel in D.C. should be stripped of its liquor license due to the U.S. president’s alleged lack of “good character.”

“With each passing day, the story of Donald Trump’s lack of good character continues to play out in the public,” said Levy. “Residents of the district can and should come forward to urge the liquor board to reach the merits of this complaint.”

Arguments for the complaint were last heard on September 18.

“This is not about the neighborhood, not about the common good and certainly not about the law,” said Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, to ABC after the complaint was initially filed. “This is politics at its worst and an obvious effort to misuse the power of government to advance a political agenda.”

“The statute is clearly being distorted for political gain and the suggested interpretation would create an absurd precedent, not to mention a slippery slope,” he added.

The board has since dismissed the case on the basis of a residency requirement, and it did not end up making a decision on the merits of the claim, according to ABC, which added that the dismissal paperwork noted “that the purported group of eight residents and property owners does not contain at least five residents or property owners” within D.C.

According to the board, only four of the original complainants were found to have been residents and property owners in Washington, D.C., resulting in the case being dismissed.

In December of 2018, Kian, who is also known as Bijan Rafiekian, was indicted in Robert Mueller’s expansive federal probe of Russian Collusion, which ended up proving the whole thing was a hoax manufactured by Democrats and the media, but did ensnare people such as Kian and Michael Flynn, who was President Trump’s national security adviser.

In July of 2019, just eight months after the indictment, a Virginia jury convicted Kian of illegally lobbying in the U.S. on behalf of the Turkish government.

According to the Hill, Kian was facing 15 years in prison.

Hey, another Big Win for left-wing superhero Robert Mueller, right?

Except…

On Wednesday a federal judge overturned the entire verdict, based on a lack of evidence and inadequate instructions to the jury on “the use of hearsay statements, the role of Flynn or the knowledge required to convict Rafiekian on one of the charges.”

“The Government failed to present substantial evidence for a rational juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Rafekian knowingly participated in a conspiracy to…act as an unregistered agent of a foreign government…and make willful and material false statements and omissions in a FARA filing,” the judge wrote.

Prosecutors have not said if they will refile charges, but did release a statement, saying, “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is reviewing the Court’s opinion vacating the jury’s verdict in the Rafiekian matter. We do not have any further comment at this time.”

Think about the possible corruption at work here. It is extremely rare for a judge to overturn a verdict such as this, and the fact that the apparent corruption began with an indictment and lasted straight through to jury instructions is enough to take your breath away.

Robert Mueller and his crooked gang of extremist Democrats were on a vendetta to destroy anyone associated with Trump, and anyone associated with anyone associated with Trump. If they couldn’t indict them, the Mueller cabal tried to bankrupt them or intimidate them, as they did to Gen. Flynn.

Just one more example of the breathtaking abuse of power behind this coup and a corrupt media that aid and bet, rather than expose it.

.@TeamTrump and @GOP raised nearly $30M in last week because of Hollywood extremists and the continued witch hunt being led by deranged Dems in the House. Next to @realDonaldTrump, Democrats are our best fundraisers! Thanks, Nancy! https://t.co/8yUgLAv5US — Richard Walters (@rww_gop) September 25, 2019

Last week, the RNC announced “a record $23.5 million [raised] in August” as well as “$53.8 million cash on hand,” as Breitbart News reported.

The spike in fundraising follows the Democrat Party’s heavy push for impeachment, which remains widely unpopular among American voters, as recent polls indicate.

Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday after months of stiff-arming the efforts, telling Democrats in a caucus-wide call last month that the public “isn’t there” yet on impeachment. Nonetheless, the Speaker ultimately succumbed to demands, using the whistleblower complaint as a catalyst for the inquiry.

The transcript detailing Trump’s conversation with the Ukranian president, released Wednesday, showed no quid pro quo and no legitimate grounds for impeachment, as several Republican lawmakers pointed out.

“Since the day President Trump was elected, congressional Democrats have been working to find any reason under the sun to impeach the president and undo the results of the last election,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said in a statement Wednesday.

“First, it was Mueller, then the Mueller report found no collusion. Now it’s Ukraine. Next month, it will be something else,” he predicted."

“If you’re a Democrat, you have automatic protection,” Trump said. “That is years and years of people putting in certain people into positions.”

The president spoke about Biden during a press conference in New York City on Wednesday.

Trump pointed to the enormous pressure put on his administration and his staff by Democrats and the media, suggesting that Biden and his family experienced nothing similar.

“When you look at all of the trauma that these fakers have caused, and the press, look, much of the press is not only fake, it is corrupt,” he said. “These stories they write are corrupt. They’re so wrong and they know that.”

Trump said that House Democrats were vicious in their pursuit of his administration.

“When you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic — smart guy, by the way — stand at the mic and act like he’s so serious, and then he goes into a room with Nadler and they must laugh their asses off,” he said."

This 54 to 41 vote was not about the border wall, but whether “the Congress of the United States of America should yield its constitutionally prescribed power of the purse to the President,” said Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins.

“The answer to that question, regardless of who is in the White House … should be no,” Collins continued. “Congress alone is empowered by the constitution to adopt laws directing money from the U.S. Treasury.”

The president “stole” the money, and “I will not stand for that,” said Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy. The president took the funding from other projects, such as the replacement of older schools at military bases, said Leahy, who is the top Democrat on the appropriations panel.

Senators should vote against the resolution because “there is no Earthly reason why Democrats would force us to have one or the other,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).

“The joint resolution is passed,” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney announced from the Senate’s chair.

The 11 GOP senators who voted against the emergency and the wall included Collins, Romney, retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (TN), along with Sens. Roy Blunt (MO), Mike Lee (UT), Jerry Moran (KS), Lisa Murkowski (AK), Rand Paul (KY), Rob Portman (OH), Pat Toomey (PA), and Roger Wicker (MS).

Collins spoke during the brief debate and vote, saying she supported additional construction at the border.

Several GOP senators declined to vote.

Trump will likely veto the resolution, and the 54 votes in favor are not enough to overcome the president’s veto.

Trump announced the emergency in February after Democrats blocked the funding for the border wall. Trump’s emergency declaration uses powers that prior Congresses voted to give to the president."

But on the basis of one drama queen’s overreaction to a rumor she’d heard about what was said on a phone call she didn’t hear (I’m assuming the whistleblower is Christine Blasey Ford), the Democrats have launched impeachment proceedings against the president.

I guess they figured it’s easier than flying to South Dakota with picks and chisels and carving Trump into Mount Rushmore. But it will have the same effect.

Now that the transcript has been released, it’s the New York Times that doesn’t want anyone to see it.

The transcript I’d like to see is the one of Nancy Pelosi reading the Trump transcript.

F@@@@@@CK! Whose f***ing idea was it to demand this goddamn transcript?

F@CK!

F@@CK!

F@@@CK!

The absolute worst version for Trump — i.e. the one being repeated non-stop on MSNBC — is that he did exactly what Obama and Biden were doing to Ukraine: intimidating an ally into giving us something in exchange for the foreign aid we were giving them.

Biden himself bragged about getting Ukraine’s prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold a big fat check from them.

The Democrats’ argument is: No, no, no! When WE were pressuring Ukraine, we were doing it for good! Don’t you understand? We’re good; they’re bad.

The other reason the media are going to have to bury this transcript is that Trump brought up a few items that the media have been hoping the public would never find out about.

Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Well, that’s something the media haven’t mentioned before. Ninety-nine percent of Americans will be hearing about the funny business with Biden’s son, Hunter, for the first time with the release of this transcript.

Why did Vice President Biden order the Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor investigating the Ukrainian company paying his son millions of dollars? Are Democrats claiming that this company was clean as a whistle and it was an absolute OUTRAGE that it was being investigated?

Ukraine was looking into the company that conveniently placed Hunter Biden on its board long before Trump came on the scene. Something must have made the Ukrainian prosecutor want to investigate Biden’s company — and it sure wasn’t to curry favor with the Obama/Biden administration.

The second issue the media does not want anyone to think about is CrowdStrike.

What is CrowdStrike, you ask? That is the cybersecurity firm that is the sole source of the claim that the Russians hacked the DNC’s emails — which launched the conspiracy theories that tied our country in knots for the past three years.

The Russian collusion story was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 to cover up the utter corruption revealed by the dump of Democratic National Committee emails on Wikileaks. As was her practice whenever a scandal threatened to engulf her, Hillary rushed out and told the press to investigate something else.

And “the great story” about the DNC email hack wasn’t about a “vast right-wing conspiracy” — as she claimed when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. No, this time, it was a vast Russian conspiracy!

At the time, the entire media laughed at Hillary’s Russian conspiracy nonsense — the New York Times, New York Newsday, the Los Angeles Times, and so on. But then Trump won the election, and suddenly the Russia conspiracy seemed totally believable. What else could explain how Americans could put this boob in the White House?

The subsequent three years of breathless Russia coverage was based entirely on the word of one cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, that the DNC’s emails had been hacked by Russia.

Recall that the DNC wouldn’t allow the FBI or any other U.S. government official anywhere near its computers. That’s precisely why so many cybersecurity experts doubted that it was the Russians: The FBI was never allowed to perform its own investigation.

CrowdStrike was founded by Ukrainian Dmitri Alperovitch (now an American citizen apparently — because who isn’t?) and funded by the fanatically anti-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk Foundation.

Talk about interfering with our democracy! Alperovitch and Pinchuk sent one political party and nine-tenths of the American media off on a wild goose chase into Russian collusion that, after years of accusations, investigations and embarrassing conspiracy-mongering … turned up goose eggs.

The entire Russian insanity was launched by a couple of Ukrainians. I think a lot of us would like to get to the bottom of that.

This is why Trump said to President Zelensky: “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

(How’d you like to be the Ukrainian translator for a Trump conversation?)

Trump has been justly criticized for hiring his daughter and son-in-law at the White House. But at least when he pressures a foreign leader for a favor, it’s to investigate corruption, not to get a prosecutor off his son’s back. Maybe Biden’s son was guilty, maybe he was innocent. But it is a fact that Joe Biden held up foreign aid to a desperately needy ally in exchange for their halting prosecution that implicated his son. It’s not Trump’s fault that Biden is now running for president.

I’ll give the Democrats this: They’ve gotten so good at trying to remove Trump from office that, instead of three years, their insane accusations blow up in their faces within a week."
405,,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/25/sen-david-perdue-oks-silicon-valley-takeover-of-college-graduate-job-market/,2019-09-25T00:00:00,Sen. Perdue OKs Silicon Valley Takeover of College Graduate Job Market,"Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) now supports Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) green card giveaway bill, which will allow investors to reward many more Indian graduates for taking middle-class jobs from American college graduates.

Perdue’s decision to end his opposition to the bill clears the way for Lee to rush his bill through the Senate on Thursday. If no other senators object, Lee’s bill will move through the Senate, putting it much closer to becoming law.

The bill allows investors and their companies to reward many more Indian graduates who agree to take the college graduate jobs needed by young American graduates. The reward is the grant of 120,000 invaluable green cards — up from roughly 20,000 today — to the Indian outsourcing workers and their families.

That’s a huge boost for the investors in the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, who now import Indian graduates to spike stock prices by chopping white-collar payroll costs. So Perdue’s retreat is also a huge economic hit to the roughly 800,000 Americans who are graduating in 2019 with degrees in health care, science, engineering, accounting, business, software, math, or architecture.

The bill could also disrupt the immigration system for many other foreign migrants, including younger “dreamer” illegals and university scientists, as well as the next wave of foreign students, scientists, and professionals who are seeking to move into the United States. The House has already passed its version of the bill, H.R. 1044.

Perdue’s retreat was reported by Immigration Voice, a lobbying group of foreign workers who were imported by investors to take the middle-class jobs sought by U.S. graduates. The McClatchy News Service reported Perdue’s switch:

Georgia Sen. David Perdue says he no longer objects to Sen. Lee's green card bill: ""I supported his bill. It's consistent with what the White House has been working on. We just had some nuances in the language with regard to rural nurses and basically we worked that out."" — Bryan Lowry (@BryanLowry3) September 25, 2019

The Indian visa workers are now urging their members to call Sen. Dick Durbin’s (D-IL) office out of fear he might block Lee’s giveaway:

🚨ILLINOIS ACTION ITEM ALERT 🚨 Dear Friends, We need our members in Illinois to call Senator Dick Durbin in his Washington DC office at 202.224.2152 and ask him to support the unanimous consent of the bi-partisan Harris-Lee – Fairness For High Skilled immigrants act. Team IV — Immigration Voice (@immivoice) September 25, 2019

Durbin’s potential opposition was spotlighted by a September 7 report in the Wall Street Journal:

Democrats in the Senate have qualms, too. “They are increasing the immigration from countries like India a marginal small amount at the expense of cutting back on immigration from other countries in a much more dramatic fashion—I don’t think there’s equity in that,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).

Perdue’s office did not respond to Breitbart News. On September 19, Perdue explained his hold on Lee’s bill:

I want to comment my good friend from the great state of Utah, SM Lee, for his work on putting this bill together and pulling the people together to support this bill. I support this bill. Madam President. We have some language that needs to be clarified, and I still have some concerns about the impact this legislation would have on some specific industries, you know in my state but in the country. I want to work with Senator only in addressing these concerns and come to a resolution on this very quickly. I commit to working with him and his team to make sure that we get to a resolution because we want the exact same thing. And this is totally consistent with President [Donald] Trump is trying to do in as long term work to fix our broken immigration system in with that.

Activists say no GOP senators are ready to step forward to protect American graduates from the huge inflow of underpaid Indian graduates. Even populist senators such as Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) have avoided criticizing the investors’ stealthy no-hearing, no-debates rush to pass the bill.

Their passive stance comes amid a huge but stealthy push led by the technology companies and investors, such as Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and the Washington Post. The backers include Mark Zuckerberg, who met with Lee on September 19, on the same day that Perdue blocked his bill.

The demand by investors for endless migrant labor has created a new thing: The US-India Outsourcing Economy. This no-regulation zone redirects new wealth into a few cities & a small elite. Elites want to expand it, so US college-grads get #HR1044. https://t.co/4lWHtI3sUk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) July 19, 2019

Business groups have told senators that the bill is a minor change to immigration law and is intended to rectify what they describe as anti-Indian “country caps” discrimination. Those business groups already employ roughly 1.5 million foreign white-collar workers in the United States, including at least 800,000 Indians graduates.

Opponents and supporters of the green card giveaway are using Facebook and Twitter to urge their supporters to call senators to block or support the bill.

Only one GOP senator is needed to stop Lee’s bill, which is expected to be brought to the Senate floor on Thursday for a no-debate, no-media, fast-track “Unanimous Consent” approval process.

Few Democrats — if any — oppose Lee’s S.386 bill, which is strongly backed by the pro-Democrat Silicon Valley investors.

Nearly all Democrats voted for the House version of the bill.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have said they oppose the Indian outsourcing bill — but White House officials have not said if the bill will be opposed by President Donald Trump — even though Trump needs to boost his sagging support among white-collar suburban voters.

White-collar Americans have formed a series of groups to defend their careers against the investors’ visa workers. They include the American Workers Coalition, ProUSworkers, and Doctorswithoutjobs.com.

These groups say that the expanded number of green cards will flood the labor markets for engineers and software experts. The bill will also allow U.S. investors to annually recruit hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates to compete for American college jobs and green cards. The Indians can get work permits via the uncapped Optional Practical Training (OPT), B1, L-1, H4EAD, and H-1B visa worker programs. U.S. workers also say they are routinely discriminated against and excluded by the U.S.-based Indian managers and Indian recruiters who run the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy.

Lou Dobbs, on Fox News, has repeatedly denounced the giveaway:

#AmericaFirst– @EdRollins: @POTUS has made a commitment to create jobs for Americans, particularly young Americans coming out of college. This Senate bill would create competition for them by giving visas to Indian students & give them jobs at lower wages. #NOS386 #MAGA #Dobbs pic.twitter.com/ipZuAlQllv — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) September 23, 2019

Populist groups — such as Americans for Legal Immigration PAC — also oppose the Silicon Valley takeover.

Additionally, would-be immigrants are opposing the Lee bill because it will push the investors’ current army of at least 300,000 Indian tech workers — plus more to come — up to the head of the line for 120,000 green cards each year. For example, the Multinational Coalition includes many Chinese graduate students who will have to work as low-wage student lab technicians for many years in their late 20s if they hope to get green cards.

These pro-migration opponents of Lee’s bill also include Support All of Us and many other pro-migration groups who are keeping their opposition quiet.

This shift towards Indian outsourcing will also cut off the flow of employer-sponsored migrants into Florida’s Spanish-speaking economy, say immigration lawyers in Florida.

This bill is a giveaway overwhelmingly to one industry (tech) and it means that individuals from one country (India) will get most to all of the employment-based visas for the next 10 years, within even longer backlogs after that. — Amy Maldonado (@AmyMaldonadoLaw) September 25, 2019

But Perdue’s shift is being cheered by the India visa workers who take the graduate jobs needed by Americans. For example, “Ramesh S,” who is working in North Carolina, applauded Perdue’s switch:

Thank you 🙏, @sendavidperdue for hearing us and agreeing to support and co-sponsor S386 bill. pic.twitter.com/Y3LxPfLZeg — Ramesh S (@chandar2020) September 25, 2019

Most of the Indian workers are being imported to run the U.S. side of the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, which is used by investors to transfer Americans’ salaries into their Wall Street stock values.

For example, Walmart is boosting its stock value by outsourcing 569 finance and accounting jobs in North Carolina to cheaper H-1B workers from India. If the company saves $10,000 per employee, Walmart will save $5.7 million per year. On Wall Street, Walmart’s price to earnings rate is 25 to one, so the $5.7 million in payroll savings will boost its stockholders’ value by $142 million.

Walmart picked an American company, Genpact, to supply the Indian workers. The company is a spin-off of General Electric, and it prospers by providing Indian H-1B workers to many companies in the United States. For example, the company asked for 271 H-1Bs in 2018, 410 H-1Bs in 2017, and 307 H-1Bs in 2016.

Genpact’s H-1Bs work on the U.S. side of the vast and growing U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, now worth roughly $78 billion per year. Part of the H-1Bs’ job is to funnel additional work back into India. For example, Genpact may only need to use 100 H-1Bs in North Carolina to help steer the work of the 569 fired American finance experts back to large teams of low-wage Indian graduates in India.

Genpact’s $3.3 billion in revenue is enough to generate $7.5 billion in stock value for its investors, which include Bain Capital, Blackrock, and Charles Schwab Investment Management.

Employers reward the low-wage Indian workers by giving them green cards, which allow them to become U.S. citizens — and to then import their immediate and extended families from India to the United States.

The investors are mostly based on the coasts, so their wealth is helping to spike income and real estate values in New York and California — while the reduced investment and payroll in heartland states reduce their business income, real estate values, skilled workforces, and political power.

H-1B imported workers in Georgia get paid less than Americans, so they spend less (about $300M less) on local groceries, retail, rents, etc. Investors send the savings to Wall St. to get 25:1 gains. IOW, visa workers hurt many & help the few wealthy @S386 https://t.co/LI7eHEAfN3 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 25, 2019

Immigration Numbers

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full-time, year-round work."

The fake story, which ran Wednesday afternoon, claims:

The acting Director of National Intelligence [Joseph Maguire] threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.

The story was published just hours after the White House released the transcript of a call between Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. The transcript debunked the latest Media-Democrat hoax that claims Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The actual transcript shows no such thing, and during a press conference with Trump on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president confirmed he was not pressured.

Just moments after the Post’s phony story ran, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement on Twitter that says of the Post story, “This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.”

This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond. This is actually not true.

A few moments later, Maguire himself released a statement debunking the Post’s fake news: “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community…”

Throughout the nearly three years of the media’s Russia Collusion Hoax, along with CNN and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, the Post was one of the leading purveyors of fake news, including a ludicrous story about the Russians hacking into a Vermont power grid.

Then there was the Post’s now-debunked claim the Obama administration did not spy on Trump (it did), and the phony claim the Trump campaign changed its platform on Ukraine to appease Putin (it didn’t). On top of that nonsense was the Post’s ludicrous fake news about Russia hacking the election systems of 21 states, the claim there is a lot of evidence of Trump-Russia collusion (there is none), the whopper about Trump revealing classified information to the Russians (he did not), and this extra large whopper: “Rudy Giuliani just told America that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia.”

The full list is here.

Publishing a flurry of fake news as one of its hoaxes collapses, in this case the Ukraine Hoax, is standard operating procedure for the Washington Post and the rest of our crooked news media. The idea is to distract from the debunking of the primary hoax with a chaos narrative that hurls anything against the wall. This garbage never sticks, but it does allow our fake media to hold on to the dream that they really got Drumpf this time a little while longer.

In a letter to Columbia University President Lee Bollinger, Lauder said the last straw for him was the university’s invitation to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, who is slated to speak on campus on Wednesday. Mohamed is known for his extremist views and for repeatedly espousing antisemitism, including smearing Jews as “hook-nosed” and claiming “Jews rule the world by proxy.”

Amid calls from opponents of antisemitism to nix the visit, Bollinger defended the invitation, writing in a letter to student groups that “this form of open engagement can sometimes be difficult, even painful.”

“But to abandon this activity would be to limit severely our capacity to understand and confront the world as it is, which is a central and utterly serious mission for any academic institution,” Bollinger argued.

In his letter to Bollinger, Lauder retorted, “I understand, from your statement, that you believe it is in the interest of education that all views are aired at Columbia. With all the world leaders and statesmen in New York this week, I wonder why this man’s views are so vital?”

The Jewish leader called on donors to withhold future contributions:

I am not a Columbia alum. I went to Penn and my family and I have been among its largest benefactors. I will honestly tell you that if Amy Gutmann at Penn were as consistent in allowing antisemitic speakers on her campus as you are at Columbia, I would seriously consider stopping my funding. Accordingly, I will be encouraging all of my friends to immediately cease any of their contributions to your institution until such a time as antisemitic despots are no longer welcome on your campus.

Columbia and Bollinger faced widespread criticism in September 2007 for playing host to then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, infamous for denying the Holocaust, rejecting Israel’s right to exist and calling for the Jewish state’s destruction. Iran is a leading state sponsor of worldwide terrorism.

Lauder noted Ahmadinejad’s speech as well as instances of pro-Israel students reportedly facing an atmosphere of intimidation.

The World Jewish Congress leader wrote:

I have watched, with growing concern, the incidents and incitement directed against Israel on the Columbia campus, that are nominally called political activity, which have made many Jewish students on your campus less than comfortable. Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, have been understandably upset with this ongoing situation at Columbia, because the complaints from students have grown, along with the increased vitriol against them. So with that as the backdrop, along with the 2007 speech by a hate filled, Holocaust-denying Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, I am joining the growing chorus of those upset over your giving Mohamed an opportunity to air his anti-Semitism on your campus.

In his response to critics, Bollinger wrote that Mohamed’s invitation should not be taken as “validation” or an “endorsement” of the politician’s views.

“I find the anti-semitic statements of Prime Minister Mahathir to be abhorrently contrary to what we stand for, and deserving condemnation. Nevertheless, it is in these times that we are most strongly resolved to insist that our campus remain an open forum and to protect the freedoms essential to our university community,” Bollinger wrote."

Speaking on Israel’s i24NEWS (video above), Klein said that as long as Israel does not have a stable, permanent government in place Iran might feel it can get away with escalating regional tensions.

“I will tell you one party at least that is not going to sit around and wait. And that is Iran,” stated Klein.

“What is happening in the Middle East today is very serious. Iran is brazen. They are out of control. And I think that they could smell an opportunity coming out of Israel if a unity government or some sort of stable coalition isn’t formed very quickly. Iran is not going to sit around and wait for a unity deal.”

Last week’s national elections left both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party unable to form a coalition without agreeing to a unity deal between them. Israel is currently ruled by an interim government led by Netanyahu.

During the election campaign, Gantz said that he is open to a unity coalition with Likud if the party first ousts Netanyahu, who faced an indictment hearing next week regarding allegations of bribery and corruption. Netanyahu has strongly denied the allegations and can legally serve as prime minister unless any formal conviction takes place and that could take over a year.

Netanyahu is negotiating with a bloc of religious and nationalist parties and would not agree to a unity coalition if he is not the head of Likud.

There is also the issue of whether any unity deal would see Gantz and Netanyahu rotate the premiership and which leader will first be tasked by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to attempt to form a coalition that must consist of more than 60 seats in the 120 seat Knesset.

Iran two weeks ago was fingered for carrying out aerial strikes on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.

Klein, meanwhile, argued that the biggest loser of the latest election was the Israeli left, with results slated to be finalized tomorrow. Left wing parties have traditionally made the creation of a Palestinian state into a major policy objective.

The Labor-Gesher alliance is projected to only get 6 seats, a devastating fall from grace for Israel’s Labor party which historically was the largest or second largest party in the Knesset. Labor needed to run in a coalition with Gesher so it didn’t fall below the threshold of not winning enough votes to enter the Knesset.

The leftist Meretz party also needed to merge with another leftist party to form the Democratic Union in order to get enough seats to enter the Knesset with a four seat minimum. The union of those parties is only slated to win five seats.

Asked by the i24NEWS host if it would be better for Netanyahu to get the “first crack” at forming a coalition, Klein replied: “I think whether he gets the first crack or the second crack at the end of the day the Israeli electorate spoke and they want, it seems, a unity government.”

“You look, though, at the results of this election. This clearly was a loss for the left in Israel or what’s left of the left. So it seems like the dividing lines are more along religious. Ultra-religious versus secular and not right-left.”"

Mike Lee’s (R-UT) effort to allow India and China to monopolize the United States’ green card system.

Lee’s S. 386 provides a massive giveaway to Big Tech corporations like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft — all of which are donors to the Utah Senator.

The legislation will ensure outsourcing firms such as Cognizant and Infosys, as well as giant tech conglomerates like Amazon and Facebook, have a green card system wherein employers would have to wait seven to eight years before securing an employment-based green card for a hire.

This process would solidify that employment-based green cards only go to temporary foreign visa workers, like those imported on the H-1B visa, thus rewarding those corporations who replace their American employees with H-1B foreign visa workers who are overwhelmingly Indian male nationals.

While about 25 percent of all employment-based green cards currently are rewarded to Indian nationals today, should Lee’s legislation pass, Indian nationals will obtain more than 90 percent of all the employment-based green cards for at least a decade.

Paying out lobbyists to push Republican and Democrat Senators into supporting Lee’s green card giveaway are tech corporations like Google, Microsoft, the Oracle Corporation, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. For instance, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard have sent out a combined total of 18 lobbyists to Capitol Hill to push Lee’s green card giveaway out to Senators.

At the same time, Microsoft has been Lee’s largest tech donor for the last five election cycles, doling out nearly $130,000 to him since 2015. More than $97,000 of those funds went directly to Lee while another $30,000 went to Lee’s PAC.

Likewise, Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. has donated $55,900 to Lee since 2015, while the Oracle Corporation has donated $44,200.

Others bankrolling Lee’s S. 386 are the Koch brothers’ network of organizations, such as Americans for Prosperity, the outsourcing lobby, like Cognizant and the IBM Corporation, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The Chamber of Commerce, for example, has almost 30 lobbyists working to push Lee’s green card giveaway, while Cognizant and IBM have a total of seven lobbyists pushing the legislation. IBM and Cognizant are set to gain hugely from S. 386, as they are two of the largest outsourcers of American jobs in the nation.

This year, alone, Cognizant sought to outsource more than 13,000 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers. IBM — headed by Ginni Rometty who takes in a salary of $16.45 million a year — attempted to outsource nearly 8,500 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers.

The Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity, which has deployed eight lobbyists to push Lee’s green card giveaway, has indirectly been a donor to Lee through the years. Since 2015, Lee has raked in nearly $60,000 from Koch Industries.

Lee’s S. 386 is also being lobbied for by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), which aids illegal aliens and foreign workers in their efforts to not be deported, has sent out three lobbyists to push the green card giveaway.

Though S. 386 was blocked by Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), Lee and Perdue are expected to make a deal on the legislation and hope to take fast-track a vote by the end of this week.

An unnamed child was harassed and then pursued to her house by a coyote that wandered into the Chicago suburbs. Surveillance footage shows her skipping along her driveway, and then diverting toward a swing hanging from a tree in the front lawn.



As she approached the swing, a coyote dashes at her. Alarmed, she turns and runs for her house, pursued by the lunging predator.

The village of Villa Park announced that it had contacted both the DuPage County Forest Preserve and the Illinois Conservation Police regarding the incident. “Like domestic dogs, coyotes test their limits around humans and learn something from each exchange,” the preserve says on its official site:

Unless they associate people with negative experiences, such as loud noises, they can become comfortable walking down streets or sidewalks or near schools, basking in yards or parks, and shortening the distance between themselves and humans.

“A bold coyote does not necessarily mean an aggressive coyote,” the organization writes, “but a coyote that maintains its fear of humans will be less likely to cause problems.”

The girl’s family has confirmed that she is frightened but otherwise unharmed."

Less than two weeks ago, King was a hero after he turned a moment of fleeting fame into a movement that raised over $1.14 million for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital.

On September 13, King, who is now 24, was featured on ESPN College Game Day holding a sign that read “Busch Light supply need replenished. Venmo Carson-King-25.” The national attention resulted in donors from all over contributing money to King’s Venmo account.

Rather than keep the money, King said he would donate it to the children’s hospital. This is when Anheuser-Busch and Venmo agreed to match his donation.

So here’s a young man turning a goof that could have personally enriched him into a legitimately good thing…

Enter the media.

Specifically the Des Moines Register.

For whatever sadistic reason, the Register decided to do a “background check” of a private citizen thrust into the national spotlight and, lo and behold, what they uncovered were a couple of racially-insensitive tweets King fired off when he was 16, when he was still a sophomore in high school.

The paper contacted King to tell him they were going to run with the story. Obviously worried about his reputation, King tried to get ahead of the scandal by releasing the following statement:

It was just 10 days ago that I was a guy in the crowd holding a sign looking for beer money on ESPN Game Day. Since then – so much has happened. Especially when I announced all of the money would be donated to the Stead Family Children’s Hospital in Iowa City. Thousands of people have donated and today the account is at 1.14 million dollars. Much of this has happened thanks to social media – it has the power to bring people together for a common good. It also can make your life very public. And that is why I wanted to share with you that eight years ago – when I was a sophomore in high school, I made some social media posts with my friends that quoted and referenced the show Tosh.0. One of those posts was brought to my attention by a member of the media today. I had no recollection of it. In re-reading it today – eight years later – I see it was an attempt at humor that was offensive and hurtful. I am so embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16 years old. I want to sincerely apologize. Thankfully, high school kids grow up and hopefully become responsible and caring adults. I think my feelings are better summed up by a post from just 3 years ago: “Until we as a people learn that racism and hate are learned behaviors, we won’t get rid of it. Tolerance towards others is the first step.” — July 8, 2016 I am sharing this information tonight because I feel a responsibility to all of the people who have donated money. I cannot go back and change what I posted when I was a 16-year-old. I can apologize and work to improve every day and make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. And, I am so very thankful for the generosity of the thousands of people who have donated to our fundraising push for the Stead Family Children’s Hospital.

Apparently the tweets, which are no longer available, compared black people to gorillas.

The ever-gracious King later released a statement saying he was not angry at the Des Moines Register. King continued:

The Des Moines Register has been nothing but kind in all of their coverage, and I appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me. I want everyone to understand that this was my decision to publicly address the posts and apologize. I believe that is the right thing to do.

Almost immediately, those profiles in courage at Anheuser-Busch cut all ties with King. The company says it will still match his contribution. King says he will still donate the money.

Here’s the statement from the beer company:

Carson King had multiple social media posts that do not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him. We are honoring our commitment by donating more than $350,000 to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.

And then, in a fascinating turn of events that personifies our unforgiving Woke Culture, after the Register piece ran, the Internet dug up a number of offensive tweets published by the same reporter, Aaron Calvin, who dug up King’s tweets.

Calvin has now locked up his Twitter account and the Register says it is aware of the tweets and is looking into them.

One of Calvin’s tweets from 2012 reads, “Can I be a guest instructor at your theater camp teaching the kids how to abuse substances and ‘turn tricks.’”

A tweet from 2013 says, “I want to grow up and read sex stories to high school students.”

According to Twitchy, one of Calvin’s 2011 tweets uses the word “niggas.”

Welcome to the future, y’all…

Anything King might have tweeted after he became a legal adult… Fine. If you must… Fine. Let’s not forget we are talking about an everyday guy guilty of doing nothing more than turning a joke at a sporting event into an objectively good thing, but… Fine.

But now we live in a world where your juvenile criminal record is expunged, but not your juvenile tweets, which means a whole lot of good people who made some dumb mistakes as minors (as we all have) are going to see their reputations burnt to the ground in this unforgiving, witch-hunt culture of ours.

And nothing can be done about it, because there is no way to turn the Twitter Fascists and Virtue Signalers into decent human beings, and there’s no way to inject a spine or sense of decency into big companies like Anheuser-Busch.

The IOC had hoped that their scientific advisors could agree to halve the permitted levels of testosterone in transgender athletes, but the experts could not agree, according to the Guardian.

The current guidelines issued in 2015 maintain that men claiming to be transgender women can compete in the female categories even if they have not completed the transformational surgery only if their testosterone level measures below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before competing.

While some of the IOC’s experts insisted that the current requirements could be lowered further without creating an unfair playing field, others are pointing to recent research which claims that testosterone levels really have little effect on a transgender woman’s biologically male muscle strength.

The Guardian reports that the IOC’s experts went around and around over the issue but could not agree that the new guidelines are warranted.

Another source told the paper that the IOC still has hopes of getting a consensus, but agreement “proved far more difficult than expected because this is such a tricky political and emotive issue.”

In nearly every area of sports where former men compete as women, they have become instant champions over the biological female athletes. From U.S. high school sports, to international cycling competition, to Australian handball, to New Zealand weight lifting, nearly every time a biological male enters women’s categories, biological females lose.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Wednesday addressed reporters after viewing a federal employee’s complaint about President Donald Trump’s telephone conversation with the leader of Ukraine, claiming it “exposed serious wrongdoing.”

House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff speaks after reviewing the whistleblower complaint https://t.co/aYIcGo5zvO pic.twitter.com/Eh0qU5Et4b — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 25, 2019

In his remarks, Schiff described the complaint as “well-written” and praised the still-anonymous individual who authored the complaint as brave.

“What this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing, and I think it a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it was, because it was an urgent matter, it is an urgent matter,” he said.

The complaint, received by acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire a number of weeks ago, alleges that President Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden, back in July.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Although Schiff stands behind the so-called “whistleblower’s” crediblity, the Department of Justice on Wednesday confirmed that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found the individual who made the complaint has a “political bias” that was “in favor of a rival political candidate.”

According to a memo released by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, the inspector general stated that it received a complaint of “urgent concern,” though the OLC determined the matter “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” or require that the national intelligence director send the complaint to House and Senate intelligence committees.

During a joint press conference at the United Nations, both President Trump and Zelensky confirmed the conversation occurred and affirmed no pressure was applied to probe the Biden family. “I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.

Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the call, which shows the pair discussed U.S. military aid to Ukraine and Hunter Biden — and there was no quid pro quo discussed at any point of the conversation.

Nonetheless, the call prompted a group of House Democrats to come out in favor of impeachment and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to endorse a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.

Asked for his thoughts on the move by Pelosi, President Trump suggested the California Democrat has lost control of her caucus.

“[Speaker Pelosi’s] been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party. You take a look at what’s happening in the media today. The whole party is taken over by the left and thank you very much — my poll numbers have gone up,” he said.

Of the impeachment probe, House Republican leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News that Democrats “lost their minds” and predicted it will “backfire on them” in the 2020 election.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” said McCarthy. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”"

Ever since Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, Democrats have been on a mission to reverse those results, even though it’s meant dragging the country through one desperate witch hunt after another.

Now we turn the page to the latest chapter, with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announcing “an official impeachment inquiry” stemming in part from concerns over a secondhand report of a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that neither Democrats nor apparently their source had yet even seen – and despite President Trump previously stating he would release the transcript of the call today.

I’ve heard the president both in private and repeatedly in public call for European countries to pay their fair share for NATO and for the defense of Ukraine. Having the U.S. pay less and our allies pay more has been a consistent theme of the president’s since he ran for office, and it should surprise no one that he hit on the need for Europe to play a larger role once again in the transcript he indeed released this morning.

What the transcript confirms he did not do on the call, and what much of the controversy has been about, was condition U.S. aid on Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

If the Democrats want to argue the threat is implied, well, they may want to check the stability of the moral high ground they claim to be standing on, as Democrats are guilty of the exact same behavior they want to impeach the president for.

In an op-ed for the Washington Post on Tuesday, Marc Thiessen highlighted a letter several Democrat senators sent to Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine’s prosecutor general, saying they “are writing to express great concern about reports that your office has taken steps to impede cooperation with the investigation of United States Special Counsel Robert Mueller.”

After stating, “Ours is a relationship built on a foundation of respect for the rule of law and accountable democratic institutions,” and reiterating their support for Ukraine’s “capacity-building process” regarding those ideas, they note their “disappoint[ment] that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these principles in order to avoid the ire of President Trump.”

They then write, “If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

Thiessen rightfully asks, “So, it’s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it’s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?”

Or how about instances such as Democrats pushing the Ukrainian president “not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani” and “warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington”?

We must ask some other key questions.

For one, is there really something wrong with making aid contingent on behavior? Shouldn’t it be made clear to the new Ukrainian president that our aid is contingent on them not being corrupt?

Shouldn’t we want the European Union to send their fair share of aid instead of our government taking more and more resources from the American taxpayer?

Shouldn’t we want to get to the bottom of what Ukraine knows, including lingering details from the Russia investigation?

Shouldn’t we want to know why a foreign oligarch suspected of corruption was paying the then-sitting vice president’s son $50,000 a month?

Shouldn’t we want to know why the former vice president — on video — bragged about getting the prosecutor fired who was tasked with investigating that corruption?

How is it okay for Vice President Biden or Democrat senators to threaten aid to Ukraine but somehow impeachable for a president to allegedly do so?

The fact that House Democrats and the liberal media screeched for impeachment BEFORE even knowing a thing about what did or did not happen — that tells me we are in for another partisan ride, led by people who cannot and will not concede that Donald Trump is their president.

Finally, let’s consider the question I asked at the beginning: when will it end?

Simply put, never. The transcript will not be enough. The full whistleblower complaint, which I support Congress receiving, will not be enough. Testimony from the whistleblower – even if every single employee of the national security state testified in front of Congress on any topic – would not be enough. If there’s nothing to be found here, Democrats will simply try to find something else or return to old accusations.

The hatred for the Trump presidency runs deep on the left, and hate is consuming. It’s consuming Congress’ energy and time and the American people’s patience, for starters, and it’s time for the games to stop."

Ever since Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, Democrats have been on a mission to reverse those results, even though it’s meant dragging the country through one desperate witch hunt after another.

Now we turn the page to the latest chapter, with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announcing “an official impeachment inquiry” stemming in part from concerns over a secondhand report of a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that neither Democrats nor apparently their source had yet even seen – and despite President Trump previously stating he would release the transcript of the call today.

Hawley questioned the premise, asking, “Is that what he did?”

The Missouri senator added, “He asked them for help with an election? Can you send me that?”

The HuffPost reporter then gave a printout of President Trump speaking about his July conversation with Zelensky regarding an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and that Biden threatened to withhold American foreign aid if the government did not fire the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden for allegedly corrupt business deals in Ukraine.

The HuffPost reporter then complained that the Missouri senator drew a distinction between the president asking about the government’s investigation into Hunter Biden and “asking a foreign government to help him win an election.”

“As tho [sic] those are different things,” the reporter remarked.

Sen. Hawley fired back at the HuffPost reporter, calling him out for his alleged bias against the president.

“Just admit you want to see the President impeached – and you’re willing to distort & mislead to get it done,” Hawley wrote.

Sen. Hawley then released the transcript of his interview with the HuffPost reporter, contending that leftist “reporters” will “twist words and distort facts to advance their agenda.”

“We face a crisis on the southern border, a crisis of meth pouring into our towns, a crisis of youth suicide, an epic fight with China for our jobs and maybe our national security — and the Democrats’ top priority is to … impeach @realDonaldTrump,” Hawley wrote. “Says it all.”

The U.S. Army confirmed the warning to Gizmodo on Tuesday after social media postings by suspected incels (involuntary celibates) were uncovered by the FBI.

In a September 18th email, service members were “instructed to remain aware of their surroundings and identify two escape routes when entering theaters.”

“Run if you can,” the memo read. “If you’re stuck, hide (also known as ‘sheltering in place’), and stay quiet. If a shooter finds you, fight with whatever you can.”

An Army Spokesperson told the outlet: “We do this routinely because the safety and security of our workforce are paramount. We want our workforce to be prepared and diligent on personal safety both inside the workplace and out.”

The threat of violence also evokes memories of the 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a screening of the film Batman: Dark Knight Rises, where the Joker character was a gun-wielding criminal mastermind.

The upcoming Joker film has been criticized by the relatives of those killed in a 2012 mass shooting, who wrote to Warner Bros. demanding that the company make a donation to charities supporting victims of gun violence.

“We are calling on you to be a part of the growing chorus of corporate leaders who understand that they have a social responsibility to keep us all safe,” the Survivors Empowered group wrote in a letter to company CEO Ann Sarnoff."

Barbara Boxer’s (D-CA) PAC For a Change, the Hollywood Reporter revealed Tuesday.

Boxer spoke to the Hollywood Reporter, telling the outlet that the event was inspired by The Investigation: A Search for the Truth in Ten Acts — a play that featured a slew of actors and actresses including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Sigourney Weaver, Wilson Cruz, John Lithgow, and many others.

“A West Coast version has now been set, and that’s why Boxer was on the line, to confirm the details and offer her take on why this fundraiser production is even more important in the wake of Tuesday’s news,” the Hollywood Reporter noted in an apparent reference to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) formal launch of an impeachment inquiry.

The play, which also focuses on former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report on Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, is titled You Can’t Make This Sh*t Up and features a celebrity cast including “Larry David … Tim Bagley, John Fugelsang, Tony Goldwyn, Ernie Hudson, Maz Jobrani, EJ Johnson, Josh Malina, Debra Messing, Stephanie Miller, Poppy Montgomery, Laraine Newman, Jonah Platt, Billy Porter, Paul Reiser and Katey Sagal.”

While David is taking on the role of the narrator, Messing will play the president, according to the report.

“When I was Senator for so many years, every single speech I gave always ended with me saying that it’s so critical you cared and you’re here. So, it’s particularly gratifying to me to see people who stand to have something to lose,” Boxer told the Hollywood Reporter.

“In the case of incredibly talented and gifted performers in this show, when they come out and say they are willing to do this, to me, it means a lot. They have more to lose from it. I am so gratified and grateful to them for wiling to make a difference,” she added.

Boxer noted that she “read every word of the Mueller report,” adding, “it’s very dry, but it shows the president attempting to obstruct justice 11 different times.”

“In this particular production, it’s so funny because Hirsch is such an incredible writer. She added a narrator [David] and there’s so much commentary from that part all the way through which will make it that much funnier,” she added.

As Breitbart News has extensively reported, the Mueller report did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Mueller did not recommend charging the president with obstruction of justice.

Hollywood’s rehash of the Mueller investigation follows the Democrat-led House effort to impeach Trump, with Pelosi caving to the far-left flank of her caucus and formally announcing an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Democrats largely cited the so-called whistleblower complaint as the leading reason to actively pursue impeachment this week. Trump authorized the release the transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which — as several Republican lawmakers pointed out — showed no “pressure,” quid pro quo, or violation of law.

Despite that, Boxer says the play’s timing “could not be more opportune.”

“If this impeachment is successful, at this point, I don’t see many badges of courage on the other side of the aisle. The only way to remove him from office is through an election, so it’s important to gather and get together,” she told the Hollywood Reporter.

“The timing of this couldn’t be any more opportune. I hope everyone buys a ticket and brings a friend and reaches out to the younger generation,” Boxer said. “We will take any donation — large or small — and use it to give free tickets to those who can’t afford to come.”"

The toy company introduced a line of 29 dolls called “Creatable World,” which comes in different kits with hair, clothing, and other accessory options depending on whether the kit is more masculine or feminine. The dolls come in at a suggested retail price of $30.

“Toys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,” Kim Culmone, senior vice president of Mattel Fashion Doll Design, said in a statement. “Through research, we heard that kids don’t want their toys dictated by gender norms.”

When the company rolled out the dolls, Mattel toned down typically masculine and feminine features and featured kits addressed with the pronoun “they” and the slogan “A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in.”

Mattel said the dolls are available at big-box retailers such as Target, Walmart, and Amazon."

In February, Mattel introduced dolls with braided hair texture, a different body type, and Barbie dolls that have physical disabilities.

LGBT activist group GLAAD praised the new line of dolls intended to reflect gender ideology, which asserts biological sex is subservient to gender identity.

“Mattel’s new line of gender inclusive dolls encourages children to be their authentic selves and is the latest sign that toys and media aimed at kids are expanding to reflect how diverse children and their families actually are,” said Rich Ferraro, GLAAD’s chief communications officer, reported ABC News. “So many children and parents never saw themselves represented in toys and dolls, but this new line raises the bar for inclusion thanks to input from parents, physicians and children themselves.”"

The Washington Post Magazine said Planned Parenthood has advised the entertainment industry on more than 150 productions since 2014, citing estimates provided by a director at the nonprofit.

“Nobody used to call me,” Caren Spruch, Planned Parenthood’s director of arts and entertainment engagement, told the Post. “I would be watching TV and going to the movies and figuring out who I thought might be open to including these story lines. Now I have a couple of repeat clients. Now people call me.”

The report noted that Planned Parenthood has advised productions including the 2014 romantic comedy Obvious Child, which features an abortion subplot, as well as the TV shows Shrill and Jane the Virgin.

“If there’s a word or two that isn’t entirely accurate, she [Spruch] helps me drill down on that and make sure that we’re not putting misinformation out there,” said Jennie Snyder Urman, the show runner of Jane the Virgin.

Spruch encourages screenwriters to discuss abortion or works as a script doctor for screenwriters interested incorporating abortion, birth control or sexually transmitted infections in their storylines, according to the report.

The article recounts how Spruch arrived at Planned Parenthood in 1989 as a senior field organizer. She began courting youth through tactics like handing out information at concerts by Santana and Dave Matthews Band.

At one point, she cornered Maggie Gyllenhaal after spotting the actress in the audience of a play at the Public Theater in New York.

“She’s been a hardcore activist ever since,” Spruch said in the article.

Planned Parenthood sees Hollywood as a way of spreading its message to a wide audience.

“A lot of people learn about sexual and reproductive health care through pop culture and entertainment programs,” Melanie Roussell Newman, Planned Parenthood’s senior vice president of communication and culture, told the Post.

“We’ve seen pop culture change views around LGBTQ issues, for example, and pop culture has the power to challenge abortion stigma, too.”

The Post article includes comments from pro-life activists, some of whom object to Planned Parenthood’s influence over the entertainment industry.

“It’s like the tobacco industry getting to fact-check how smoking is treated in films,” Lila Rose, founder of Live Action, told the Post.

In July, the New York Times reported that Hollywood is depicting abortions at “record levels” on TV and in film in 2019.

The Washington Post Magazine said Planned Parenthood has advised the entertainment industry on more than 150 productions since 2014, citing estimates provided by a director at the nonprofit.

“Nobody used to call me,” Caren Spruch, Planned Parenthood’s director of arts and entertainment engagement, told the Post. “I would be watching TV and going to the movies and figuring out who I thought might be open to including these story lines. Now I have a couple of repeat clients. Now people call me.”

The report noted that Planned Parenthood has advised productions including the 2014 romantic comedy Obvious Child, which features an abortion subplot, as well as the TV shows Shrill and Jane the Virgin.

“If there’s a word or two that isn’t entirely accurate, she [Spruch] helps me drill down on that and make sure that we’re not putting misinformation out there,” said Jennie Snyder Urman, the show runner of Jane the Virgin.

The younger Biden, who has a history of getting rich from entities tied to his father, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the former vice president has attempted to paint the issue as an abuse of power on Trump’s part, many have noted the unanswered questions surrounding his son’s tenure at Burisma points to serious conflict of interests, if not outright corruption.

The most prominent and perplexing question is how and why Hunter Biden was appointed to the company’s board of directors in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company’s board of directors.

At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden’s lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden’s ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father’s position as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

The poor optics not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden’s own business partners. Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma.

More troubling, however, is an episode that took place in 2016, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the country’s top prosecutor.

Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if Shokin was not fired came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor’s abilities to root out corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing. Regardless of the reason, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son’s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump’s alleged misuse of power.

The former vice president’s claim, though, directly contradicts his son’s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do,’” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

Since making his initial statement in Iowa, Joe Biden has reverted back to his long held position of refusing to discuss his son’s dealings publicly. The silence has left a lot of unanswered questions about Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.

“Again the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight. “These entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He’s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that’s what needs to be investigated.”

The question is all the more important given Hunter Biden’s history of profiting from his father’s political connections. As Breitbart News reported, the younger Biden scored a job fresh out of law school with his father’s top campaign contributor. In 1996, Hunter Biden was hired for an undisclosed position with MBNA, which at the time was one of the nation’s largest credit card companies.

The job raised eyebrows from good government groups as MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations. Hunter Biden would continue working for MBNA in one capacity or another until the mid-2000s, while his father was writing bankruptcy legislation favored by the company."

“The Democrats, they went down to see the president of Ukraine and they asked him for all sorts of things,” Trump said, noting that Democrats urged Ukrainians not to cooperate with Republicans and remain aligned with the Democrats as if it was a “political war.”

U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to the Ukrainian government in May 2018, urging them to cooperate with investigators in the Russia investigation and the investigation of President Donald Trump.

“They shouldn’t have done that,” Trump said. “That should be an impeachable event … tremendous pressure on Ukraine.”

Trump noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement saying that the president put no pressure on him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption.

He again argued that he halted foreign aid to Ukraine to see if other countries would help Ukraine with defense aid, and condemned the Democrat’s impeachment process as the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.”

After releasing a transcript of the call, Trump said that the conversation was proven “friendly.”

“There was no pressure. The way you had that built up, that call, it was going to be the call from hell,” he said. “It turned out to be a nothing call.”

The call transcript confirmed that Trump asked Zelensky about a possible investigation into Biden and his son for their actions in Ukraine.

Trump accused the establishment media for fueling the ongoing controversy over his phone call after a whistleblower raised concerns about the content of the call based on second-hand information.

“So, part of the problem you have is you have the fake news,” he said. “You have a lot of corrupt reporting, there’s some very fine reporters and journalists, but you have a lot of corrupt reporters, a lot of corrupt journalists.”"

“It is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath,” Biden said in a lengthy statement following the White House’s release of the July 25th conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“The 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it,” he continued.

According to the transcript, President Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden’s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, an energy firm where his son Hunter was a board member. The former vice president bragged about the prosecutor’s ouster before the Council of Foreign Relations last year, saying that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the investigator was removed.

Numerous congressional Democrats expressed support for impeachment after the call between President Trump and Zelensky came to light, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to formally launch an impeachment inquiry.

Though Biden did not mention impeachment in his statement, the presidential candidate said he supports Democrats’ efforts to help the president “accountable.”

“Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,” he said. “In the meantime, I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America’s families.”

During a joint press conference at the United Nations Wednesday, Zelensky denied that President Trump pressed him to probe Hunter Biden.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” he said.

When it was President Trump’s time to speak, he maintained that he applied “no pressure whatsoever” on Ukraine.

“Part of the problem you have is you have the fake news, you have a lot of corrupt reporting,” Trump added, once again denouncing the Ukraine call as “the single greatest witch hunt in American history.”"

Joshua Johnson, host of 1A, discussed the White House’s release of the transcript of a July conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, following Democrats’ decision to move ahead with an impeachment inquiry against Trump on Tuesday. He was joined by Financial Times journalist Edward Luce and by Southern Methodist University presidential historian Jeff Engel.

At one point, Johnson asked whether there was merit to Democrats’ suspicion that Trump supporters would not care about the evidence:

I don’t think that it is inaccurate to say that some Democrats would rather focus on 2020 because they believe that the president’s base is unshakeable, that they will support him no matter what, and that whatever comes out of this impeachment inquiry, that they are solidly set on re-electing Donald Trump. I also don’t think that hyperbole would be overstating it to say that some Democrats just think that the president’s base is too dumb to know the difference, that they wouldn’t get — even if all of the evidence pointed toward impeachment, pointed toward this being someone who needed to be removed, that the president has fooled enough people, that they are so gullible, that they will not vote against him no matter what. That’s the vibe I get from some Democrats — that this whole thing is a waste of time, because “those people” are going to pick him no matter what.

Luce replied: “There’s a pretty good case to be made for that argument … There is a bedrock of support that, as Trump said, he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, they’d still vote for him.” He added: “Whether that means they’re gullible or not, I don’t know.”

Engel said that Trump’s supporters might not believe evidence against the president that otherwise seemed plain because people were less trusting of news. “We are living in a much different truth environment” than during the era of President Richard M. Nixon, who resigned before he could be impeached during the Watergate scandal, he said.

He explained that people might not believe evidence against Trump even if they saw or heard it themselves because they were less trusting of news and because video or audio evidence will be more manipulable in the near future.

Pelosi noted that the House passed universal background checks over 200 days ago, then said, “Every day since then, on average, 100 people are killed by gun violence, 47 of them children or teenagers.”

She is getting her figure of 100 firearm-related deaths from 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers. Those showed 39,773 deaths, which CNN reported as the highest level of firearm-related deaths in 40 years.

Pelosi seized on that high level and now claims “100 people killed by gun violence,” on average, each day.

However, the truth is that 66 percent of those who die in a firearm-related death do so via suicide, not “gun violence.” Actually gun violence deaths normally range somewhere between 11,000 and 11,500 or 11,000 and 12,000 a year.

We saw this same tactic used when Hillary Clinton was running for president. She claimed “90 people a day die from gun violence” when, in reality, 66 percent of deaths were suicides.

And while the left tends to push more gun control as a way to reduce suicides, the Chicago Tribune‘s Steve Chapman notes that suicides in stringently gun-controlled Japan are far higher than those in gun-friendly U.S.A. Because of this, Chapman contends that more gun control is not the solution.

Pelosi noted that the House passed universal background checks over 200 days ago, then said, “Every day since then, on average, 100 people are killed by gun violence, 47 of them children or teenagers.”

She is getting her figure of 100 firearm-related deaths from 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers. Those showed 39,773 deaths, which CNN reported as the highest level of firearm-related deaths in 40 years.

Pelosi seized on that high level and now claims “100 people killed by gun violence,” on average, each day.

However, the truth is that 66 percent of those who die in a firearm-related death do so via suicide, not “gun violence.” Actually gun violence deaths normally range somewhere between 11,000 and 11,500 or 11,000 and 12,000 a year.

We saw this same tactic used when Hillary Clinton was running for president. She claimed “90 people a day die from gun violence” when, in reality, 66 percent of deaths were suicides.

And while the left tends to push more gun control as a way to reduce suicides, the Chicago Tribune‘s Steve Chapman notes that suicides in stringently gun-controlled Japan are far higher than those in gun-friendly U.S.A. Because of this, Chapman contends that more gun control is not the solution.

But, you would have a hard time convincing this police horse that hooliganism has disappeared.

Things got ugly in the streets after a game between Portsmouth and Southampton on Tuesday. It’s unclear what started the fracas, but what is clear to see on the viral video is a fan punching a police horse.

“Yo yo yo! My man’s swinging for a horse!” the fan can be heard screaming in the video.

Watch:

Unfortunately for his assailant, the horse had a remarkable jaw and took the punch quite well. In fact, he barely looked fazed as he quickly recovered and chased the man down the street before his two-legged colleagues arrived and exacted revenge.

Yahoo! reported that a 52-year-old man had been arrested on charges of animal cruelty.

Though, it appears more damage was done to the horse puncher, as opposed to the horse. Moral of the story: Don’t punch horses people, especially police horses.

Southampton won the game, 4-0.

The meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz has concluded. In a short time, the responsibility for forming the government will be given to Benjamin Netanyahu, after which President Rivlin and Prime Minister Netanyahu will give remarks. — Reuven Rivlin (@PresidentRuvi) September 25, 2019

The center-left Blue and White party of Benny Gantz won 33 seats to the conservative Likud’s 32 seats in the elections last week — the country’s second last year after the small, secular nationalist Yisraeli Beiteinu party of Avigdor Lieberman refused to serve in Netanyahu’s coalition with religious parties. The election produced a stalemate in which neither the left-wing bloc around Blue and White (54 seats) nor the right-wing bloc around Likud (55 seats) had enough seats to form a governing majority in Israel’s 120-seat Knesset. Lieberman held the balance and insisted on a unity government that included both of the two major parties. Netanyahu agreed, and offered Gantz a power-sharing deal. He reiterated that offer today upon being tasked with forming a government.

But Gantz refused to serve under Netanyahu in any capacity — even temporarily as part of a rotating prime ministership — because Netanyahu is facing indictment for charges that critics say are partisan and meritless.

Gantz’s refusal may also be strategic. Knowing that Netanyahu will struggle to build a coalition with Lieberman, and that the other, smaller parties (left-wing parties and Arab parties) are likely to refuse to govern with him, the possibility exists that Netanyahu will fail to form a coalition by the 28-day deadline (with a two-week extension).

In that case, Gantz himself might have a chance to form a government — or the country would go to elections for a third time this year, an unprecedented situation that Rivlin has urged all parties to work together to avoid.

It is also possible that Gantz has miscalculated by rejecting unity, denying his voters a chance to be represented in the next government, and giving Netanyahu a chance to save both his government and his career by trying again.

Trump accused China of severe intellectual property theft and global fraud in continuing to declare itself a “developing nation” despite being the world’s second-largest economy. He also offered a message of hope to the pro-democracy protesters challenging Beijing in Hong Kong, pressing the Communist Party to stop attempting to override the legal agreement that keeps Hong Kong capitalist.

“Trump’s ‘America First’ speech was widely deemed as a nationalist speech with low-energy delivery,” the People’s Daily claimed. “His speech is another example of Trump ‘gaming’ the facts to fit his narrative about the rise of China.”

The newspaper accused Trump of ignoring how communism is “making China great again” and of incorrectly blaming China for mass deindustrialization in the United States, which it instead claimed was the result of “rational economic behavior … largely driven by market forces.”

“China’s achievements derive from the hard work of the Chinese people and the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, and sweat and even tears are behind China’s rise to greatness,” the People’s Daily declared.

Blaming China’s distortion of its economic reality to benefit from globalization at the expense of the United States, the People’s Daily argued, was “a stretch of the imagination.”

“A lie told a thousand times does not become truth. The model that China has embraced values globalization, reform, and opening to the world,” the propaganda outlet asserted. “China plays by the rules of the WTO and other international multilateral organizations, which were mostly designed by the West.”

“We should understand that China and the United States are different. They have different histories, different cultures, different political systems, and different development path,” the newspaper insisted. “The key to harmony is how to correctly understand and handle them.”

The People’s Daily recommended that “if Trump is serious about fixing America,” he should stop “bullying” China by pointing out its outrageous intellectual property theft and unethical economic policies.

In his speech before fellow world leaders in New York on Tuesday, Trump noted that “the most important difference” between his administration’s policies and those of his predecessors is his realistic approach to China. The entry of China into the World Trade Organization as a developing country, he noted, was a move intended to “compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us, and for private property and for the rule of law.”

The theory that including China in global trade as a communist nation would liberalize it “has been tested and proven completely wrong,” Trump asserted.

“Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,” the president said.

Trump went on to warn China to “honor its binding treaty” with Hong Kong and protect its “freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life.” The Chinese government, through its proxies running Hong Kong, have actively attempted to crush those institutions – first through the attempted imposition of a law allowing the communists to extradite political dissidents, and later with police brutality against those who dared protest the law. Trump once again reminded the world that the violence against protesters was on the back of Communist Party dictator Xi Jinping – who has refused to publicly remark on the matter – urging him to act as a “great leader” and not violate the rights of the protesters.

In addition to the outrage from the People’s Daily, the Chinese regime formally disparaged Trump’s remarks as “false” through its foreign ministry. Spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed the veracity of Trump’s speech and added, “The U.S. should look at China’s development with an open, inclusive and win-win mentality and meet China halfway.” He also directed reporters to remarks by Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also in New York to address the General Assembly.

“Seeking hegemony has never been in the Chinese DNA. China has no intention of playing a ‘game of thrones’ on the world stage,” Wang said on Tuesday.

“On the claim that US policy has failed to change China and that it’s time to revert to a containment policy, Wang said that the idea of molding others according to one’s wish is wrong and will never work. Seventy years on, it is important for the US to avoid picking another wrong fight with the wrong country,” the Global Times, another government propaganda outlet, quoted Wang as saying.

General Assembly speech Wednesday, accusing neighboring dictator Nicolás Maduro of aiding drug traffickers, terrorists, “murderers, and child rapists.”

Duque compared Maduro to genocidal Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and announced he would hand over a dossier of evidence to the head of the General Assembly proving that Maduro is harboring Marxist terrorists belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) that are engaged in an ongoing war against the Colombian government.

Entregamos a #ONU pruebas de complicidad de Nicolás Maduro con terroristas que atentan contra pueblo colombiano. Presentamos a cerca de 20 criminales que traicionaron generosidad de Colombia y están en Venezuela. También ubicación de 1.400 hombres de Eln, campamentos y pistas. pic.twitter.com/PPN388Ksm1 — Iván Duque (@IvanDuque) September 25, 2019

Duque acknowledged that some members of the FARC have laid down their weapons as part of a 2016 peace deal that preceded Duque, and granted the terrorist group multiple uncontested seats in the Colombian Congress. Given the existence of the deal, he noted, “these groups have not enjoyed the fruits of reintegration or disarmament simply because they chose not to.”

“A group of narco-terrorists sought to intimidate Colombia hiding behind claims of ideological goals, but the reality is that these groups have not enjoyed the fruits of reintegration or disarmament because they simply chose not to,” Duque told the General Assembly. “They have not left behind their life of crime, they have lied to Colombia and Colombians, and they have aligned themselves with a dictatorship that is repressing its people in Venezuela.”

The terrorists have “found themselves resisted by a people that will not be cowered …. let there be no room for doubt, I will use all tools available to me so that Colombia enjoys peace,” Duque warned the terrorists.

Duque appeared to be addressing two main FARC terror leaders directly, “Jesús Santrich” and “Iván Márquez,” who the Colombian government gave Senate seats to before they defected to Venezuela and announced a new civil war against Bogotá. Maduro and his cronies have insisted they have “nothing to do” with the FARC war, but Duque insisted otherwise on Wednesday.

“The Venezuelan dictatorship is one more link in the chain of transnational terrorism. Its corrupt structures are the handmaidens of drug cartels,” Duque affirmed. “Its followers are adherents of a mafia and fuel the violence in Colombia. The dictatorship gives refuge to murderers and child rapists – and those who ignore these facts are, by their silence, accomplices of the dictatorship.”

The FARC is over a century old and has for nearly just as much time been guilty of abducting children to use as soldiers. Girls forced into terrorism often fall prey to rapist terrorists, and are later forced into unwanted abortions to keep from slowing down terror cells with babies. One FARC abortionist arrested was believed to be responsible for as many as 500 murders of unborn children.

“My government has credible and resounding proof that corroborates the support lent by the Venezuelan dictatorship to criminal and drug trafficking groups that are operating in Venezuela and assume activities in Colombia as a assault on our nationhood,” Duque said, displaying a thick dossier that he promised to hand over to the president of the General Assembly.

Duque also addressed the damage that Maduro has done to his own country, not just Colombia.

“Since 2015, at least 4.2 million people have fled Venezuela. They flee from a nation that was wealthy and is now in the abyss, that cannot feed its people,” the Colombian president said. “That was a flourishing democracy and is now an authoritarian regime that is now without a free media … its citizens have no choice but to jump ship.”

Duque affirmed that Colombia does not recognize Maduro’s legitimacy, but that of constitutionally appointed interim President Juan Guaidó, along with over 50 other nations, most in Latin America.

“We adopt this stance driven by the need we see for the Venezuelan people to have their democracy restored,” Duque said. “The Venezuelan tragedy has a name and we all know what that name is.”

Duque said that Maduro’s human rights abuses “can be justifiably compared to the crimes of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia,” who was tried before an international tribunal for genocide following a vicious campaign to eradicate non-Serbian people from Bosnia.

“We cannot sit by idly watching,” Duque urged. “Venezuela needs the urgent convening of genuinely free and fair elections and it needs the full restoration of the rule of law.”

General Assembly against the United States and its allies, with a constant drumbeat of threats that regional “peace” and “stability” can only be achieved by meeting Iranian demands.

Some of these threats were directed at the European Union, which has not provided Iran with the benefits it expected in exchange for remaining in the nuclear deal.

Rouhani complained about “terrorist strikes and bombardments in Yemen, Syria, occupied Palestine, Afghanistan, and other countries of the world, including Iraq.”

In other words, Rouhani was accusing the United States and its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, of terrorism in an effort to deflect allegations of Iranian military aggression and support for terrorism. Later he called the United States a “warmonger” that should be punished for “leveling allegations and grudges” against “innocent” nations such as Iran and accused the U.S. of supporting ISIS and other terrorist organizations.

Rouhani said the Middle East is “burning in the flames of war, bloodshed, aggression, occupation, and religious and sectarian fanaticism and extremism,” with the “suppressed people of Palestine” as the “biggest victims.”

“Discrimination, appropriation of lands, settlement expansions, and killings continue to be practiced against the Palestinians,” he charged, predicting that “U.S. and Zionist plans” for the Palestinian territories are “certainly doomed.”

Rouhani claimed Iran’s “regional and international assistance and cooperation on security and counterterrorism,” exemplified by Iran’s alliance with Russia and Turkey in Syria, have been “decisive” against the “destructive plans” of the United States.

“I hail from a country that has resisted the most merciless economic terrorism and has defended its rights to independence and science and technology development,” the Iranian president said.

“The U.S. government, while imposing extraterritorial sanctions and threats against other nations, has made a lot of efforts to deprive Iran of the advantages of participating in the global economy, and has resorted to international piracy by misusing the international banking system,” he alleged.

“We Iranians have been the pioneers of freedom-seeking movements in the region, while seeking peace and progress for our nation as well as our neighbors,” Rouhani claimed.

“We have never surrendered to foreign aggression and imposition. We cannot believe the invitation to negotiation of people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions in history against the dignity and prosperity of our nation,” he said, restating several times that his regime does not view the current U.S. government as a trustworthy negotiating partner.

Rouhani accused “criminal” U.S. officials of pursuing sanctions in an “addictive manner” against a range of ostensibly innocent countries such as Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, China, and Russia.

He said the sanctions are harming “83 million Iranians, particularly women and children,” although later he also claimed that the sanctions have had little negative effect on Iran’s economic and social development.

“The attitude of the incumbent U.S. government towards the nuclear deal, or JCPOA, not only violates the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, but also constitutes a breach of the sovereignty and political and economic independence of all of the world’s countries,” he argued.

“In spite of the American withdrawal from the JCPOA, for one year Iran remained fully faithful to all of its nuclear commitments in accordance with the JCPOA. Out of respect for the Security Council resolution, we provided Europe with the opportunity to fulfill its 11 commitments, made to compensate for the U.S. withdrawal. However, unfortunately, we only heard beautiful words while witnessing no effective measures,” he said.

Rouhani threatened Europe by saying Iran’s “patience has a limit” and it has almost been reached with respect to Europe’s “inability” to give Tehran what it wants. He implied that Iran’s national “dignity” would therefore compel it to begin violating the JCPOA in increasingly broad ways.

“On behalf of my nation and state, I would like to announce that our response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative,” he said.

“The government and people of Iran have remained steadfast against the harshest sanctions in the past one and a half years, and will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty, pressure, and sanctions,” he declared.

“The only way for talks to begin is to return to commitments and compliance. If you are sensitive to the name of ‘JCPOA,’ well then, you can return to its framework and abide by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations,” he said.

Rouhani suggested Iran might be willing to “give more” if the Western world agrees to “pay more” in a revised nuclear deal, although he did not detail either his offers or demands.

Rouhani claimed Iran is interested in maintaining “the peace and stability of the Persian Gulf, and providing freedom of navigation and safety of movement in the Strait of Hormuz.”

He lamented that “recent incidents have endangered such security” and suggested the “umbrella” of safe passage could only be restored if all regional countries joined a “Coalition of Hope” that would respect Iran’s needs as well. This coalition would pointedly exclude all powers outside the Middle East and would obstruct the deployment of foreign naval vessels to secure the freedom of navigation.

“The security of our region shall be provided when American troops pull out. Security shall not be supplied with American weapons and intervention,” Rouhani said explicitly.

“The United States, after 18 years, has failed to reduce acts of terrorism. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran managed to terminate the scourge of Daesh with the assistance of neighboring nations and governments,” he claimed, using another name for the Islamic State (and grievously insulting the U.S.-supported Kurdish forces who did much of the fighting against ISIS).

“The ultimate way towards peace and security in the Middle East passes through inward democracy and outward diplomacy,” he said. “Security cannot be purchased or supplied by foreign governments … America is not our neighbor.”

“The security of Saudi Arabia shall be guaranteed with the termination of aggression towards Yemen,” Rouhani said, effectively telling the Saudis they can halt Iranian attacks on their oil fields by surrendering control of Yemen to Iranian proxies."

General Assembly against the United States and its allies, with a constant drumbeat of threats that regional “peace” and “stability” can only be achieved by meeting Iranian demands.

Some of these threats were directed at the European Union, which has not provided Iran with the benefits it expected in exchange for remaining in the nuclear deal.

Rouhani complained about “terrorist strikes and bombardments in Yemen, Syria, occupied Palestine, Afghanistan, and other countries of the world, including Iraq.”

In other words, Rouhani was accusing the United States and its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, of terrorism in an effort to deflect allegations of Iranian military aggression and support for terrorism. Later he called the United States a “warmonger” that should be punished for “leveling allegations and grudges” against “innocent” nations such as Iran and accused the U.S. of supporting ISIS and other terrorist organizations.

Rouhani said the Middle East is “burning in the flames of war, bloodshed, aggression, occupation, and religious and sectarian fanaticism and extremism,” with the “suppressed people of Palestine” as the “biggest victims.”

“Discrimination, appropriation of lands, settlement expansions, and killings continue to be practiced against the Palestinians,” he charged, predicting that “U.S. and Zionist plans” for the Palestinian territories are “certainly doomed.”

Rouhani claimed Iran’s “regional and international assistance and cooperation on security and counterterrorism,” exemplified by Iran’s alliance with Russia and Turkey in Syria, have been “decisive” against the “destructive plans” of the United States.

“I hail from a country that has resisted the most merciless economic terrorism and has defended its rights to independence and science and technology development,” the Iranian president said.

“The U.S. government, while imposing extraterritorial sanctions and threats against other nations, has made a lot of efforts to deprive Iran of the advantages of participating in the global economy, and has resorted to international piracy by misusing the international banking system,” he alleged.

“We Iranians have been the pioneers of freedom-seeking movements in the region, while seeking peace and progress for our nation as well as our neighbors,” Rouhani claimed.

“We have never surrendered to foreign aggression and imposition. We cannot believe the invitation to negotiation of people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions in history against the dignity and prosperity of our nation,” he said, restating several times that his regime does not view the current U.S. government as a trustworthy negotiating partner.

Rouhani accused “criminal” U.S. officials of pursuing sanctions in an “addictive manner” against a range of ostensibly innocent countries such as Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, China, and Russia.

He said the sanctions are harming “83 million Iranians, particularly women and children,” although later he also claimed that the sanctions have had little negative effect on Iran’s economic and social development.

“The attitude of the incumbent U.S. government towards the nuclear deal, or JCPOA, not only violates the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, but also constitutes a breach of the sovereignty and political and economic independence of all of the world’s countries,” he argued.

“In spite of the American withdrawal from the JCPOA, for one year Iran remained fully faithful to all of its nuclear commitments in accordance with the JCPOA. Out of respect for the Security Council resolution, we provided Europe with the opportunity to fulfill its 11 commitments, made to compensate for the U.S. withdrawal. However, unfortunately, we only heard beautiful words while witnessing no effective measures,” he said.

Rouhani threatened Europe by saying Iran’s “patience has a limit” and it has almost been reached with respect to Europe’s “inability” to give Tehran what it wants. He implied that Iran’s national “dignity” would therefore compel it to begin violating the JCPOA in increasingly broad ways.

“On behalf of my nation and state, I would like to announce that our response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative,” he said.

The socialist strongman, who took power in 2006 and remains one of the region’s longest-lasting left-wing governments, argued that the world’s financial system “remains undemocratic, unequal, and unstable, all while supporting tax havens and banking cartels that force smaller countries to accept punitive measures to maintain their existence.”

“It fills us with sadness that these social inequalities still exist,” he said. “According to data from Oxfam, 1.3 billion people live in poverty, while one percent of the richest hold 82 percent of the world’s wealth.”

Morales went on to blame the capitalist system on the “global oligarchy,” in which a “handful of millionaires are defining the economic and political destiny of humanity.”

“That 26 people have the same wealth as 3.8 billion people is unfair, immoral, and unacceptable,” he declared. “The core issue lies within the model of production and consumerism, the private ownership of natural resources and in the unequal distribution of wealth. I say this with absolute clarity: the core of the issue is capitalism.”

Morales also addressed ongoing concerns over the Amazon rainforest, with both he and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro facing intense scrutiny for their responses to a spate of recent wildfires.

“Our house, mother Earth, is our only home, and it is irreplaceable,” he said. “In recent weeks we have seen focal points for heat [in the Amazon rainforest] … We are fighting these fires using our financial resources. To date, our country has spent over 15 million dollars in order to put out the fires.”

The 59-year-old strongman, who rose to power with the support of many of Bolivia’s indigenous peoples, has in recent years taken various steps to consolidate his power and turn the country into a socialist state.

Some of his measures include the scrapping of term limits, reforms to the judicial system, the imprisonment of political opponents, and the realignment of the country’s foreign policy towards closer relationships with Latin American leftist regimes such as Cuba and Venezuela, as well as authoritarian regimes further afield such as Iran, China, and Syria.

“The administration of President Evo Morales has created a hostile environment for human rights defenders that undermines their ability to work independently,” notes the human rights campaign group Human Rights Watch. “A judicial reform that began in 2016 risks seriously weakening the rule of law in the country.”

“Extensive and arbitrary use of pretrial detention—and long trial delays—undermine defendants’ rights and contribute to prison overcrowding,” adds the organization. “Impunity for past human rights abuses, violence against women, and child labor are other major concerns.”

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that Democrats’ decision to launch an official impeachment inquiry is proof they have “lost their minds” and expects the decision “will backfire on them in 2020” in key elections.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” McCarthy said in an emailed statement provided exclusively to Breitbart News on Wednesday afternoon. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”

McCarthy added that he sees no other outcome here other than the Democrats paying a serious political price for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to cave in to the far left of her conference and move forward on impeachment despite not having a clear reason to do so.

“America is too great to be led by a vision so small — I’m 100 percent confident Democrats obsession with impeachment will backfire on them in 2020,” McCarthy said.

McCarthy’s statement comes after Pelosi announced Tuesday that Democrats are now officially moving forward with an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a decision she made before seeing the transcript of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump was alleged by a supposed “whistleblower” in the intelligence community to have engaged in a quid pro quo where he threatened to withhold U.S. taxpayer aid to Ukraine in exchange for forcing Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, the one-time now-former Democrat 2020 presidential front runner.

But Trump on Wednesday released the transcript of the phone call with Zelensky, which shows there was no such quid pro quo. The transcript shows Trump did broach the subject of Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and the former Vice President’s efforts while in office to pressure the Ukrainian government to terminate a government prosecutor investigating his son’s company. But in the transcript, the new Ukrainian president Zelensky agrees with Trump and says he is planning to investigate the Biden scandal.

Unlike Pelosi’s move to announce an impeachment push without seeing any evidence, McCarthy’s statement to Breitbart News was issued after the transcript was released publicly. It confirms previous Breitbart News reporting that Democrats are reeling and disjointed, rudderless without a clear and concise message, while Republicans are preparing for the upcoming 2020 elections in which the GOP is now clearly emboldened after the Democrats made the remarkable move to proceed with impeachment.

Privately, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed concerns about the lack of a focus on the impeachment move; without a clear outcome in mind, Democrats fear that whatever happens will further energize Trump ahead of the 2020 election while failing to remove him.

“If you’re going to take a shot at the king, you best not miss,” one House Democrat leadership aide told Breitbart News. “And we do not have a pathway to win without 20 GOP votes in the Senate. We are nowhere near that, not even close.”

Another senior Democrat congressional aide added regarding the move to attempt to impeach Trump: “It’s a joke. It’s all bullshit.”

Over on the Senate side, most Republicans are in line with Trump. While Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said that he considers the transcript’s contents “troubling,” he declined to discuss “impeachment” at this time.

“The Democrats are fucked,” a senior Senate GOP aide told Breitbart News upon reviewing the transcript. “This is going to unite everyone except maybe Mitt, I bet even Ben Sasse comes around on this and backs the president unless there’s some bombshell with the whistleblower who didn’t even hear this call. Republican operatives I’ve talked to are giddy about this.”

Republican senators were publicly backing Trump by lunchtime on Wednesday:

Grassley: “no quid pro quo you have to have that to have done anything wrong” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

GOP Sen. Capito in Trump transcript: “I don’t think it rises to the level of an impeachable offense at all. I was expecting much more from the pre-reports. It sounded like the president” “Much, much, much less hysterical than what we were led to believe” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

Tillis: “Nancy Pelosi should be embarrassed. The transcript debunks the Democrats’ false claims against President Trump and demonstrates that their call to impeach him is a total farce.” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

Even Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) would not use the word “impeachment” when talking about the Democrat Party’s decision to try to take out the president of the United States.

Manchin statement on impeachment doesn’t mention impeachment “Any allegation of misconduct with a foreign country must be investigated. I firmly believe it is premature to jump to any conclusion until an investigation of the facts is complete.” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

The Senate GOP aide pointed to “deafening silence” from red state Democrat state parties, looking throughout the south and heartland noting that Democrat party officials outside D.C. are not standing with their party’s leadership in Washington now. The aide also noted that Pelosi has gotten desperate.

“She threw a Hail Mary without waiting to see the transcript,” the Senate GOP aide said. “They should have held off a few days.”

Looking across the country, Republicans nationwide are energized in candidate recruitment in battleground districts where they are seeking credible challengers to vulnerable Democrats. While some potential GOP candidates were watching and waiting on the sidelines, not sure if they would run for Congress now or wait until a future election when they think their chances might be better, at least two executive directors from state GOP committees in two 2020 battleground states with vulnerable House Democrats up for re-election have told Breitbart News in the last 24 hours there has been a surge of interest from potential credible candidates seeking to oust the Democrats from the House majority.

What’s more, candidates in battleground districts across America who are already running are emboldened. Teddy Daniels, a Republican and wounded warrior veteran running against Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA)–who just backed impeachment this week–in the deeply pro-Trump eighth district in Pennsylvania, ripped Cartwright for caving to the left while not solving problems for the constituents in his district.

“Radical leftist Matt Cartwright and the Democrats want to overturn the will of the American people who legitimately elected President Trump in 2016,” Daniels told Breitbart News in an email. “They want to use witch hunts and the impeachment process to bring about their wild and crazy socialist, anti-2nd Amendment and open borders agenda that nobody wants.”

National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Michael McAdams piled on Cartwright too.

“In a district President Trump won by ten points, Matt Cartwright has decided to stand with the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the socialist Democrats rather than Pennsylvania voters,” McAdams said.

Pennsylvania’s 8th congressional district is one of the 13 districts a Democrat currently represents where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 6 percent–Trump won by 10 points there–in 2016. There are another 18 districts, for 31 total pro-Trump districts currently represented by Democrats, where Trump beat Clinton in the last election.

To retake the majority in 2020, Republicans only need to win back a net gain of 19 seats next year–and now that the Democrats have abandoned the possibility of passing any legislation whatsoever on things like infrastructure, prescription drug pricing, healthcare, the economy, jobs, guns, in favor of impeachment, Republicans feel like the Democrats have given them a messaging gift going into 2020.

McCarthy, for an hour-long exclusive interview that aired on Breitbart News radio in early August, laid out the GOP plan to retake the House majority with these 31 districts at the forefront of the effort.

“There are 31 seats that Democrats sit in today that President Trump carried,” McCarthy said. “Of those 31, 13 of them President Trump carried by more than six points. So, here you have the socialist wing of the party trying to take them further left, when the only way they have the majority is actually winning in Republican areas—areas that would be swing districts.”

Republicans were confident then, going into the August recess. But these efforts, thanks to the Democrats’ decision in the words of one GOP aide to “jump the shark completely now” with moving on impeachment proceedings, have now been supercharged this week.

In another of those 13 super pro-Trump districts that the president won by more than 6 percent, New Mexico’s second district, incumbent freshman Democrat Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-NM) struggled in a statement to defend her party’s move forward with an effort to impeach President Trump. In fact, the statement does not even use the word “impeachment,” even though she is now personally implicated as a Democrat member of the House majority in the effort to impeach Trump.

“Congress has a legal right to see the full details of any whistleblower complaint, especially those that involve our nation’s security,” Torres Small said. “The President must release the full complaint and allow any testimony by the whistleblower, or any other administration officials, to occur free of White House interference. Through the coming weeks and months, I will act to support and defend our Constitution by insisting on a transparent process that fully informs the American people and restores trust and faith in our system. Any threat to our national security must be taken seriously.”

In response, her Republican challengers lit into her. Yvette Herrell, the GOP candidate from the 2018 race who nearly defeated Torres Small and was leading the Democrat on election night but votes added in later swung the race the other way, told Breitbart News that Torres Small is part of a Pelosi-led coup attempt against Trump.

“Nancy Pelosi and her radical socialist allies know they can’t beat President Trump at the ballot box, so now they are trying to impeach him over a phone call they didn’t hear and haven’t seen the transcript of,” Herrell said. “I will continue to stand in strong support of our President as I have always done, and I know that everyday hardworking New Mexicans will see through this stunt for the political charade it is.”

Claire Chase, an oil and gas executive who has come under fire for previous social media posts criticizing Trump from 2015 and 2016 who now claims to support Trump, also ripped Torres Small and defended Trump on Twitter.

Even Charlie Cook, the editor of the nonpartisan rating service the Cook Political Report, tweeted out on Wednesday how bad this looks for Democrats and how it will not move voters their way:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters. — Charlie Cook (@CharlieCookDC) September 25, 2019

If Republicans start banking races like these this early ahead of 2020, and putting these Democrats so far on the defensive that they need to surrender some seats in their majority, the GOP could theoretically–if it has enough quality candidates in place and structural resources built out across America–run the tables on the Democrats next year. There is a lot of time between now and then, but Democrats are clearly worried about what is happening–concerned it will backfire on them, as McCarthy is saying it will.

Democrat National Committee member from California Bob Mulholland told Politico about the impeachment push from his party’s leader from his own state: “Absent Trump being caught in a trunk with a young boy, impeachment is a political disaster for us Democrats.”"

To retake the majority in 2020, Republicans only need to win back a net gain of 19 seats next year–and now that the Democrats have abandoned the possibility of passing any legislation whatsoever on things like infrastructure, prescription drug pricing, healthcare, the economy, jobs, guns, in favor of impeachment, Republicans feel like the Democrats have given them a messaging gift going into 2020.

McCarthy, for an hour-long exclusive interview that aired on Breitbart News radio in early August, laid out the GOP plan to retake the House majority with these 31 districts at the forefront of the effort.

“There are 31 seats that Democrats sit in today that President Trump carried,” McCarthy said. “Of those 31, 13 of them President Trump carried by more than six points. So, here you have the socialist wing of the party trying to take them further left, when the only way they have the majority is actually winning in Republican areas—areas that would be swing districts.”

Republicans were confident then, going into the August recess. But these efforts, thanks to the Democrats’ decision in the words of one GOP aide to “jump the shark completely now” with moving on impeachment proceedings, have now been supercharged this week.

In another of those 13 super pro-Trump districts that the president won by more than 6 percent, New Mexico’s second district, incumbent freshman Democrat Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-NM) struggled in a statement to defend her party’s move forward with an effort to impeach President Trump. In fact, the statement does not even use the word “impeachment,” even though she is now personally implicated as a Democrat member of the House majority in the effort to impeach Trump.

“Congress has a legal right to see the full details of any whistleblower complaint, especially those that involve our nation’s security,” Torres Small said. “The President must release the full complaint and allow any testimony by the whistleblower, or any other administration officials, to occur free of White House interference. Through the coming weeks and months, I will act to support and defend our Constitution by insisting on a transparent process that fully informs the American people and restores trust and faith in our system. Any threat to our national security must be taken seriously.”

In response, her Republican challengers lit into her. Yvette Herrell, the GOP candidate from the 2018 race who nearly defeated Torres Small and was leading the Democrat on election night but votes added in later swung the race the other way, told Breitbart News that Torres Small is part of a Pelosi-led coup attempt against Trump.

“Nancy Pelosi and her radical socialist allies know they can’t beat President Trump at the ballot box, so now they are trying to impeach him over a phone call they didn’t hear and haven’t seen the transcript of,” Herrell said. “I will continue to stand in strong support of our President as I have always done, and I know that everyday hardworking New Mexicans will see through this stunt for the political charade it is.”

Claire Chase, an oil and gas executive who has come under fire for previous social media posts criticizing Trump from 2015 and 2016 who now claims to support Trump, also ripped Torres Small and defended Trump on Twitter.

Even Charlie Cook, the editor of the nonpartisan rating service the Cook Political Report, tweeted out on Wednesday how bad this looks for Democrats and how it will not move voters their way:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters. — Charlie Cook (@CharlieCookDC) September 25, 2019

If Republicans start banking races like these this early ahead of 2020, and putting these Democrats so far on the defensive that they need to surrender some seats in their majority, the GOP could theoretically–if it has enough quality candidates in place and structural resources built out across America–run the tables on the Democrats next year. There is a lot of time between now and then, but Democrats are clearly worried about what is happening–concerned it will backfire on them, as McCarthy is saying it will.

Democrat National Committee member from California Bob Mulholland told Politico about the impeachment push from his party’s leader from his own state: “Absent Trump being caught in a trunk with a young boy, impeachment is a political disaster for us Democrats.”"

“Let’s be clear, there was no quid pro quo for Ukraine to get U.S. aid in exchange for looking into Biden and his son,” read one of the talking points, referring to the president’s chat with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that included the corruption probe into Joe and Hunter Biden, according to screenshots of the talking points obtained by Politico.

“This complaint was handled absolutely by the book and it was properly determined that no further action should be taken,” read another, referring to the Justice Department’s decision not to begin a criminal investigation into the complaint.

But the messages also wound up in the hands of the Democrats, who ridiculed White House Republicans over their error in email courtesy.

“I would like to thank @WhiteHouse for sending me their talking points on how best to spin the disastrous Trump/Zelensky call in Trump’s favor,” Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) said in a tweet. “However, I will not be using their spin and will instead stick with the truth. But thanks though.”

Another Democrat, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), called the talking points “Orwellian lies and toxic trash”:

Levin described disdain for America’s founding among Democrats and the broader left.

“The people who believe the country began in 1619 with slavery, who accuse the Founders of being white supremacists and trash the Constitution as nothing more than a document to protect white slave owners keep waving around the Constitution as they advance their Marxist agenda,” began Levin.

LISTEN:

Levin continued, “Nancy Pelosi is undermining the Constitution as she claims to be promoting it and cites Benjamin Franklin at the end of the Constitutional Convention. The way this is supposed to work, impeachment is considered an extremely grave act. That’s the way the Framers debated it. It was the second-most debated subject at the Constitutional Convention after the nature of the presidency.”

Levin went on, “[The Framers] rejected things like maladministration as a basis for impeachment. They rejected the idea that pure politics should be the basis for impeachment, so they put specific language in the Constitution about high crimes and misdemeanors and a specific process: a majority vote by the House, a supermajority vote after a trial in the Senate overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.”

“This is not intended to be some kind of political act,” continued Levin. ” I hear these so-called experts on TV saying impeachment is whatever the House says it is, citing Gerald Ford. That’s not what the history of our Impeachment Clause is. [The Framers] looked very deeply at British common law, what the Parliament had done with respect to the monarch; they rejected all sorts of proposals, and this is a very high bar. It’s not just, ‘Well, we don’t like a president’ or ‘We think he did this, that, and the other thing.'”

Levin described how the Framers feared a usurpation of the president’s accountability to the public via impeachment from the House, establishing a secondary constitutional check on the process within the Senate.

“The Senate is in place under the impeachment process to keep a check on the House because they were concerned — if you look at Federalist 65 — there was some concern that the House would have too much power,” Levin stated. “The great fear was that a president wouldn’t be accountable to the public, but he’d be accountable to the House of Representatives, and that’s why they set up this elaborate process.”

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is using the impeachment process to protect her political position — and that of her House Democrat favorites — from left-wing challengers, estimated Levin.

“So what did Nancy Pelosi do yesterday?” asked Levin. “Nothing. She’s got six of her politburo chairman-types that she handpicks, who have the same ideology out of these deep blue metropolitan areas that are not representative of the diversity of this nation out of mostly New York and Los Angeles, who do what? Who are going to continue to conduct themselves as she announces a formal impeachment inquiry.”

Levin went on, “[Nancy Pelosi] doesn’t have a vote of the full House of Representatives, which is the traditional process that we have in this country. Why? Because if you’re going to go down this road, you need the body politic. You need the so-called representatives of the people engaged in this. She, like a dictator, issues a fiat to her six handpicked chairmen to conduct a formal impeachment inquiry.”

Levin said, “So, in other words, a tiny percentage of the House of Representatives — a tiny percentage of the population of the United States — is going to drag this entire nation through their left-wing hell because this is something they’ve been dreaming to do from the moment this president was elected, and she’s going to protect her so-called moderates, of which there are really only a handful, because she wants to cling to power, so there won’t be a roll call vote on the floor of the House of Representatives? The fact is nothing has changed, other than her putting a different label on what she’s doing, and, of course, the media love it.”

Pelosi fears internal Democrat challenges from the left, assessed Levin.

“I think that Nancy Pelosi — despite all the propaganda on her behalf as the first woman speaker — is weak,” Levin remarked. “She buckled. She’s befuddled. She’s got a radical Marxist wing in her party and a radical antisemitic wing in her party. She’s got [Jerry Nadler], who is being challenged in his Democrat primary by somebody, believe it or not, who is to the left of him, and they’re doing this throughout her leadership.”

“[Nancy Pelosi] already lost one of her big guys to AOC,” recalled Levin. “So they’re scared, and they want to cling to power, and this is the best she can figure out how to do it, but she’s dragging the nation through her hell. The media love this.”

Levin praised Breitbart News. “Let me say this. You guys do tremendous work. Tremendous work. I couldn’t be prouder of what you guys are doing. You came under attack, vicious attack. It’s just amazing. You guys are accused of being alt-right. You’re the biggest supporters of state of Israel anywhere that I can see. You’re being attacked for your [so-called] extremist views. You’re constitutionalists. You support what this country is doing. This is what they do. They try to destroy, smear, character-assassinate anybody who dares to stand up for liberty in this country, so keep it up.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) will not respond to his invitations for discussion, Levin shared.

“As far as AOC is concerned, she’s a reprobate,” Levin stated.”If she wants to run the country, then run for president. Other than that, she’s nothing more than a media creation. They celebrate her. I’ve invited her on every one of my platforms. Whether it’s TV, whether it’s digital TV, whether it’s radio, and we get crickets. She is a coward, and she is a dunce.”

Senate Republicans refuse to investigate possible corruption on the part of Joe Biden and other Democrats, noted Levin.

“They’re doing nothing,” said Levin of Republican senators. “How is it that the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is supposedly run by this guy Richard Burr — who’s in the Witness Protection Program — how is it that they can’t hold a hearing on Hunter and Joe Biden? Where are their subpoenas?”

Levin asked, “Our good friend Lindsey Graham, where is he? He runs the Senate Judiciary Committee. I hear all the talk. How about a little bit of action? What are they doing on the Foreign Affairs Committee? How is it that they’re not issuing subpoenas? How is it that they’re not demanding public testimony? You know, we do control the Senate, and it is appalling to me what’s taking place here.”

“The Biden family is corrupt,” determined Levin. “Joe came into office — 36 years in the Senate followed by eight years as vice president. He’s a multimillionaire. His son is a multimillionaire. His brother is a multimillionaire. They have an IQ of negative 19, combined. How the hell did this happen? We’d like to know.”

“It’s an attack on us,” concluded Levin of Democrats’ pursuing impeachment of Trump. “It’s an attack on our constitutional system, and I would argue that what these people are doing is absolutely un-American, period.”

The ongoing improvement in expectations for capital spending could indicate improving economic conditions. In its most recent statement, the Federal Reserve pointed to lower levels of business investment in recent months as a source of sluggishness in the U.S. economy.

The Survey’s Business Uncertainty index also declined in September to its lowest level since March. The uncertainty index climbed in the second and third quarter this year as global growth slowed and on-and-off again talks with China clouded the path of trade policies."

“Folks appear to be switching jobs more frequently, and they’re getting not only a wage boost, but a stronger wage boost than in the relative past,” said Nick Bunker, a labor economist at Indeed.com. “This is just another sign of how a stronger tighter labor market helps lower-income workers” to get higher wages, he told the Wall Street Journal.

The data was revealed by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who reported “the rate of transitioning to a new employer for respondents with household income of less than $60,000 reached 12 percent in July 2019—the highest level this series has recorded since its start in July 2014.”

Job-switching is markedly higher for Americans earning less than $60,000, the Fed report said.

The job-switching is helping to push up American salaries. For example, the report includes a chart showing that full-time salaries reached an average of $66,936 in July 2019, up from $57,000 in July 2014.

“Wages are rising, incomes are soaring,” Trump said a September 22 speech in Houston. “In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken over $1,000 extra in rising wages, and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we’ve done.”

The gains are made possible in the tight labor market created by Trump’s combination of lower migration and higher economic growth.

The report says:

The benefits of the tight labor market for workers can be observed from the following chart … [which] displays a significant upward trend in the average salary of full-time workers … this upward trend has been broad-based across age, education, and income groups …. Tight labor markets are generally characterized by increased competition among employers to attract workers.

But the report also notes a much lower rate of job switching among higher-income and older Americans:

For respondents with higher household incomes, this rate has been on a downward trend since March 2018. We observe a similar trend when we analyze the series based on age: since July 2017, employer-to-employer transitions have been rising, for the most part, among younger respondents (under age 45) and declining (toward the series low) for older respondents.

This caution by college-graduate Americans may be caused by pressure from peers and employers, — but may also be caused by the huge number of lower-wage visa-workers who are being used to cold down college salaries.

Nationwide, companies employer roughly 1.5 million foreign college-graduates in U.S. jobs. That huge number is almost twice the number of Americans who will graduate in 2091 with skilled degrees in engineering, mathematics, business, healthcare, science, software, or architecture. Many of the foreign workers will take low salaries — and will work long hours — in the hope of being paid with green cards from their employers.

The number of foreign graduates who compete for U.S. jobs likely will sharply increase if the Senate endorses a bill by Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee that allows employers to offer up to 120,000 visas to Indian employees per year.

The bill is being opposed by numerous groups, including the Multinational Coalition and American for Legal Immigration PAC.

Immigration Numbers

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately 1 million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than 1 million work permits for new foreigners, and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.

But President Donald Trump’s “Hire American” policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, to bring their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work."

Juul said in an announcement that Burns will be replaced by K.C. Crosthwaite, who was an executive at tobacco giant Altria, which holds a minority stake in Juul.

Crosthwaite said in a statement that there’s an “unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry. Against that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate. That includes inviting an open dialogue, listening to others and being responsive to their concerns.”

The San Francisco-based Juul said Wednesday that it is “suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the U.S.”

The company also said that it is “refraining from lobbying the Administration on its draft guidance and committing to fully support and comply with the final policy when effective.”

The Trump administration is preparing a ban on flavored e-cigarettes, which have become popular among young vapers. Juul’s statement on Wednesday suggests that it won’t try to fight the proposed ban.

Vaping has come under fire after a string of deaths linked to e-cigarettes. So far, at least nine deaths have been tied to vaping and e-cigarette use in the U.S.

The Centers for Disease Control recently reported that there have been 530 cases of lung injury in the U.S. from individuals with a history of e-cigarette product use or vaping.

Trump has publicly criticized the youth craze for vaping, saying on Twitter: “While I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes, we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL! Let’s get counterfeits off the market, and keep young children from Vaping!”

The Census Bureau said on Wednesday that new home sales rose 7.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000 units in August. July and June’s sales pace were also revised up.

The three-month moving average, which many economists consider a more reliable indicator of the health of the housing market because it smooths out month-to-month volatility, climbed to 703,000, the fastest pace in nearly 12 years.

Economists polled by Econoday had forecast an annual pace of 662,000 new home sales, a 3.5 percent climb.

Compared with a year ago, sales were up 18 percent.

New home sales appear to be benefitting from the strength of the labor market and lower interest rates. The Fed cut its interest rate target by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its July meeting and mortgage rates are down by more than a percentage point from last year’s high.

Although new home sales account for only 11.5 percent of total housing market sales, they have bigger spill-over effects on the economy. Home building increases demand for labor and new homes need to outfitted with furniture and appliances.

New home sales are counted when contracts are signed. In August, about 63 percent of the homes sold were either under construction or yet to be built. That means the economic benefits of Augusts sales will continue to be felt in the months to come.

Low levels of residential investment had been a drag on the economy, pulling down GDP for six consecutive quarters. That is likely to change now, with residential investment providing a boost to growth this quarter.

Sales were particularly strong in the largest markets for new homes, the South and the West. Sales in the South jumped 6.0 percent. Sales in the West climbed 16.5 percent. Sales were down in the Northeast and the Midwest."

It seems unlikely that this advice would be taken by the Democratic Party as each member of the House would seek to get their fifteen minutes in the sun to rail against Trump on a national stage. Still, no impeachment proceedings have even been launched.

Despite what many liberals think, however, Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi did not actually advance impeachment on Tuesday when she made her announcement that she supports an impeachment inquiry.

Until there is a move on the floor of the House of Representatives to launch official impeachment proceedings and enter articles of impeachment, no actual impeachment is underway. Pelosi’s proclamation was simply an agreement to keep debating the subject.

Despite what Michael Moore may imagine, Pelosi only advanced the appearance of progress on impeachment. Not an actual impeachment procedure.

5. House votes-1 hr.

DONE.

After that, “Move on to removing Trump 11/3/20,” Moore explained.

Keep the Impeachment SIMPLE:

1. ONE WEEK to compile charges based on Trump’s confessions, whistleblowers report & prosecutor’s evidence.

2. FOUR DAYS of hearings

3. Committee votes-1 hr.

4. Debate on House floor-4 days.

Move on to removing Trump 11/3/20 — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) September 25, 2019

It seems unlikely that this advice would be taken by the Democratic Party as each member of the House would seek to get their fifteen minutes in the sun to rail against Trump on a national stage. Still, no impeachment proceedings have even been launched.

Despite what many liberals think, however, Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi did not actually advance impeachment on Tuesday when she made her announcement that she supports an impeachment inquiry.

Until there is a move on the floor of the House of Representatives to launch official impeachment proceedings and enter articles of impeachment, no actual impeachment is underway. Pelosi’s proclamation was simply an agreement to keep debating the subject.

Despite what Michael Moore may imagine, Pelosi only advanced the appearance of progress on impeachment. Not an actual impeachment procedure.

The demand, which came from U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), resurfaced Wednesday in an opinion piece written by conservative Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post.

Ironically, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared Tuesday that the mere possibility that President Trump had asked Ukraine to continue an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden — even without a quid pro quo — was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry. (Biden boasted in 2018 that he had forced Ukraine to remove its prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid; he did not tell his audience at the Council on Foreign Relations that the prosecutor was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving.)

Thiessen observed (original links):

It got almost no attention, but in May [2018], CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as “strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,” the Democratic senators declared, “We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,” before demanding Lutsenko “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

The Democrats’ letter is available online here. In it, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy demanded that the Ukrainian government answer their questions about the Mueller probe, and issued an implied threat: “This reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal — to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community — about your government’s commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law.”

“It is a crime for the president to solicit aid for his campaign from a foreign government,” Napolitano said.

“That to which the president has admitted is, in and of itself, a crime,” Smith responded. “Yes,” the judge replied.

It sounded rather damning — except that Smith and Napolitano do not seem to have considered that there might be independent justification for re-opening an inquiry that Biden had ordered closed (with the threat of losing U.S. aid).

Moreover, Napolitano has said many times before that Trump has committed crimes — and he has been wrong:

1. December 2018: Napolitano claimed that Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, had implicated him in a “felony.” (The Southern District of New York investigated and declined to initiate any further prosecutions.)

2. January 2019: Napolitano told Shepard Smith that Mueller would be able to show “collusion” and “conspiracy” because “the campaign had a connection to Russian intelligence.” The Mueller report found no collusion.

3. February 2019: Napolitano claimed that a phone call by the president to Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was “obstruction of justice.” Mueller’s report, released a month later, did not allege any obstruction.

4. April 2019: Napolitano went on an extended rant claiming that Trump had obstructed justice many times — claiming, falsely, that Trump had ordered his aides “to break federal law.” Napolitano called President Trump’s conduct “immoral … criminal … defenseless … [and] condemnable.” In fact, Trump complied fully with Mueller.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the Democrat-led House’s impeachment inquiry puts the Democrat Party “in a new direction.”

Her remarks come after months of infighting between far-left members of the “Squad” and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who has tried to dial back the remarks and efforts from the ultra-progressive wing of her caucus.

According to Axios, Ocasio-Cortez welcomed the official inquiry, proclaiming that the effort puts the party “in a new direction.”

“This puts the party in a new direction… The party is unified. The power behind that, and the weight behind that adds an urgency and an expeditiousness to the investigations that I don’t believe we would’ve seen,” Ocasio-Cortez said:

The freshman lawmaker’s declaration follows months of tension over the general direction of the Democrat Party, which boiled over after Pelosi accepted a bipartisan emergency funding package over the “Squad’s” version over the summer. Emotions ran even higher after the speaker dismissed the far-left “Squad” members in a July 6 interview with the New York Times.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez openly aired out the Democrat Party’s dirty laundry on Twitter.

“A glass of water could’ve [beat a 20-yr incumbt]”

“The Green Dream or whatever”

“Their public whatever” Those aren’t quotes from me; they‘re from the Speaker. Having respect for ourselves doesn’t mean we lack respect for her. It means we won’t let everyday people be dismissed. https://t.co/VMRkcd8xlL — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 8, 2019

They eventually made amends, meeting at the end of July to clear the air. Pelosi told a reporter following the meeting that the two did not have “that many differences.”

However, the ongoing battle for the heart of the party has not stopped. The impeachment effort has been at the center of the “Squad’s” agenda. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) said on her first day in office that they were going to “impeach the motherfucker.”

Ocasio-Cortez called for impeachment prior to taking office, appearing on the Real America with Jorge Ramos show in November 2018, and calling impeachment a “no-brainer.”

“I mean, yeah. To me, it’s a no-brainer,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Well, I believe that he has violated the law.”

“Violated potentially many laws, whether it’s the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with,” she continued.

“Whether it’s what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence,” she added, mentioning the bar “Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton.”

“But overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me,” she added.

In September, Ocasio-Cortez dared Senate Republicans to go on the record and “knowingly vote against impeachment of this president knowing his corruption” so they can “have that stain on their careers the rest of their lives”:

She took another veiled shot at Democrats last week, tweeting, “At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it”:

Pelosi demonstrated consistent efforts to stall the calls from her far-left colleagues, urging them in a caucus-wide call last month to follow the facts and warning them that the public “isn’t there” yet on impeachment.

As Breitbart News’s Joel Pollak noted:

But Pelosi is no longer waiting for the facts. She will make her stand based on the supposed principle that Congress is entitled to information from a reported whistleblower complaint that the administration has withheld thus far. Yet Pelosi has other avenues, such as the courts, to pursue that information. She has been forced to change her view on impeachment because she no longer controls her caucus.

“AOC and the Squad have won; they hold real power,” he added."

That is unconstitutional and illegal, it’s also a violation of campaign finance laws. In addition, if the whistleblower complaint is correct — that Donald Trump had delayed military aid in order to extract leverage to get the Ukrainian leader to investigate Trump’s political opponent — that would be another article of impeachment that would look just like bribery. And third, depending on whether or not the White House provides the whistleblower’s complaint in full, it is illegal for them not to provide it in full. The law’s very clear that you must provide this complaint to Congress.

SAAGAR ENJETI: The underlying problem here was, of course, Hunter Biden receiving $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian energy company. Do you think that is evidence of corrupt behavior?

LIEU: No, people sit on boards, they get monetary payments and what evidence actually shows is the Ukrainians actually looked into this, terminated the investigation and found nothing there.

Trump authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of the conversation on Tuesday, and it was released subsequently on Wednesday.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump previewed. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”

The transcript shows Trump asking Zelensky to “find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike”– a reference to ongoing questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts.

The transcript reads:

President Donald Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a

lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess

you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the·whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, ·it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible. President Zelensky: Yes it is. very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to·open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United· States and Ukraine.· For that·purpose, I just recalled our.ambassador from the United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer.

Hunter Biden was brought up after the fact:

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Republican lawmakers across the board agree that there is no smoking gun and “zero” grounds for impeachment.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said he is “incensed by the Fake News media and Socialist Democrats’ distortion of truth” after reading the full transcript of Trump’s conversation and urged Americans to read it for themselves.

He outlined some “noteworthy observations”:

First, President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating “Crowdstrike” (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelenskyy, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond “Crowdstrike. Only thereafter did President Trump mention then-Vice President Joe Biden’s possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son (who was allegedly involved in corrupt practices and may very well have been prosecuted for corruption but for then-Vice President Biden’s monetary threats, coercion and intimidation of Ukraine’s political leadership). Second, in no way, shape or form did President Trump ask Ukraine President Zelenskyy for “campaign help.” There is no request for campaign contributions, campaign volunteers, yard signs or anything else of a campaign nature. Rather, President Trump’s request is very straightforward and an effort to root out and uncover corrupt practices that may (or may not) reach all the way to America’s White House under President Obama and V.P. Biden. Third, I would hope and encourage every President of the United States to root out and uncover corrupt practices in the United States, or by any American citizen anywhere, particularly when the allegations reach to the highest levels of America’s government— the White House! Finally, the Fake News Media and Socialist Democrats are engaged in a fake “Russian Collusion Scandal 2.0,” albeit this time involving Ukraine. The Fake News Media and Socialist Democrats should apologize to the American people for their intentional and knowing distortion of the truth. They won’t, of course, because they care more about advancing a hyper-partisan, Socialist, anti-America agenda than they do telling the American people the truth.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) concurred. “I’ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo. The Ukrainian President admitted problems with corruption in the country and agreed that the issue at hand warranted looking into further,” he said in a statement.

He continued in part:

The firing of a prosecutor looking into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son following pressure from Mr. Biden himself is worthy of investigation. That a president who ran on an anti-corruption platform would look into this matter is unsurprising and is in both the U.S. and Ukrainian national interest. For years, Democrats have decried foreign interference in U.S. elections. But this seems to be a one-way street. Democrats are wholly uninterested in looking into past Ukrainian efforts to help former Vice President Biden, as well as the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, which reportedly used Ukraine to undermine the Trump campaign. That’s not how the rule of law works. National media attention to only one side of this issue is disappointing even if unsurprising. The Obama administration used the Department of Justice and its intelligence agencies to investigate a political opponent in then-candidate Trump while using foreign government sources to further the investigation. But it’s supposedly unacceptable for the Trump administration to encourage a foreign nation to look into a matter that it was prevented from fully investigating by the previous administration with clear conflicts of interest. That’s not a standard that makes any sense.

“Just read transcript of POTUS’ call w/Ukraine Pres. Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote.

“This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!” he added.

“The special counsel wrongfully flipped the legal burden of proof to require President Trump to conclusively determine his innocence. Now Democrats have done the same thing to our national security,” Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) said in a statement.

He continued:

The transcript conclusively determines, despite Democratic promises to the contrary, that there was no quid pro quo. No mention of military aid. No violation of the law. But to conclusively prove his innocence, a classified and privileged conversation between a foreign head of state and our president is now in the public view. In their desire to undo the 2016 election and destroy President Trump, Democrats have today unequivocally and irreparably harmed our national security and compromised an important ally. Instead of forming an impeachment line, Democrats should consider forming an apology line.”

Trump authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of the conversation on Tuesday, and it was released subsequently on Wednesday.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump previewed. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”

The transcript shows Trump asking Zelensky to “find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike”– a reference to ongoing questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts.

The transcript reads:

President Donald Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a

lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess

you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the·whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, ·it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible. President Zelensky: Yes it is. very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to·open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United· States and Ukraine.· For that·purpose, I just recalled our.ambassador from the United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer.

Hunter Biden was brought up after the fact:

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Republican lawmakers across the board agree that there is no smoking gun and “zero” grounds for impeachment.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said he is “incensed by the Fake News media and Socialist Democrats’ distortion of truth” after reading the full transcript of Trump’s conversation and urged Americans to read it for themselves.

He outlined some “noteworthy observations”:

First, President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating “Crowdstrike” (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelenskyy, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond “Crowdstrike. Only thereafter did President Trump mention then-Vice President Joe Biden’s possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son (who was allegedly involved in corrupt practices and may very well have been prosecuted for corruption but for then-Vice President Biden’s monetary threats, coercion and intimidation of Ukraine’s political leadership).

In a statement, Pelosi accused President Trump of using “taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.”

“Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” the speaker added. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”

The transcript, released earlier Wednesday, shows President Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Democrats have latched on to the request, claiming the president appeared to have threatened to hold back military aide from Ukraine unless it investigated the Biden family.

“The release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security. The President has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad,” said Pelosi.

On Tuesday, President Trump said he asked White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold the aid from Ukraine roughly one week before he spoke with Ukraine’s leader.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said ahead of his address before the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

During a press conference on Tuesday, Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry in light of the Trump-Zelensky.

“I’m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of an impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable,” she stated.

President Trump on Tuesday blasted Pelosi’s decision to begin proceedings to oust him from the Oval Office, tweeting: “There has been no President in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have.”

“The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,” he added. “They get nothing done.”"

Moderate Democrats who came out in support of impeachment and put their careers on the line are now questioning what is new or different from before.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), one of the House’s most vulnerable Democrats, came out with six other moderate colleagues on Monday evening to back an impeachment inquiry in an op-ed that was seen as a watershed moment in impeachment efforts.

But after a Democrat caucus meeting with Pelosi Tuesday afternoon, Slotkin reportedly said to Democrat colleagues: “If you are asking us to stay on message, give us a g-ddamn message to stay on.”

“We came out [in favor of an impeachment inquiry] because this is something different, this meeting did not give me confidence that this will be something different,” she said.

Pelosi speaking. Meanwhile some Dems are not happy about what they heard and are speaking out in the caucus. “If you are asking us to stay on message, give us a goddamn message to stay on,” Rep. Slotkin said. — Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) September 24, 2019

Pelosi announced Wednesday the House was conducting an “official impeachment inquiry” and the various committee chairmen investigating the president should proceed with that understanding.

Other vulnerable Democrats also appear to be having second thoughts.

According to Politico on Tuesday:

Another first-term Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, raised a similar sentiment about Democrats losing focus on what led the party to this moment, after Pelosi and other key chairmen outlined a multi-step plan for their impeachment inquiry involving the six committees investigating Trump. Several moderates are also privately worried about members of their caucus going too far, with some progressives declaring prematurely that Democrats are ready to imminently impeach Trump.

Impeachment is not popular with the general electorate or independents, according to recent polls.

Their fears could be heightened after Trump released the transcript of the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was the main impetus for the calls for impeachment.

Reports about the call suggested that Trump had offered Ukraine military aid in exchange for investigating Joe Biden’s son.

However, the call transcript showed that there was no such quid pro quo. The two leaders discussed how the U.S. was helping Ukraine with military aid more than Germany and the European Union.

Trump asked if Zelensky could help him get to the bottom of the whole Russian collusion allegations, which he suggested may have started in Ukraine. Zelensky then brought up that one of his assistants recently spoke to Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who is investigating Joe Biden’s son’s dealings in Ukraine.

Trump’s remarks about Biden’s son were in its entirety: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Moderate Democrats who came out in support of impeachment and put their careers on the line are now questioning what is new or different from before.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), one of the House’s most vulnerable Democrats, came out with six other moderate colleagues on Monday evening to back an impeachment inquiry in an op-ed that was seen as a watershed moment in impeachment efforts.

But after a Democrat caucus meeting with Pelosi Tuesday afternoon, Slotkin reportedly said to Democrat colleagues: “If you are asking us to stay on message, give us a g-ddamn message to stay on.”

“We came out [in favor of an impeachment inquiry] because this is something different, this meeting did not give me confidence that this will be something different,” she said.

Pelosi speaking. Meanwhile some Dems are not happy about what they heard and are speaking out in the caucus. “If you are asking us to stay on message, give us a goddamn message to stay on,” Rep. Slotkin said. — Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) September 24, 2019

Pelosi announced Wednesday the House was conducting an “official impeachment inquiry” and the various committee chairmen investigating the president should proceed with that understanding.

Other vulnerable Democrats also appear to be having second thoughts.

According to Politico on Tuesday:

Another first-term Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, raised a similar sentiment about Democrats losing focus on what led the party to this moment, after Pelosi and other key chairmen outlined a multi-step plan for their impeachment inquiry involving the six committees investigating Trump. Several moderates are also privately worried about members of their caucus going too far, with some progressives declaring prematurely that Democrats are ready to imminently impeach Trump.

Impeachment is not popular with the general electorate or independents, according to recent polls.

Their fears could be heightened after Trump released the transcript of the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was the main impetus for the calls for impeachment.

Reports about the call suggested that Trump had offered Ukraine military aid in exchange for investigating Joe Biden’s son.

However, the call transcript showed that there was no such quid pro quo. The two leaders discussed how the U.S. was helping Ukraine with military aid more than Germany and the European Union.

Trump asked if Zelensky could help him get to the bottom of the whole Russian collusion allegations, which he suggested may have started in Ukraine. Zelensky then brought up that one of his assistants recently spoke to Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who is investigating Joe Biden’s son’s dealings in Ukraine.

Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) press conference on Capitol Hill.

Schiff said the newly released transcript of a phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a “classic mafia-like shakedown.”

Schiff said, “This is more damning than I and others had imagined. It is shocking on one level that the White House would release these notes and felt that somehow this would help the president’s case or cause because what those notes reflect is a classic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader. They reflect a Ukrainian president who was desperate for U.S. Support, for military support, to help that country in a hot war with Putin’s Russia, a country that is still occupied by irregular Russian forces, in which people face a very dangerous and continuing and destabilizing action by their aggressive neighbor.”

He continued, “At the same time, a president of the United States who immediately after the Ukraine president expresses the need for further weapons, tells the Ukraine president that he has a favor to ask. The president communicates to his Ukrainian counterpart that the United States has done an awful lot for Ukraine, we’ve done a lot for Ukraine, more than the Europeans have done for Ukraine, but there is not much reciprocity here. This is how a mafia boss talks. ‘I have a favor to ask you.’ And what is that favor? To investigate his political rival, to investigate the Bidens. It’s clear the Ukraine president understands exactly what is expected of him and is making every effort to mollify the president. What adds another layer of depravity to this conversation is the fact that the president of the United States then invokes the attorney general of the United States as well as his personal lawyer as emissaries, in the case of the attorney general, as an official head of a U.S. Department of Justice, to be part and parcel of this.”

He added, “I think in its most naked form, and this is what our inquiry is going to look into, the president has now admitted the notes of this call, and we don’t even know if this is the complete notes of that call, indicate the president of the United States shaking down a foreign leader, essentially undermining the national security of this country, for a personal political gain and one that violates his oath of office.”

“This is the smoking gun,” Julián Castro (D) declared. “Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to work with his Justice Department to investigate a political opponent.”

“Congress should cancel recess and begin impeachment proceedings immediately,” he added:

“This ‘transcript’ itself is a smoking gun,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) echoed. “If this is the version of events the president’s team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy.”

“We need to see the full whistleblower complaint and the administration needs to follow the law,” she continued. “Now”:

Trump authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of his conversation with Zelensky on Tuesday.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump said. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”:

The transcript does not provide a “smoking gun,” as Democrat candidates proclaim. Rather, it shows Trump asking the Ukranian leader to further look into the 2016 election meddling roots — something Democrats, given their self-described goals of ensuring election security, would be in favor of.

Trump said:

I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Biden’s son was not mentioned until after the fact:

… I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

As the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel explained:

The RNC issued a statement urging Biden to be transparent about his dealings after President Donald Trump announced he would release the transcripts of a conversation he had with Ukraine’s new head of state. The conversation had become controversial after Trump urged the Ukrainian government to probe into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country.

“Now that the President has authorized the release of the transcript of his call with President Zelensky, we call on Biden to release the transcripts of his calls as Vice President with Ukrainian and Chinese leaders while his son was conducting shady business deals in those countries,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said.

My full statement: pic.twitter.com/OTqGze3J1A — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) September 24, 2019

The move comes as Joe Biden is embroiled in controversy over his son’s business dealings with foreign governments. In Ukraine, alone, the younger Biden secured a lucrative appointment to the board of directors of the country’s only independent oil and natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014.

Hunter Biden received the position, which reportedly paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry. Around the same time, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Hunter Biden’s appointment and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption is at the center of the rush by House Democrats to impeach Trump. Many on the left claim Trump allegedly broke the law by suggesting to the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, that he probe into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma.

Joe Biden, himself, echoed that sentiment on Wednesday during a public press conference.

“If President Trump refuses to comply with congressional requests, then he will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said, before refusing to address questions from reporters. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor for Breitbart News, detailed in his book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden profited off extraordinary deals in countries like Ukraine and China that were unavailable to regular citizens.

“Joe Biden became point person to two countries, in particular, Ukraine and in China. And in both cases, his son cashed in,” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on Fox News."

McCarthy spoke to Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday.

“Why aren’t we investigating Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?” asked Rep. McCarthy, “because I’ll promise you this: Hunter Biden — if his name was Hunter Smith, no one would’ve hired him. He wouldn’t have found a billion dollars in China, and an oligarch in Ukraine wouldn’t be hiring him.”

“But why do you have a vice president who’s running for president, who’s number one in the Democratic polls, bragging that he held Ukraine hostage to fire a prosecutor that was gonna investigate his own son?” continued the house minority leader. “Why isn’t anybody up in arms about that? And why is that not being investigated?”

Watch below:

Rep. McCarthy joined The Sean Hannity Show on Tuesday to discuss House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent announcement of the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” — which he described as simply Pelosi’s attempt to “appease the socialist wing of the [Democrat] Party.”

The Ukraine scandal involving Joe and Hunter Biden does, indeed, appear to be a touchy subject for Democrats. On Saturday, Joe Biden snapped at Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, who asked the former vice president about his son’s involvement with Ukraine.

“Here is what I know,” said Biden, whilst pointing his finger repeatedly at Doocy. “I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader? Trying to intimidate a foreign leader? If that’s what happened … that appears what happened.”

“You should be looking at Trump!” exclaimed Biden. “Ask the right questions!”

On Tuesday, Democrats saw to it that the media were looking at President Donald Trump after Pelosi announced a “formal impeachment inquiry” against the president in the wake of his reported comments regarding Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Hunter Biden.

By Wednesday, however, the Democrats’ new strategy was of no avail, as the White House released the entire transcript of President Trump’s July phone call with Zelensky, revealing that neither Trump nor Zelensky discussed authorized military aid payments, which disproves the claims Democrats made.

Police and military personnel deployed to the area for a rescue effort. Several hours later, police located an abandoned vehicle on the outskirts of rural Huanímaro.

A total of 37 were killed statewide in 2019.

The eight law enforcement officers were killed from September 18 to September 24. Monday’s most recent attack focused on the operations commander from the municipality of Celaya, according to local reports.

The violence began against a federal officer in charge of the Regional National Intelligence Center (Centro Nacional de Inteligencia or CIN) when he was wounded and his bodyguard was killed on a rural highway. Cartel assassins reportedly stopped Officer Juan José Olvera Soriano’s car and shot Cuauhtémoc Izquierdo, the bodyguard. The assailants beat Olvera Soriano and left him behind.

On Thursday afternoon, a group of gunmen in three SUVs ambushed a convoy of correctional officers transporting prisoners. The attack left five dead and two wounded. The incident occurred on the road connecting Valle De Santiago with Salamanca, a short distance from the Cereso Mil prison.

The next attack occurred on Friday night when gunmen fired a volley of rifle rounds at the offices of the state attorney general’s office, according to local reports. A ministerial police agent identified as Luis Alberto died from gunshot wounds, plus three other officers were wounded with a civilian.

On Saturday at noon, Deputy Police Director Jorge Cisneros Rangel from the municipality of Pénjamo was murdered after being kidnapped during a university lecture. His body was recovered in rural Huanímaro.

The most recent killing occurred Monday when the operations commander identified as Comandante Sergio Morales Casas was ambushed while traveling on a city street, according to local reports. Comandante Casas was driving home at the end of his shift when multiple shooters fired from a nearby vehicle.

Senate Democrats, along with eleven Republicans, voted to pass S.J. Res. 54, which would terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration on the southern border. The resolution was created by Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and co-sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Susan Collins (R-ME).

Sen. Collins said on the Senate floor Wednesday before the vote that the bill is not about “whether you’re for or against a border wall.” The Maine senator, who is up for a tough reelection fight in 2020, claimed that she has “consistently supported” funding for physical barriers on the southern border.

However, Congress has failed to provide significant funding to help secure America’s southern border by building a border wall. With Congress’s failure to provide funding, President Trump declared a national emergency to build the border, which diverted military funding so that he could build a wall along the southern border.

The Republican senators who voted against Trump’s national emergency to build the wall include:

Lamar Alexander (R-TN) Roy Blunt (R-MO) Susan Collins (R-ME) Mike Lee (R-UT) Jerry Moran (R-KS) Rand Paul (R-KY) Rob Portman (R-OH) Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) Mitt Romney (R-UT) Pat Toomey (R-PA) Roger Wicker (R-MS)

All of these Republicans voted in March to terminate the national emergency, and the resolution failed to override a veto-proof majority in the House after Trump vetoed the legislation.

Sen. Marco Rubio voted against the national emergency in March; however, on Wednesday, he did not vote to terminate the national emergency.

Although most of the Republican senators have signaled that they approve of building a wall, it remains to be seen how they will find an avenue to fund that wall without a national emergency declaration, given that Congress has failed to find a legislative solution to finance it."

The vote arises as the Pentagon announced in September that they will delay or suspend 127 military construction projects so that $3.6 billion can be diverted to help secure America’s southern border.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that many Republicans might decide to vote with Democrats because local military bases’ funds have been diverted towards funding the wall.

“I don’t think anyone, no matter what state they are from, will want to see money being taken away from their military installations, [which is] very much needed,” Schumer said Tuesday.

Congressional Democrats failed to pass the resolution to override Trump’s national emergency in March, which failed to override the president’s veto.

Comscore, a company that claims to measure media audiences for entertainment companies and advertisers, has agreed to pay a $5 million fine to settle the charges.

The fraud and false claims charges are particularly notable because Comscore is in the business of providing information and analytics about media and entertainment companies.

The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in orders made public Tuesday that from February 2014 through February 2016, Comscore, at the direction of its former CEO Serge Matta, entered into deals to exchange sets of data without cash consideration but recognized revenue on the fair value of the data received. This had the effect of improperly inflating the company’s revenue, according to the SEC.

The SEC’s said that Comscore and Matta made false and misleading disclosures regarding the company’s customer base and flagship product and that Matta lied to Comscore’s internal accountants and external audit firm. As a result, Comscore artificially exceeded analyst estimates for revenues in seven consecutive quarters, creating an illusion of smooth and steady growth, the SEC alleged.

Melissa R. Hodgman, Associate Director in the SEC’s Enforcement Division:

As the SEC orders find, Comscore and its former CEO manipulated the accounting for non-monetary and other transactions in an effort to chase revenue targets and deceive investors about the performance of Comscore’s business. We will continue to hold issuers and executives accountable for such serious breaches of their fundamental duty to make accurate disclosures to the investing public while giving appropriate credit for a company’s prompt remedial acts and cooperation.

Comscore settled the charges without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, agreeing to cease-and-desist from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay penalties of $5 million. Matta, also without admitting or denying the charges, agreed to pay $700,000 and to reimburse Comscore $2.1 million representing profits from the sale of Comscore stock and incentive-based compensation. He also agreed to an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years."

Internal documents from TikTok, the short-form video app and spiritual successor to the app Vine, appear to show the firm instructing moderators to remove content which may anger the Chinese government according to the Guardian. The company’s content guideline documents break infringing content into two categories: “violations,” and “visible to self.” Violations would see the content removed by videos marked “visible by self” would only be viewable by the people that posted them to the platform, similar to a shadowban.

The Guardian states that the sections which addressed political issues that may anger the Chinese government were designed to look more all-purpose. Politically subversive content would fall under the “visible to self” category according to the Guardian. Business Insider reports that this includes:

Criticizing China’s socialist system was incorporated in a ban on “criticism/attack towards policies, social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, monarchy, parliamentary system, separation of powers, socialism system.”

The “demonization or distortion of local or other countries’ history.” Examples listed included the May 1998 riots of Indonesia, the Cambodian genocide, and Tiananmen Square.

“Highly controversial topics” were banned. These included: “separatism, religion sects conflicts, conflicts between ethnic groups, for instance exaggerating the Islamic sects conflicts, inciting the independence of Northern Ireland, Republic of Chechnya, Tibet and Taiwan and exaggerating the ethnic conflict between black and white.”

The app also forbid the specific mention of 20 current and former world leaders including Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, Mahatma Gandhi, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Kim Jong-un, Shinzo Abe, Park Geun-Hee, Joko Widodo and Narendra Modi. Surprisingly, China’s premier Xi Jinping was not on the list.

TikTok’s parent company ByteDance said in a statement that the outlines were outdated and have since been replaced. ByteDance stated:

In TikTok’s early days we took a blunt approach to minimizing conflict on the platform, and our moderation guidelines allowed penalties to be given for things like content that promoted conflict, such as between religious sects or ethnic groups, spanning a number of regions around the world. As TikTok began to take off globally last year, we recognized that this was not the correct approach, and began working to empower local teams that have a nuanced understanding of each market. As we’ve grown we’ve implemented this localized approach across everything from product, to team, to policy development. The old guidelines in question are outdated and no longer in use. Today we take localized approaches, including local moderators, local content and moderation policies, local refinement of global policies, and more. We also consult with a number of independent local committees and are working to scale this at a global level, including forming an independent committee of leading industry organizations and experts to continually assess these policies. We also understand the need to be more transparent in communicating the policies that we develop and enforce to maintain a safe and positive app environment. Users gravitate to TikTok because it provides an app experience that fosters their creativity, and we are committed to supporting that across our teams, product, policies, and the way in which we openly communicate with our community.

ByteDance purchased the American lip-syncing app Musical.ly in 2017 for $1 billion and combined it with its video app Douyin to create TikTok. The app quickly became the top free non-gaming iOS app in 2018.

Sony vows its upcoming Playstation 5 gaming platform will focus on lower power consumption to save the Earth.

Hollywood Reporter reports that Sony’s PlayStation has “joined forces” with the United Nations environment committee to develop a new partnership called the Playing for the Planet alliance. Sony Interactive Entertainments President and CEO Jim Ryan stated in a blog post: “We believe that careful stewardship of natural resources is of utmost importance and are aligned with the mission and objectives of UN Environment. Earlier this year, they created a new Youth and Environment Alliance and quickly realized partnering with the video game industry would help them reach their sustainable development goals.”

Rya attended the U.N. Climate Summit in New York City recently where the issue of global climate change was discussed by world leaders. Sony has made attempts to reduce the power consumption of its PlayStation 4 console in the past, Ryan said due to the firms efforts the company has avoided carbon emissions that amount to “almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29 million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017).”

Ryan stated that the firms new PlayStation 5 console set to be released next November will also be focused on lowering power consumption: “I am also very pleased to announce the next-generation PlayStation console will include the possibility to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4,” said Ryan. “If just one million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the average electricity use of 1,000 U.S. homes.”

Ryan stated that the firm will be conducting a carbon footprint assessment of its gaming services and will make the data from the study public: “Our commitments are not only related to hardware and operations, we are also keen to help inform people interested in sustainability goals,” said Ryan.

Ryan stated that the firm will also explore potential apps for its VR service which could raise awareness of climate change: “There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games industry to take a stand and support the U.N. Environment team by communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for generations to come,” said Ryan. “We look forward to seeing what the industry can achieve together.”

Sony vows its upcoming Playstation 5 gaming platform will focus on lower power consumption to save the Earth.

Hollywood Reporter reports that Sony’s PlayStation has “joined forces” with the United Nations environment committee to develop a new partnership called the Playing for the Planet alliance. Sony Interactive Entertainments President and CEO Jim Ryan stated in a blog post: “We believe that careful stewardship of natural resources is of utmost importance and are aligned with the mission and objectives of UN Environment. Earlier this year, they created a new Youth and Environment Alliance and quickly realized partnering with the video game industry would help them reach their sustainable development goals.”

Rya attended the U.N. Climate Summit in New York City recently where the issue of global climate change was discussed by world leaders. Sony has made attempts to reduce the power consumption of its PlayStation 4 console in the past, Ryan said due to the firms efforts the company has avoided carbon emissions that amount to “almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29 million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017).”

Ryan stated that the firms new PlayStation 5 console set to be released next November will also be focused on lowering power consumption: “I am also very pleased to announce the next-generation PlayStation console will include the possibility to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4,” said Ryan. “If just one million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the average electricity use of 1,000 U.S. homes.”

Ryan stated that the firm will be conducting a carbon footprint assessment of its gaming services and will make the data from the study public: “Our commitments are not only related to hardware and operations, we are also keen to help inform people interested in sustainability goals,” said Ryan.

Ryan stated that the firm will also explore potential apps for its VR service which could raise awareness of climate change: “There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games industry to take a stand and support the U.N. Environment team by communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for generations to come,” said Ryan. “We look forward to seeing what the industry can achieve together.”

Josh Hawley (R-MO) sent a letter on Tuesday to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), urging its five commissioners to release the agency’s 2012 report that detailed Google’s anticompetitive policies.

Sen. Hawley sent a letter to the agency’s five commissioners to release the full 2012 report detailing Google’s anticompetitive behavior. Half of the 2012 report released was disclosed in 2015 and detailed that the search engine giant manipulated its search results to bias its own services over Google’s competitors.

“I believe the remaining pages likely contain information critical to the public interest because they may reveal that Google has long been deceiving consumers,” Hawley wrote in his letter to the commissioners.

Sen. Hawley’s letter to the FTC arises as 50 attorneys general have announced an antitrust investigation into Google’s manipulation of the online search and digital advertising markets.

The Missouri senator noted that two years ago, the European Union (EU) fined Google $2.7 billion for manipulating its search results. Hawley contended that Google was “in fact rigging specific search results to favor the interests of Google’s executives.”

Sen. Hawley noted that the 2012 FTC report noted that, citing internet Google documents, that they manipulated their search engine “to bias ourselves.”

He added “Google was misleading consumers about how its algorithm worked” and that “Google systematically deceived consumers,” which provides “real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets.”

Sen. Hawley noted other anticompetitive behavior the search engine engaged in, including:

For example, the report states on pages 28 and 116 that, even as Google told the public it was delivering the most relevant results, it was in fact blacklisting results that it did not like. Google “enter[ed] into exclusive and highly restrictive agreements with web publishers that prevent publishers from displaying competing search results,” and Google “adopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.”

The report provides evidence that Google was deceiving consumers before 2012, and the recent fines levied against Google suggest that Google never stopped. The public has a strong interest in knowing the extent of Google’s pattern of deception so that they can make informed decisions about whether to continue using Google or instead switch to a different service that does not rely on deception.

“I ask you to release the remainder of the report because the public has an interest in knowing how one of the largest, most powerful companies in the world has engaged in deception,” Sen. Hawley concluded in his letter to the FTC.

“We know you are angry, frustrated, tired and sad about these events on campus. We are taking swift action,” said CSU president McConnell in an email addressed to “all students, faculty and staff” obtained by Breitbart News.

McConnell’s email was initially addressing a recent incident in which CSU students were reported to have worn “blackface” — commonly seen in resurfaced photos of left-wing politicians — as well as in regards to a swastika that was allegedly found drawn on a university apartment building.

But then, the university president oddly segued the content of her email from instances of racism, to an upcoming CSU event featuring TPUSA founder and executive director Charlie Kirk.

A TPUSA spokesperson confirmed to Breitbart News that among the students involved in the previously reported “blackface” incident, none of them are or ever have been affiliated with the school’s TPUSA chapter.

“Blackface is racist and dehumanizing. The swastika is an abhorrent and abiding symbol of anti-Semitism,” states McConnell in her email. “Acts of bias and racism are widespread across the country and the globe, but they should not be happening on the CSU campus.”

The university president then went on to say that the campus community must come together to “unanimously reject acts like these, and work on accountability,” before stating — in her next sentence — that she had just “learned” of the upcoming TPUSA event.

“We also learned Wednesday night that a student group exercising its First Amendment right to invite speakers to campus invited Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk to speak on campus on October 22,” said McConnell, bizarrely conflating Kirk and his conservative organization with racism and Nazism.

The university president then accused Kirk’s presence of having “sparked protests” at CSU and on college campuses across the country.

“We know that we must denounce hateful acts swiftly and powerfully and when we do things with negative consequences,” added McConnell, “many of you lose faith that CSU is acting on its Principles of Community.”

“We know you are angry, frustrated, tired and sad about these events on campus. We are taking swift action. We ask you to join with us, not to do all this work yourselves but to help us do the work that will make this a university where hate has no place,” continued the university president.

Charlie Kirk reacted to McConnell’s email in a statement to Breitbart News.

The recent email sent to the entire CSU student body by President Joyce McConnell is as shockingly ignorant as it is dangerously irresponsible. By conflating me and TPUSA with abhorrent racial acts that stand in direct opposition to our organization’s mission, she has placed hundreds of TPUSA chapter members directly in harm’s way. These are students that are part of a student-led chapter in good standing and fully recognized by the university. They are now at risk of being doxed, harassed and even physically assaulted because of President McConnell’s shameful email. This is not hyperbole. We’ve seen similar events at other universities, most recently at UT Austin. All CSU students and parents, along with our entire organization, deserve a prompt correction and a written apology for smearing these amazing young people, students who had zero connection with any recent racist acts at CSU.

Kirk went on to suggest that the university president conduct research before engaging in such rhetoric.

“President McConnell would also do well to review the footage of two recent speeches I’ve given in her own state — one at CSU and another at UC Boulder — where I explicitly condemn white ethno-nationalism as hateful, vile and un-American,” said Kirk.

“Equating good people with hate just because they are conservative, must stop,” he added. “We plan on pursuing every available recourse for this flagrant abuse and defamation by CSU’s president to help ensure that it does.”

You can hear Kirk condemning ethno-nationalism at an event on CSU’s campus last year, here.

At a University of Colorado, Boulder event last year, Kirk stated that “it doesn’t matter where you come from, it doesn’t matter your religion, it doesn’t matter your skin color — we are great because despite the melanin in your skin, or where you come from, you come here, you believe in a core set of ideas, you are an American. Period.”

Moments later, when a CU Boulder student confronted Kirk at the event by claiming that “all of the best” Olympic competitors are of “European stock,” Kirk responded by accusing the student of verging on “white nationalism.”

“I want nothing to do with ethno-nationalism, or anything like that,” affirmed Kirk. “I condemn. I disavow, and that is not true — hold on a second — you don’t understand what you just said, how ridiculous that is — you couldn’t be more wrong.”

Kirk will be speaking at Colorado State University on October 22, alongside featured guest speaker Donald Trump Jr.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) engaged in the most dishonest and shameless act of cultural appropriation imaginable, and the so-called Woke Movement is giving her a total pass.

These Woke Puritans on the left claim to be all about racial sensitivity, about opposing white privilege, about not offending people of color. They’re so rabid they swarm to attack nobody high schoolers who wear “problematic” prom dresses, white college kids who wear dreadlocks, even children who trick-or-treat as an Indian chief or an Eskimo or a Mexican bandit or an Arab.

This is supposed to be the New Sensitivity, right?

We’re supposed to be “perfecting” our society into something more pure and decent, right?

Well, then, explain to me just how in the hell a kid in a sombrero is “problematic” and not a 70-year-old white woman who spent decades wearing the equivalent of “redface” to advance herself?

For decades, Elizabeth Warren committed the most audacious act of cultural appropriation I have ever seen in a national politician. For decades, Warren pretended to be a Cherokee Indian, and to this day, even though her DNA test proves she’s has no more native blood (and probably less) than the average white American, she still hasn’t admitted she is not part Cherokee.

To everyday Americans, it’s her cheating that galls us; it’s someone pretending to be someone she’s not as a means to gain an advantage that galls us.

The Puritan Wokesters, though, if they actually were who they say they are, if they actually stood for what they say they stand for, should be apoplectic over Cherokee Warren, because what she did is not only outrageous, is not only a privileged white woman stealing a cultural identity purely for mercenary purposes, but you also have to ask yourself how many real-life people of color were not hired or promoted or given an opportunity because Cherokee Warren had already filled that slot?

What more proof is there that the Woke Movement is a total fraud filled with partisan liars. Here Warren is surging in the Democrat primary to a point where the Democrat presidential nomination is probably hers to lose. The latest polls show her up in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary states, and so far she has paid zero price from the Woke Police for decades and decades and decades of cultural appropriation.

Look at it this way…

If your child dresses as a Cherokee Indian this Halloween, the Woke-tards will be coming after you and him.

But Elizabeth Warren can spend decades pretending to be a Cherokee Indian as a means to get rich and famous and powerful, and these same people refuse to utter a peep.

According to a column published by Flynn on Quillette this week, Emerald Press has decided against publishing Flynn’s upcoming book, In Defense of Free Speech: The University as Censor, which makes the case that institutions of higher learning freely censor political expression.

In June, Emerald Press sent Flynn a letter to notify him that they would not be publishing the book. In the letter, the publishing house said that they would not publish content that addresses the “sensitive topics of race, religion, and gender.”

I am contacting you in regard to your manuscript In Defense of Free Speech: The University as Censor. Emerald believes that its publication, in particular in the United Kingdom, would raise serious concerns. By the nature of its subject matter, the work addresses sensitive topics of race, religion, and gender. The challenging manner in which you handle these topics as author, particularly at the beginning of the work, whilst no doubt editorially powerful, increase the sensitivity and the risk of reaction and legal challenge. As a result, we have taken external legal advice on the contents of the manuscript and summarize our concerns below.

The letter goes on to make the case that the book could incite “racial hatred” and “religious hatred” in the United Kingdom. Emerald Press admits that Flynn has “no intention” of inciting hatred but that intent doesn’t matter anymore. The letter goes on to suggest that the book could potentially violate the United Kingdom’s speech laws.

There are two main causes of concern for Emerald. Firstly, the work could be seen to incite racial hatred and stir up religious hatred under United Kingdom law. Clearly you have no intention of promoting racism but intent can be irrelevant. For example, one test is merely whether it is “likely” that racial hatred could be stirred up as a result of the work. This is a particular difficulty given modern means of digital media expression. The potential for circulation of the more controversial passages of the manuscript online, without the wider intellectual context of the work as a whole and to a very broad audience—in a manner beyond our control—represents a material legal risk for Emerald.

Flynn’s article includes his own synopsis of the book, which ends with a quote from George Orwell:

Discussing why free speech should extend to questions of race and gender necessarily involves presenting views (such as those of Jensen, Murray, and Lynn), if only for purposes of rebuttal, which upset those who believe that racial and sexual equality is self-evident. If upsetting students or staff or the public is a reason for banning speech, all such discussion is at an end. I end the book by quoting from George Orwell’s original preface to Animal Farm, which was itself rejected by Faber and Faber for being too critical of Stalin: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”

Flynn claims that he is reaching out to other publishers that might be interested in publishing the book. For now, due to leftist sensitivities and draconian speech laws, Flynn’s book on free speech is without a publisher and an audience."

According to a local news report, Dakota Carl Blakely has been arrested after allegedly threatening to commit an act of mass violence at the University of Texas.

Blakely was arrested after allegedly assaulting a security officer at the Dell Seton Medical Center. After biting the thumb of a security guard, Blakely was handcuffed. Blakely attempted to avoid arrest by running away from the security guard.

Blakely was sent to the Travis County Jail over the assault. During a medical examination at the jail, Blakely told a nurse that he planned to “shoot all the rich kids” at the University of Texas.

A report from Newsweek makes a different claim about Blakely’s threat. According to that report, Blakely threatened to shoot all the “rich white kids.”

Both reports claim that Blakely repeated his statement about the shooting several times. At one point, Blakely threatened to shoot a police officer in the room.

The University of Texas at Austin experienced one of the first campus shootings in 1966. On August 1, 1966, a shooter climbed a tower on the university’s main campus and began shooting. The shooter killed 17 people and injured 31."

Now, students and politicians are calling for an investigation.

According to a report by the Washington Post, it took two months for staffers at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand to find a student that had died in his dorm room.

The first-year student, who lived in a single-occupancy dorm room, was found after the student’s father contacted the police. Some students had complained about a strong odor that emanated out from under the student’s door.

Chris Hipkins, New Zealand’s education minister, has called for a thorough investigation into the officials that were responsible for residents in the building. “If you’re going into a hall of residence or a hostel, you are paying top dollar for not just a roof over your head but also the pastoral care that goes with that,” Hipkins said. “And I think clearly that’s not been present in this case.”

Bex Bryan, a former residential advisor at the University of Canterbury, expressed concern about the lack of professionalism from the current staff. Bryan claims that she had daily contact with all of the students for which she was responsible.

“We had DAILY contact with all our students we were responsible for. We planned weekend activities and we knew who was away and when,” Bryan wrote in a Facebook post. “This poor young man, my heart bleeds for his family. The Halls of Residence have certainly taken a dive since my days – evidenced by the litter and general behaviour of students there at night. I would urge the U of C to take a good deep investigation into procedures and policies, support structures and RA training. Shocking, unacceptable, and very very tragic.”

Breitbart News reported in February 2014 that a student at the University of Chicago was found in his dorm room a week after his death.

UNC released a letter to the Education Department on Friday, stating that the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies (CMES) contains relevant education material in compliance with Title VI, according to a report by the Chicago Tribune.

The university had been responded to an August 29 letter from the Education Department, which informed both UNC and Duke University that the schools would risk losing federal funds if they did not revise their joint Middle Eastern studies program by September 22.

The department argued that the program focused heavily on the “positive aspects of Islam” while severely lacking education regarding the positive aspects of Christianity and Judaism, as well as offering very few, if any, programs focused on the historic discrimination against religious minorities in the Middle East.

The department added that the program’s offerings are “plainly unqualified for taxpayer support,” as investigators looking into the matter had concluded that foreign language and national security “have taken a back seat to other priorities.”

According to the report, UNC’s vice chancellor for research Terry Magnuson says that the university started offering Arabic classes in 1959, adding that UNC now has the country’s highest enrollment in the Urdu language, as well as the eighth-highest enrollment in both the Arabic and Turkish languages.

Magnuson also claims that the program does provide sufficient education on national security, stating that UNC hosts several programs each year on such topics, some including featured speakers from the Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George Bush administrations.

In its letter, the Education Department had also noted a program focused on “Iranian art and film,” stating that CMES had not clearly demonstrated how such a program is secondary to more rigorous and relevant coursework.

In his rebuke, Magnuson also insisted that “Iranian art and film” does, in fact, improve language acquisition, as well as attract new students to the program.

With regards to the program lacking balance by not offering programs focused on the historic discrimination against religious minorities in the Middle East, Magnuson contested the claim, stating that CMES has held events regarding the persecution of Armenian Christians and other religious minorities.

Magnuson also said that the program “suffuses” with regards to the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism and other religions. The report added that Magnuson will be establishing an advisory board to address the matter at hand, and will keep records detailing the ways in which UNC’s expenses are applicable to the goal of the federal grant.

Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019

The president released the transcript shortly after his message on Twitter, which revealed that Trump spoke to Zelensky about the investigation of meddling in the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s possible corrupt behavior in the country.

Below is the relevant portion of the transcript

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me. President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I’m knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament; the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.

The president asked Zelensky to coordinate with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to discuss the investigations.

“Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy,” he said. “If you could speak to him that would be great.”

The president also pointed to a Breitbart News report that Democrats also reached out to Ukraine to ask officials to cooperate with an investigation."

According to a memo released by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel on Wednesday, the inspector general stated that it received a complaint of “urgent concern,” though the OLC determined the matter “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” or require that the national intelligence director send the complaint to House and Senate intelligence committees.

The OLC memo reads that the so-called “whistleblower” exhibited signs of “political bias,” yet the inspector general still found the still-anonymous individual to be credible.

“Although the ICIG’s preliminary review found ‘some indica of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,’ the ICIG concluded that the complaint’s allegations nonetheless appeared credible,” reads the opinion.

Fox News correspondent Ed Henry was first to report on the allegations of “political bias” in favor of a Trump rival on Tuesday evening.

Further, the inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the director of national intelligence in August that he believed the conversation between President Trump and Ukraine’s leader could have been a federal campaign finance violation because the president could have been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a Justice Department official said.

The whistleblower — a member of the intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard the information from “White House officials,” but did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.

Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and there was no consideration of the department’s policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, the official said.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the attorney general was first notified of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president “several weeks after the call took place,” when the department received the referral about potential criminal conduct.

“The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine — on this or any other matter,” the spokeswoman said.

Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower’s complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified setting.

The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American political events, leading House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to yield to mounting pressure from fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry.

Congress’ probe focuses partly on whether President Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government to undermine Biden and help his own re-election. Pelosi said such actions would mark a “betrayal of his oath of office” and declared, “No one is above the law.”

Meanwhile, the White House released a transcript Wednesday of a phone call between President Trump and Zelensky that’s at the center of the impeachment investigation.

House Democrats are examining the call to determine whether President Trump threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine in exchange for Zelensky’s government investigating the family of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Tens of millions in military aid was ultimately released to Ukraine this month, but investigators want to know what prompted Trump to threaten to withhold payment.

According to the five-page transcript, there were several references to Biden, but neither President Trump nor Zelensky discussed authorized military aid payments. They did discuss Biden’s son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukraine gas company between 2014 and early this year.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” President Trump told Zelensky. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … it sounds horrible to me.”

Following the transcript’s release, the president mocked Democrats in a tweet, writing: “Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise!”

The whistleblower — a member of the intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard the information from “White House officials,” but did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.

Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and there was no consideration of the department’s policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, the official said.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the attorney general was first notified of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president “several weeks after the call took place,” when the department received the referral about potential criminal conduct.

“The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine — on this or any other matter,” the spokeswoman said.

Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower’s complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified setting.

The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American political events, leading House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to yield to mounting pressure from fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry.

Congress’ probe focuses partly on whether President Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government to undermine Biden and help his own re-election. Pelosi said such actions would mark a “betrayal of his oath of office” and declared, “No one is above the law.”

Meanwhile, the White House released a transcript Wednesday of a phone call between President Trump and Zelensky that’s at the center of the impeachment investigation.

House Democrats are examining the call to determine whether President Trump threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine in exchange for Zelensky’s government investigating the family of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Tens of millions in military aid was ultimately released to Ukraine this month, but investigators want to know what prompted Trump to threaten to withhold payment.

According to the five-page transcript, there were several references to Biden, but neither President Trump nor Zelensky discussed authorized military aid payments. They did discuss Biden’s son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukraine gas company between 2014 and early this year.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” President Trump told Zelensky. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … it sounds horrible to me.”

Following the transcript’s release, the president mocked Democrats in a tweet, writing: “Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise!”

Conway, a staunch critic of President Trump, wrote on Twitter that Senate Republicans would withhold their position on impeachment for as long as possible and then ultimately vote to oust the president.

“I agree with this. There may be Republican senators who won’t say a word until the moment they say “guilty” when the roll is called at the end of an impeachment trial,” tweeted Conway in response to author Tony Schwartz, who opined that Republican senators will vote to impeach because they “privately hate” the president.

Conway’s bold prediction comes after he urged House Democrats over the weekend to pursue impeachment in the wake of reports that President Trump suggested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky ask his government to re-open a corruption inquiry into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

“Trump has already done more than enough to warrant impeachment and removal,” Conway wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post. “The current whistleblowing allegations, however, are even worse.”

The conversation between President Trump and Zelensky is part of a complaint by a so-called “whistleblower and is central to a formal impeachment probe announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Tuesday. On Wednesday, President Trump made good on his vow to release the transcript of the July 25th phone call, which shows (as the president confirmed this week, that he suggested Ukraine’s leader to looking into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the eastern European country.

Following the transcript’s release, President Trump called the formal impeachment inquiry the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.” He also stated of the call was, in fact, “a nothing call.”

“Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise!” he later tweeted."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fears the Democrat-led House impeachment effort could lead President Trump to ultimately claim vindication, he told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

Todd said Super Bowl Sunday, which is the first Sunday of February, is “essentially their unofficial deadline” because Democrats will not want to be in the impeachment process during primary season.

“Look, I do think Super Bowl Sunday is essentially their unofficial deadline here,” Todd argued.

He explained, “If they want to vote on articles, they’ve probably got to do that this calendar year. This is going to have to accelerate what [Pelosi] did not do yesterday is lay out what [does] this process look like and how do they keep it so it isn’t dragging on.”

The universal background checks, “assault weapons” ban, and other gun controls that were front and center and presented as critical for public safety are now back-burner items.

Gutowski tweeted:

The information Gutowski shared squares perfectly with one of President Trump’s tweets on Tuesday, wherein he suggested the Democrats were trading their legislative agenda for an opportunity to get Republicans (and Trump himself).

Breitbart News reported Trump’s suggestion that Democrats have dropped the pursuit of gun control, infrastructure funding, and prescription drug relief to try to hurt Republicans.

Democrat presidential hopeful Robert “Beto” O’Rourke’s promise to take away AR-15s from law-abiding citizens also hurt gun control advocacy. During the Democrat debate on September 12, 2019, O’Rourke said, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.”

Trump responded by referring to O’Rourke as “Dummy Beto.”

Sandy Phillips’ daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of 12 people killed in the suburban Denver theater during a midnight showing of the Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” also distributed by Warner Bros.

Phillips said she and four other people who lost loved ones in Aurora sent a letter to Warner on Tuesday, asking the studio to lobby Congress for gun control, support survivor programs and end any contributions to politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.

“When we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called ‘Joker’ that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,” the letter reads. “We want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility.”

Warner issued a statement later Tuesday saying it has always supported victims of gun violence and calling on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address what it called an epidemic.

Phillips says she was compelled to act after seeing a trailer for “Joker,” the name of the Batman villain portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film being released Oct. 4.

“My jaw dropped. I went, ‘Oh my god.’ And that was just the trailer. I was immediately triggered,” she said.

“Our purpose is to make the movie studios, the directors, the actors aware that when they make movie like this, they affect us directly,” Phillips said. “For someone who idolizes mass shooters, idolizes guns, that’s the kind of movie they absolutely love.”

Phillips’ support group, “Survivors Empowered,” and activist Igor Volsky of Guns Down America sent the letter to Warner CEO Ann Sarnoff.

“Companies like Warner have real leverage where Congress has failed,” said Volsky, citing recent actions by Walmart to stop selling handgun and short-barrel rifle ammunition after a string of mass shootings. “That’s why we are not calling for a boycott of this film. They have an opportunity to lead on this issue.”

“Joker” has been the subject of much debate since it premiered late last month at the Venice International Film Festival, where it won the top prize. It’s also expected to be a major awards contender.

The film is a character study of how Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian and clown-for-hire, becomes the classic Batman nemesis.

Director and co-writer Todd Phillips told the AP last month that the villain portrayed by Phoenix is presented in an “empathetic way.”

“You’re kind of on his side until you can’t be any longer,” Todd Phillips said.

Todd Phillips also questioned why some are conflating “Joker” with the movie theater shooting in Aurora in 2012.

“Aurora is obviously a horrible, horrible situation,” Todd Phillips said. “But even that is not something you blame on the movie.”

Prosecutors and a psychiatrist who evaluated Aurora shooter James Holmes have discounted some initial press reports that Holmes had told authorities he was the Joker.

Phoenix told the AP that he thinks it’s a good thing for movies to challenge an audience and that it’s not incumbent on the film or filmmaker to hold back because of how an audience might misinterpret the message.

“I don’t think it’s the filmmaker’s responsibility to teach morality,” Phoenix said. “And if you don’t know the difference between right and wrong, then there’s all sorts of things that you are going to interpret in the way that you want.”

“Make no mistake: Neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind,” the Warner statement said. “It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.”

Tom Sullivan, whose son, Alex, was killed while celebrating his 27th birthday inside the Aurora theater, said he wasn’t aware of efforts to send the letter until late Monday and didn’t sign it but that he supported Sandy Phillips’ endeavor. He also said he saw the film’s debut differently.

“I’m not afraid of the movie. I don’t think someone is going to watch it and go into their closet and pull out their firearms and do something tragic. That sort of process takes a long time,” said Sullivan, who has counseled shooting victims across the country and was elected a Democratic state lawmaker last year.

″‘Joker’ is art,” said Sullivan, “and art is supposed to create conversations.”

The Aurora theater was remodeled and renamed after the 2012 shooting that also wounded 58 people. Holmes was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Reached by telephone, an employee at Century Aurora and XD said Tuesday there were no immediate plans to show “Joker” at the theater but referred calls for comment to Cinemark spokesman James Meredith.

Meredith didn’t immediately return those calls."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced Tuesday that she is beefing up her presidential campaign as she surges in several primary polls across the country.

In a memo to supporters, campaign manager Roger Lau wrote the campaign will grow its presence in Flordia, Texas, California, Illinois, Maine, and Georgia, as well as hire additional staff to help support Democrats running in competitive state legislature races in Michigan and Minnesota.

“Remember: this election is about more than just beating Donald Trump — he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system,” Lau wrote. “If we want to make big, structural change, we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country,” explained Lau.

Further, the campaign said it hopes to increase resources for volunteers with a canvassing app to enable them to converse with voters.

“This is how we dream big, fight hard, and win. We’ve got a plan to make sure Elizabeth is the next president of the United States. And when she’s in the Oval Office — when our plans go from big ideas to reality with the help of this grassroots movement — I want you to know that you helped make it happen,” Lau continued.

The announcement comes as the Warren campaign readies an eight-figure ad buy in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.

“At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election — by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,” Lau said of the television blitz.

Meanwhile, Warren has solidified her status as the frontrunner in the Democrat presidential primary contest this week, two newly-released polls show.

Politico reports:

Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a new poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support.

Though some polls show Warren pulling ahead of Biden in some early primary and caucus states, a Real Clear Politics polling average shows the Massachusetts Democrat still trails the former vice president by roughly ten percent."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

Business Insider reports that Facebook has announced that it won’t be removing tweets from politicians that violate the rules of the site for fear of stifling political discourse. Facebook’s most senior spokesman, Nick Clegg, said at The Atlantic Festival in Washington D.C. on Tuesday that Facebook is taking steps to prepare for upcoming political elections and discussed how the site is changing its attitude towards political speech on its platform.

Clegg stated in his speech that Facebook will be cracking down on fake accounts will be making efforts to reduce the spread of fake news but that politicians’ speeches and political debates will not be fact-checked and will be allowed on the site even if they break Facebook’s rules. “Freedom of expression is an absolute founding principle for Facebook,” Clegg said.

Clegg continued to state: “Since day one, giving people a voice to express themselves has been at the heart of everything we do. We are champions of free speech and defend it in the face of attempts to restrict it. Censoring or stifling political discourse would be at odds with what we are about.”

Many appeared to disagree with Facebook’s decision, Alex Newhouse, an extremism researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies stated in a tweet: “To give politicians essentially free reign to lie, gaslight, and spread hate on the largest social platform on the planet isn’t just misguided, it’s actively dangerous, violent, and anti-society.”

But others believe that Facebook should not be making decisions about what political speech is or is not acceptable. Associate professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, Daniel Kreiss, stated: “[This] is primarily a political, not a media, problem in my view, and Facebook simply does not have the legitimacy to solve that.”

Clegg did state that the site would become involved in situations “where speech endangers people,” and that political ads would continue to be regulated.

Smollett was written out of the show after the Chicago Police Department not only found no evidence that there was any hate crime perpetrated against the actor but also found proof that Smollett engineered a fake attack himself just to get publicity.

Despite that massive embarrassment for the show, Empire went full Trump derangement with its first episode with a scene depicting series star Taraji P. Henson’s “Cookie” appearing on a TV show patterned after ABC’s The View, in which expressed her hope that the president would end up in jail.

As the character appeared on the faux talk show, Cookie went off on Trump as soon as his name was mentioned, saying, “please tell me they finally threw his lying ass in prison.”

The talk show’s ersatz Meghan McCain, “Lizzie” (Carisa Barreca), struck back with a snide comment noting that Cookie had been in jail herself, but for the most part, Empire portrayed Cookie as the crowd favorite for her attack on Trump.

Meanwhile, former Empire star Jussie Smollett is still not off the hook for what the Chicago Police Department determined was a hoax hate crime report. Indeed, the county prosecutor who surprised the city by declining to prosecute Smollett for the incident is now under investigation for her failure to charge Smollett.

The Raiders of the Lost Ark star spoke Monday at an event at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York where he gave an impassioned speech that focused primarily on the fires that have been consuming large sections of the Amazon.

He said the Amazon is “crucial to any climate change solution,” for its “capacity to sequester carbon, for its biodiversity, for its fresh water, for the air we breath, for our morality.”

Ford said the protection and preservation of the rainforest “can achieve at least 30% of the emissions reductions we need to protect the planet.”

Later in the speech, the actor praised young climate activists, saying that their generation has been failed when it comes to the environment.

“They are a moral army and the most important thing we can do for them is too get the hell out of their way,” Ford said.

The U.N. Climate Action Summit, which concluded Monday, featured appearances by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, who along with 15 other children filed a complaint with the U.N., accusing five countries of inaction on combatting so-called climate change.

Ford said in his speech that “greed is winning the battle for the Amazon.”

“What we’ve done to preserve the Amazon… is being purposefully undone. We need to protect what we have. We need to restore what we’ve lost.”

The actor called for the defunding of tax incentives and other mechanisms that “fuel deforestation.”

Ford said, “without the Amazon… we cannot achieve a climate solution and nothing else we do will matter.”

During the speech, the 77-year-old actor fumbled with his note cards and appeared to lose his way more than once, saying “in the movies, we get to do it over.”

The Star Wars actor is a well-known flying enthusiast who enjoys piloting private aircraft. Social media reaction to his speech noted how the actor’s emotional pleas clashed with his love of gas-guzzling planes.

The announcement, first reported by Reuters, says the Right Livelihood Foundation selected Thunberg for the award “for inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.”

“I’m deeply grateful for being one of the recipients of this great honor,” Thunberg told the Guardian UK. “But of course, it is not me who is the winner. I am part of a global movement of school children, youth and adults of all ages who have decided to act in defence of our living planet. I share this award with them.”

Recipients of this year’s award include women’s rights attorney Guo Jianmei, human rights activist Aminatou Haidar, and indigenous leader Davi Kopenawa. The award comes with a cash prize of around $100,000.

“With the 2019 Right Livelihood Award, we honour four practical visionaries whose leadership has empowered millions of people to defend their inalienable rights and to strive for a liveable future for all on planet Earth,” Right Livelihood Foundation said in a statement.

The development comes after Thunberg chastized world leaders this week at the United Nations General Assembly for what she described as their inaction against purported climate change.

“This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!,” Thunberg said in her accusatory speech.

“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!” she added.

Thunberg and 15 other children filed a complaint with the United Nations on Monday, accusing five countries of inaction on combatting so-called global warming.

The complaint, filed with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, accuses Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey of failing to fulfill their obligations to act against climate change, placing them in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a three-decade-old human rights treaty which sets out the civil rights of children.

“Change needs to happen now if we are to avoid the worst consequences. The climate crisis is not just the weather. It means also, lack of food and lack of water, places that are unlivable and refugees because of it. It is scary,” Thunberg said in a statement upon announcing the complaint.

The complaint does not name China, which accounts for 30 percent of global emissions, as it has not signed the part of the Convention on the Rights of the Child treaty allowing children to seek justice for breaching the agreement.

The complaint drew awe from French President Emmanuel Macron, one of the world’s most ardent supporters of the Paris climate agreement, who accused Thunberg of holding a “very radical” towards France and warned it would likely “antagonize societies.”

Brune Poirson, France’s Ecological Transition Minister, agreed with Macron, telling French radio station France Inter: “I am not sure that you mobilize people with despair, with what is almost hatred, setting people against each other.”"

“When the hearts of God’s people are faithful and crying out to Him, He listens, He’ll hear,” begins this year’s video for the event.

No better way to start the day than worshiping with our Raiders! God even sent a 🌈 to remind us of His presence and his promise! #SYATP pic.twitter.com/YOWcDH1BNt — Ashley Broom (@ashley_broom) September 25, 2019

The student-led movement, dubbed on social media #SYATP, launched in 1990 by a group of Texas students, reported Fox News.

The annual event, which CBN reports is now part of the Global Week of Student Prayer, draws about one million students throughout America and in more than 64 nations around the world.

Australian Christian singers Joel and Luke Smallbone of For King & Country promoted See You at the Pole in a video:

“This has always been something that has been close to me and my heart because I’ve been able to see the power of prayer and to be able to see when school students get together and surround that flag and be able to pray together, something real significant takes place,” Luke Smallbone said.

“It’s not about making a statement,” this year’s promotion video says. “It’s about prayer.”

Homeschooled students have planned other forms of gatherings to celebrate the event.

The student-led movement, dubbed on social media #SYATP, launched in 1990 by a group of Texas students, reported Fox News.

The annual event, which CBN reports is now part of the Global Week of Student Prayer, draws about one million students throughout America and in more than 64 nations around the world.

City Council Paralyzed by Homeless Crisis,"A member of the Los Angeles City Council is set to introduce a resolution Wednesday calling on California Governor Gavin Newsom to declare a “state of emergency” regarding the state’s growing homeless population.

In an op-ed in the Los Angeles Daily News on Tuesday, city council member Joe Buscaino wrote that state and local bureaucracies were preventing the city from helping homeless people and cleaning up the streets:

During the past several years, my staff and I have been working tirelessly to secure funding and approval for projects that will move people experiencing homelessness from sidewalk encampments into housing, including nearly 300 temporary emergency shelter beds, 500 permanent supportive housing units, and a homeless storage facility. We have also worked to develop immediate and near-term solutions that address the real world, street-level consequences of sidewalk encampments, and help protect public health and safety; including mobile restrooms, mobile showers, storage, off-street safe parking, and even hiring homeless individuals to pick up litter.

Each of these solutions has been implemented at an excruciatingly slow pace, with roadblocks and red tape imposed by numerous government bureaucracies — including several in our own city — at every step of the way.

Buscaino argued that a “state of emergency” declaration under state law would give Gov. Newsom to “the authority to suspend any statute, rule or regulation, if he believes strict compliance would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency.”

Meanwhile, the city council failed to move forward Tuesday evening on a new proposal to limit the areas in which homeless people can sleep on the sidewalks. The Daily News reported that advocates for the homeless protested the idea of clearing out homeless encampments before alternative shelter was available. Concerned residents complained about finding hundreds of hypodermic needles near homeless encampments, and that many residents of the camps did not want to use rehabilitation services.

The Los Angeles Times added: “Progressive activists have called to end the criminalization of homeless people and roll back rules that bar sleeping on sidewalks. Some community groups, in turn, want the city to ramp up enforcement of such rules to eliminate filth and blight.”

One of the thorniest problems is whether the federal courts would even allow the city to clear homeless people off the streets, after last year’s ruling in Martin v. Boise, when the Ninth Circuit held that punishing homeless people for sleeping on the street when there was no shelter available elsewhere violated their Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.

The city is facing an urgent public health crisis, as the homeless population has soared to nearly 60,000 people, many of whom have no access to bathroom facilities. Last week, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson visited the city and warned of a potential “epidemic.”

President Donald Trump has suggested that the federal government could intervene, using its own emergency powers — a proposal that Gov. Newsom and local leaders reject, though they have no solutions of their own.

Kohn was caught on a San Diego beach as he fled arresting officers. The accused and his company, Future Income Payments, were indicted in Greenville, South Carolina, in March. Federal charges included conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and wire fraud.

A civil suit has also been filed by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, asking for an order that Kohn and his various corporate entities pay more than a half billion dollars.

“It’s one of the largest, if not the largest, fraud case brought in the district of South Carolina,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Watkins told The Greenville News and Anderson Independent Mail. Kohn allegedly targeted veterans and unwary investors in what his former employees described as a “one billion dollar Ponzi scheme.”

Authorities said Kohn spent his ill-gotten gains on multi-million dollar houses in Los Angeles and Los Vegas, as well as luxury cars and expensive artwork.

Kohn offered cash advances to ex-military personnel in exchange for money from their benefits or pensions, but neglected to mention that selling those benefits is against the law. He also allegedly neglected to inform his victims that they would be charged up to 240 percent interest on the sketchy loans.

He then allegedly sold their debt to investors, promising as much as an 8 percent return and pocketing the remainder. And while Kohn’s defense has maintained that his “purchase agreements” with this vulnerable population should be considered exempt from state and federal laws, five judges — both state and federal — have disagreed.

More than 15 states have now issued cease-and-desist orders against Future Income Payments. Documents obtained by the FBI say that hundreds of sales agents received generous commission checks for setting up the deals, while the thousands of investors lost about $451 million.

Prior to Kohn’s ignoble seaside apprehension, Watkins claims there was an arrangement made for Kohn to turn himself in. After the deal fell through Kohn is believed to have used cash to stay at hotels and eat at IHOP. His Los Vegas estate and a house on Newport Beach have been sold."

Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s order was quickly approved by the state Public Health Council and applies to all vaping products and devices. The ban, though temporary, is broader than moves in at least two states, Michigan and New York, to ban only vape flavors.

His announcement came amid growing concern about the health effects of vaping products, including deaths.

The administration said that as of Tuesday, 61 cases of potential cases of lung disease related to the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping in Massachusetts had been reported to the state.

Three confirmed cases and two probable Massachusetts cases of vaping-associated pulmonary disease have been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The use of e-cigarettes and marijuana vaping products is exploding, and we are seeing reports of serious lung illnesses, particularly in our young people,” Baker said at a news conference at the Massachusetts Statehouse.

State health officials this month health began requiring the collection of data on potential cases of lung disease related to the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping in Massachusetts.

During the temporary ban, Baker said, the administration will work with medical experts and state and federal officials to better understand vaping illnesses and work on additional steps to address the public health crisis.

That, he said, could include legislation and regulations. The administration will also work on providing more resources for a public awareness campaign and smoking cessation programs, he said.

The CDC is investigating the outbreak but has not yet identified a common e-cigarette or ingredient. Nine deaths have been reported.

Dr. Anne Schuchat, of the CDC, told a congressional subcommittee Tuesday that she believes “hundreds more” lung illnesses have been reported to health authorities since Thursday, when the CDC put the tally at 530 confirmed and probable cases.

Michael Seilback, assistant vice president for state public policy at the American Lung Association, acknowledged the move by Massachusetts and said the federal Food and Drug Administration now needs to step up.

“From our perspective, it’s the absence of strong federal action by the FDA that is forcing states to have to make choices like this on how they are going to protect children and adults from the public health emergency of e-cigarettes,” he said.

Convenience store owners who rely on the foot traffic brought in by the sale of vaping products are going to be concerned by the decision, according to Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.

“There are clearly some issues there. The question is, what’s the problem? Is it the product being sold on the shelves by companies like Juul, or is it the off-brand stuff coming from other countries and sold on the internet?” Hurst said. “I hope we can all work together and find out what is the problem and find a solution soon.”

Democratic Massachusetts House Speaker Robert DeLeo said Tuesday that his legislative chamber is committed to addressing vaping and tobacco use among children.

The House is reviewing a bill that would ban the sale or distribution of any flavored tobacco or vape product to any consumer. The bill would carve out an exception for smoking bars.

“We look forward to collaborating with our partners in the senate and with the Baker administration to develop long-term, legislative solutions to these issues,” DeLeo said in a news release.

A lawmaker in Rhode Island also plans to introduce a bill to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in that state after the new legislative session begins in January."

Claims ‘Global Climate Leadership’ as Private Jet Use Soars by 50%,"The European Union (E.U.) is set to make a multi-million euro increase on funding private jet “taxis” for its officials, while also claiming to be a “global climate leader” demanding carbon emission cuts by 50 percent, if not 55 percent, by 2030.

Although the organization is still two years away from the current “air taxi” contract ending, it has decided to raise the amount that can be spent by officials to €10.71 million, a 50 percent increase on the starting amount, Politco reports.

The spending splurge comes despite new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledging to raise the E.U.’s 2030 emissions reduction target and set a 2050 climate neutrality goal.

In order to reach the 2050 target, von der Leyen urged cutting carbon emissions across Europe by 50 percent, if not 55 percent, by 2030.

“I want Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent in the world by 2050,” von der Leyen told the E.U. parliament in July, eliciting strong applause.

Von der Leyen told MEPs that, as part of a “Green Deal for Europe” in her first 100 days in office, she would push to enshrine the 2050 target in law with heavy penalties for member states that fail to hit their E.U. targets as directed by Brussels.

Whether or not private jet use by the E.U. is affected – if at all – remains to be seen.

The bloc’s original contract for private air travel said it was for the “provision of air-taxi transport services (chartered jet aeroplanes) for use by the President or other members of the European Commission, for the European Parliament Presidency, for the President of the European Council, for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and any accompanying persons, mostly in the European Union,” according to Politco.

This was for approximately 871 flight hours to destinations including Berlin, Stuttgart and Strasbourg.

But this was changed when a new notice said “analysis of expenditure during the period already elapsed has led to the conclusion that this threshold will not suffice to cover the needs of the European institutions until the expiry date of the contract i.e. 30.4.2021” .

However a commission spokesperson told Politico: “This does not mean that the total amount under the contract will be spent.

“The amended contract just provides a guarantee that the threshold will be sufficient to cover the needs of the E.U. institutions for the remaining period of the contract.”

Despite the E.U. drive for compliance with its harsh climate directives, there appears to be little resonance with citizens of member states.

The European Commission’s Eurobarometer survey, a twice-annually inquiry into the opinions of over 27,000 Europeans, asked people in 33 countries last month what their main concerns were for the European Union, and found worries over immigration to be the clear winner.

Breitbart News reported some 34 percent of Europeans surveyed said immigration was their top concern in 2019, putting the issue comfortably ahead of climate concerns that came in at just 22 percent of respondents’ worries."

While attempting to deliver the decision of the 2016 Brexit referendum, in which the British people gave the largest democratic mandate in the nation’s history in favour of leaving the European Union, the new Boris Johnson government has discovered it is unable to do so as Britain’s parliament is overwhelmingly in favour of the EU. Repeated defeats in the house and outside it, and laws passed compelling the Prime Minister to rule out no-deal Brexit have raised the spectre of a shadow government ruling the United Kingdom without actually taking official office.

In an effort to redress this imbalance which sees a coalition of opposition parties able to defeat the government in every vote, the Prime Minister has already attempted to call a general election twice, both of which have been rejected by the opposition. According to government sources speaking to British newspaper the Daily Telegraph in the wake of the government’s defeat at the Supreme Court, Mr Johnson will put an election forward to a Parliamentary vote for a third time, probably Thursday this week.

Until recently, a government facing this level of difficulty in actually governing would have already collapsed and gone to the polls, but thanks to an ill-advised law meddling with the British constitution introduced by David Cameron and Nick Clegg, this is no longer the case. In fact, now a hamstrung government needs the permission of the opposition to call a general election, a constitutional anomaly in British history.

In normal times the opposition party would always accept the opportunity to challenge the government and win a general election, presumably believing their policies and beliefs would be more attractive to the British people than those of the party already in power.

Indeed, calls for the Prime Minister to resign by opposition parties have intensified since the Supreme Court ruling, yet the most democratic constitutional apparatus for making this happen — going to the country for a fresh election — has been repeatedly rejected by opposition parties, and it appears unlikely this will change on the third time of asking.

When asked, spokesmen for opposition parties insist they will not permit an election to take place until, in their words, “no deal has been taken off the table”, meaning they refuse to allow an election while it remains a possibility that the United Kingdom could make a full break from the European Union, as was decided in the 2016 referendum.

Why opposition parties acting so nakedly anti-democratically in attempting to stitch up an election by making one possible outcome — an outcome which repeated polling shows is popular with the British people — impossible is hardly challenged by the government or the mainstream media who largely seem to accept the behaviour as perfectly reasonable.

Because the anti-Brexit opposition is now able to dictate to the government, it makes little sense for them to allow an election they may believe they would lose, like turkeys voting for a political Christmas.

It is thought if Labour is able to prevent the Prime Minister from actually delivering Brexit as repeatedly promised on October 31st, they would then agree to a general election as it would likely see Mr Johnson at his weakest — having failed to keep his word and take the UK out on that already much-delayed date, Nigel Farage’s Brexit party would likely be surging in the polls.

My Corbyn may have calculated that with the Brexit Party eating into Tory majorities in pro-Brexit seats across England and Wales the right-wing vote would split, leaving him free to win the election at that stage. Mitigating this risk is Nigel Farage himself, who has made the Prime Minister a peace offering in the form of an electoral pact where Brexit and Tory candidates would not stand against one another inn selected seats.

The suggestion was subsequently rejected with apparent disgust by sources within the government who called Nigel Farage not a “fit and proper” person to be allowed near the levers of government. The Prime Minister himself subsequently confirmed the position, saying “of course” he would not stand down Tory candidates in certain seats."

While attempting to deliver the decision of the 2016 Brexit referendum, in which the British people gave the largest democratic mandate in the nation’s history in favour of leaving the European Union, the new Boris Johnson government has discovered it is unable to do so as Britain’s parliament is overwhelmingly in favour of the EU. Repeated defeats in the house and outside it, and laws passed compelling the Prime Minister to rule out no-deal Brexit have raised the spectre of a shadow government ruling the United Kingdom without actually taking official office.

In an effort to redress this imbalance which sees a coalition of opposition parties able to defeat the government in every vote, the Prime Minister has already attempted to call a general election twice, both of which have been rejected by the opposition. According to government sources speaking to British newspaper the Daily Telegraph in the wake of the government’s defeat at the Supreme Court, Mr Johnson will put an election forward to a Parliamentary vote for a third time, probably Thursday this week.

The leader of the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), who faces a national election on Sunday, told German media that he had a “feeling” that the number of migrants crossing into Europe from Africa and the Middle East could once again be on the rise, Kronen Zeitung reports.

“Not only do I have the feeling that something is brewing. But I also have the feeling that we in Europe are partly to blame,” Kurz said.

Kurz slammed the new Italian leftist coalition government saying they had enacted a “reversal in migration policy” by opening the country’s ports to migrant transport NGOs.

This criticism was echoed last week by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó who argued that Europe was safer when populist leader Matteo Salvini occupied the post of interior minister due to his anti-mass migration policies.

According to Kurz, the open borders attitudes of the new Italian government send “very incorrect signals in the direction of Africa and in the direction of the people smugglers”.

In recent weeks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has also put pressure of the European Union to aid the building of housing along the Syrian border to accommodate Syrian refugees, threatening to unleash a wave of migrants into Greece if Europe does not contribute.

“If we go on his playing field, then we will pay more and more to him and he will increasingly have the impression that he has us in the palm of his hand,” Kurz said and added: “If people are rescued in the Mediterranean, we should do everything possible to put them back in their countries of origin.”

While Kurz and the ÖVP are expected to come first in Sunday’s snap election, many have speculated who their coalition partner or partners will be.

The populist Freedom Party, whose former leader resigned as a result of the Ibiza scandal that led to the fall of Kurz’s government, is also highly critical of allowing migrant transport NGOs to resume docking in Italy.

Former interior minister Herbert Kickl also slammed plans for an EU-wide migrant redistribution system saying: “The only signal in the right direction would be to rigorously ban NGO ships from docking in European ports and force them to bring people back to their base in North Africa.”

Since July, polls have showed that at least half of American voters have opposed beginning impeachment or an impeachment inquiry. However, Democrats have decided that a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son for corruption related to his work in Ukraine was a tipping point.

Recent polls show that the testimony of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller in late July did not even persuade voters to change their opinions on impeachment. Democrats are betting that this latest issue will — but a look at previous polls is not promising for them.

Gooden’s legislation would formally recognize the illegality of Nadler’s impeachment proceedings and remove the New York Democrat as the committee chairman.

The Texas congressman contended that the Judiciary Committee must receive authorization to begin impeachment proceedings; however, the House denied Nadler authorization by overwhelmingly rejecting H.R. 498 in July. Nadler has continued to claim that he is “impeaching the president– right now.”

“In recent days Democrats have sanctimoniously declared their allegiance to the rule of law. I encourage them to follow those rules and hold Chairman Nadler accountable for breaking them,” Rep. Gooden said in a statement Tuesday.

Rep. Gooden’s resolution arises as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced Tuesday that she will hold a press conference later in the day on whether Democrats will move forward on a potential impeachment inquiry into the president.

The latest impeachment effort arose after a report found that President Trump reportedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in the eastern European country.

Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani has said that Biden, as vice president, worked to shield from investigation a Ukrainian gas company with ties to Hunter.

“By law, he may not launch impeachment proceedings until the full House votes for him to do so. This attempted coup against a duly-elected, sitting president is unprecedented and must be stopped,” Gooden added in his statement. “I urge the Majority to move immediately to have him stripped of his chairmanship and that any accomplices on the Judiciary Committee not be considered as a replacement.”"

Trump’s tweet comes as reports indicate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is expected to announce an impeachment inquiry.

Democrats have been pressing the Republican-controlled Senate to take up gun control legislation which the House passed months ago. Just weeks ago, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) even went so far as to ask Trump to lay down “political cover” so Republican Senators could support gun control measures.

Trump is now turning it back on the Democrats, suggesting nothing is being accomplished because they have abandoned their legislative priorities. In this case, those priorities included all the gun control legislation Democrats claimed to be pushing for the sake of public and school safety.

The massively funded Arabella Advisors strategy company, which uses a web of fronts to push the interests of wealthy leftist donors, has been quietly behind key activism seeking to allow the use of federal funds to pay for abortions.

Arabella Advisors is a centralized hub that runs nonprofit arms that in turn have spawned a nexus of hundreds of front organizations outwardly designed to appear grassroots but actually working against ordinary people by expanding government control in the lives of Americans.

Arabella’s vast network was unmasked in an extensive exposé by conservative watchdog Capital Research Center, which documents the shadowy system developed by, housed in and staffed by the for-profit, privately held Arabella Advisors.

The Arabella firm in turn manages four nonprofits: the New Venture Fund, Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, and Hopewell Fund. These nonprofit entities play host to hundreds of groups and projects that promote interests and political movements strategically deployed in a long-term campaign to nudge the country to the left.

Arabella’s New Venture Fund maintains a project calling itself All Above All, which advocates for Congress to overturn the Hyde Amendment, the 1976 legislative provision that bans the use of federal funds for abortions with the exception only of extreme cases.

In 2017, All Above All and the lobbying arm of Arabella’s Sixteen Thirty Fund got behind the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (“EACH Woman”) bill, which sought to “ensure abortion coverage and care through the federal government” in Medicaid and Medicare. The bill also would have stopped state legislatures from restricting abortion coverage as part of private health plans.

The New Venture Fund also sponsors the Women’s Equality Center, which helps create strategic messaging to market pro-abortion campaigns.

The Capital Research Center report further documented, “The Center, in turn, nominally manages Keep Birth Control Copay Free (both are in reality part of New Venture Fund), which lobbies the government to force private health insurers to provide copay-free birth control coverage.”

The inspector general’s report has, thus far, been withheld by the administration.

Democrats allege that the Trump administration is violating the law in keeping the report from Congress, which was the chief reason cited Tuesday by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for changing her mind and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

It is not clear why the administration had withheld the report, though the White House announced Tuesday that it will release the report Wednesday, along with the transcript of Trump’s conversation with the new president of Ukraine.

Henry, citing a “senior official” with first-hand knowledge of the inspector general’s report, said that the anonymous “whistleblower” — who did not hear Trump’s conversation directly — was biased in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 opponents, though the official did not say which one.

Henry also said the official had told him that there would be no “smoking gun” in the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — even though there would be “at least a few words” in it that would cause unspecified problems for the White House.

Hannity added that his sources had also told him that Trump and Zelensky had only briefly discussed the aborted investigation into a company on whose board Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, had served. Biden boasted last year that he had forced the Ukrainian prosecutor out by threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid.

The expected announcement comes as more than two-thirds of House Democrats now say they support impeachment in light of President Trump confirming that he suggested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky probe Hunter Biden during a congratulatory telephone call in July. Pelosi will reportedly announce the new inquiry after the Democratic caucus’ meeting at 4:00 p.m. EST.

Earlier Tuesday, President Trump said he ordered White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold tens of millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine a week before he telephoned Kiev’s leader.

Before making his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Tuesday, the president told reporters he gave the order because he felt other allied nations weren’t providing enough.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

While still at the United Nations, President Trump later announced that he would release the full transcript of his phone call with Zelensky.

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” the president tweeted.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!” he added.

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

Though numerous congressional Democrats are now demanding an impeachment inquiry to be opened due to the Trump-Zelensky call, it remains unclear if the president broke the law by asking for an inquiry to be made into the Biden family. Further, the alleged “whistleblower” who reportedly claims to possess knowledge of the president pressuring Zelensky, did not hear the pair’s conversation first hand.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham hit out at reports regarding Pelosi’s expected announcement, saying in a statement “the Democrats continue to weaponize politics when they should be working on behalf of their constituents, which is nothing new.”

“President Trump is working hard on behalf of our country here in NYC while they continue to scream the word impeachment. Nothing new here,” added Grisham.

UPDATE — 4:55 p.m. EST: According to Politico, Pelosi told Democrats during Tuesday’s caucus meeting: “It would be my intention with the consent of this caucus … to proceed with an impeachment inquiry. He is asking a foreign government to help him in his campaign, that is a betrayal of his oath of office.”

UPDATE — 5:07 p.m. EST: At a Capitol Hill press conference House Speaker Pelosi officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump: “The House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry. The President must be held accountable; no one is above the law,” she said.

The migrants allegedly intended to enter the U.S. without proper documentation to make an asylum claim.

The detention of the three migrants from the Eastern European country recently took place at the international port of entry that connects the border city of Piedras Negras with Eagle Pass, Texas. As part of the ongoing immigration enforcement buildup in Mexico, authorities set up immigration checkpoints on the Mexican side of the bridge to check northbound travelers. The agents with Mexico’s National Immigration Institut encountered three migrants from Georgia at one of these checkpoints. Until 1991, Georgia had been part of the Soviet Union.

The migrants had been riding in a Honda SUV with license plates from the State of Mexico when they encountered the INM agents. The immigration agents checked their travel documents, law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas. The migrants provided them with their Georgian passports and the needed permits to travel freely through Mexico, but they were not able to provide authorities with the needed documents to make an asylum claim in the U.S. from Mexico.

Authorities took the migrants to the INM offices at the International Bridge #1 in Piedras Negras. The agents advised the Georgian migrants of the process and released them since they had not broken any law in Mexico. If the migrants had crossed into the U.S. and been sent back, they could have faced deportation proceedings in Mexico.

The move appears to only focus on states led by a rival political party and is supported by talking points previously made by cartel-connected groups.

This week, the senate majority of the Morena (National Renovation Movement) Party moved forward in its effort to present motions to remove the governors of Tamaulipas (Francisco Cabeza de Vaca) and Guanajuato (Diego Sinhue Rodriguez Vallejo) from the National Action Party (PAN). Senators from the PAN condemned the actions as political vendettas.

#Morena insiste en gobernar mediante el revanchismo político y violando la Constitución. No existe sustento jurídico para desaparecer los poderes en Guanajuato y Tamaulipas. ¡Seamos dignos representantes para los que nos votaron en las urnas, pongámonos a trabajar por México! pic.twitter.com/GHrkiiF7pR — Juan C. Romero Hicks (@JCRomeroHicks) September 24, 2019

Morena is focusing on leaders from a party that will likely serve as the core challenge to the left-leaning faction in future elections. Morena-dominated states like Veracruz are spared from senate scrutiny– where cartel gunmen recently torched a bar filled with customers.

In their claims against the Tamaulipas government, Morena senators point to what they call an “extrajudicial execution” by state police where they allegedly murdered eight innocent men and staged it to look like a cartel gun battle. The claims are echoed from the cartel-connected leader of the Nuevo Laredo Human Rights Commission, who was documented as an advocate for the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas. The Tamaulipas officers linked to that case are suspended and detained pending an investigation.

The Mexican senators do not mention the recent lack of action by the Federal Police and military in relation to the cartels like the Gulf and Los Zetas. In 2019, Tamaulipas state police were largely the only ones clashing with cartels in key border cities such as Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa–leading the Tamaulipas governor to publicly shame AMLO for federal inaction.

The Morena senators did not acknowledge data from Mexico’s National Public Safety System, which has shown a decrease in “high impact” crime like murders and kidnappings in the border state. Similarly, other federal statistics point to Tamaulipas seeing an economic boom. Guanajuato is suffering from a shortage of federal funding and cooperation as the region deals with an escalation in cartel violence. At least 37 police officers were killed there in 2019 alone.

McAllen Station Border Patrol agents received information about a possible human smuggling stash house on September 15. The agents coordinated with deputies from the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office to investigate the tip, according to information obtained from Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents and deputies arrived at the residence in Mission, Texas, and discovered “seven illegal aliens residing inside,” officials reported. The agents conducted immigration interviews. The interview revealed the migrants came to the U.S. from Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. The agents took the migrants into custody and transported them to the station for processing on immigration violations.

Two days later, the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office contacted McAllen Station agents. The sheriff’s office requested assistance in a welfare check on a residence in Mission. The agents joined the deputies at the residence and made contact with the occupants of the home, officials stated. The agents found several suspected illegal aliens inside the home.

Border Patrol agents conducted an immigration interview which revealed the nine migrants inside the home were Chinese nationals illegally present in the U.S., officials said.

The agents placed the nine Chinese migrants under arrest and transported them to the McAllen Station for processing.

Breitbart Texas reports regularly on the abuses of migrants in human smuggling stash houses. Migrants being held in stash houses along the border, and further into the U.S. interior, are frequently abused and extorted for additional smuggling fees. Women are frequently raped and men assaulted while families of the migrants are extorted for additional funds, Border Patrol officials previously stated."

Over the weekend, former Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte sent a tweet tagging Mexican journalist Gabriela Rasgado. Duarte offered “cordial greetings” with a photo of her, another reporter, and the former Veracruz Attorney General Jorge Winckler. Winckler is engaged in a legal battle with incumbent Veracruz Governor Cuitlahuac Garcia over his removal from office. Gov. Cuitlahuac Garcia belongs to an opposing political party led by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO).

Rasgado investigated Duarte and helped expose various instances of corruption during his administration. Duarte is facing federal and state charges related to embezzlement and public corruption. According to Rasgado’s reporting, Gov. Cuitlahuac Garcia appears to be helping Duarte with his legal troubles. The journalist claimed that eight years ago, Duarte blocked her on Twitter when she began to be critical of him. Over the past weekend, he unblocked her and sent the tweet.

“Due to the clear threat sent on Saturday night by Javier Duarte towards me, I blame him, Cuitlahuac Garcia, his close associates and even Mexican President Lopez Obrador of anything that happens to me and my family at this time,” Rasgado said via Twitter.

Mexico has seen 11 murdered journalists in 2019. During Duarte’s term from 2010 to 2016, 19 reporters were killed in Veracruz.

The six adults and five children were stuck south of Del Rio, Texas.

Brackettville Border Patrol Station agents teamed up with Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) agents to rescue a group of migrants who became stranded on a small island in the middle of the Rio Grande shortly after midnight on September 20. The group became stranded after wading across a shallow portion of the river on the Mexican side of the island. When they got to the other side, they found the currents to be too deep and strong to cross safely, according to Del Rio Sector officials.

Agents observed the stranded migrants and advised them to stay on the island until they could safely be moved during daylight. They urged the group, who had children as young as three-years-old, to not enter the current. The agents remained throughout the dark hours.

After sunrise on Friday, BORSTAR agents approached the group with rafts and loaded them safely on board. Once onboard, the agents transported them to the shore where Del Rio Station agents took them into custody and transported them to the station for processing.

Agents reported the group consisted of six adults and five children. The children ranged in age from three to 11. All of the 11 migrants came to the U.S. from El Salvador and Honduras.

“Border Patrol agents continue to warn immigrants not to attempt to cross the Rio Grande River illegally,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz. “On this occasion, help arrived in time to save the lives of these individuals. Unfortunately, not every person attempting to illegally cross the Rio Grande River is so lucky.”

So far this year, nearly 320 migrants died while or shortly after crossing the U.S. border with Mexico, according to the International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrant Project. more than half of those deaths occurred in Texas — more than 20 in the Del Rio Sector, according to the International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrant Project."

The case apparently uncovered a wave of corruption where officials allegedly favor certain criminal organizations over others.

On Sunday, authorities discovered the decapitated body of Jose Antonio Archi Yama, the commander of the Quintana Roo State Police, Noticaribe reported. A group of gunmen from Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) allegedly kidnapped Archi Yama on Thursday, setting off a manhunt as authorities first tried to cover up the case but were eventually forced to confirm the kidnapping and murder.

In a video disseminated through social media, Archi Yama can be seen in police uniform with a rifle as he is apparently forced to claim he had direct orders to fight the CJNG and allow a smaller organization called “Los Rojos” to take over the region. Archi Yama claimed his orders came from Quintana Roo Governor Carlos Joaquin Gonzalez, the state’s top law enforcement official Albert Capella, and another man named Commander Aquiles.

Just hours after authorities recovered Archi Yama’s body, Governor Joaquin Gonzalez took to social media to express outrage and claim he would continue fighting organized crime head-on. Gonzales also said his predecessors did in fact collude with criminal organizations.

Dispatchers with the Brooks County Sheriff’s Office in Falfurrias, Texas, received information on September 13 from Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents about the discovery of a dead migrant on a ranch in the southern part of the county. The ranch is near the town of Encino, Texas, a known drop-off area for human smugglers attempting to move their “human cargo” around the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint located in the center of the county.

Dispatchers sent Deputy Elias Pompa to the ranch where he met up with a Border Patrol agent, a justice of the peace, and a funeral home director, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Brooks County Sheriff’s Office officials.

The Falfurrias Station Border Patrol agent escorted the team 4.7 miles into the ranch. Deputy Pompa learned a Border Patrol agent found the recently deceased migrant while patrolling through the ranch earlier in the day searching for smuggling crews.

Pompa observed the migrant’s body lying face-down under an oak tree. The body appeared intact and had not yet entered an advanced stage of decomposition, according to photographs of the scene.

The man was wearing blue jeans, black boots, a black belt, and a black shirt, the report states. Pompa found three water bottles and some cookies on the ground surrounding the body. During a search, the crew found two backpacks — each containing a wallet. One wallet was found in a plastic bag but was empty. The other contained a prayer card, a phone card, $101, and $1,150 pesos. No identification documents were found with the body.

The justice of the peace made the official death pronouncement and the funeral home worker loaded the remains for transport to the Webb County Medical Examiner’s office in Laredo, Texas. The medical examiner will attempt to identify the body and determine the cause of death.

So far this year, 37 died in this single county in South Texas. This accounts for nearly 20 percent of the more than 190 migrants found dead while or shortly after crossing the Mexican border into Texas, and more than 10 percent of the nearly 320 migrant deaths along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border as reported by the International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrant Report."

For 2019, the Mexican border state abutting Arizona has now suffered 19 police deaths.

A team of state police conducting patrols in colonia Hidalgo in Ciudad Obregón was ambushed by multiple gunmen Sunday at approximately 5:20 pm. The shooters fired numerous rifle rounds from what witnesses described as a white SUV. One officer died at the scene, and the second passed in transit to a local hospital. A third officer and a civilian were wounded by errant fire. The policeman is reported to be in severe condition, according to local reports.

Sonora is seeing a drastic uptick in cartel-related violence as rivals engage in turf disputes leading into the United States. A total of 1,800 Mexican National Guard personnel was deployed in early July throughout the state. The violence is attributed to a dispute between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltran Leyva organization’s regionally aligned gangs, in addition to Sinaloa Cartel infighting.

El Centro Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended a pair of gang members over the weekend who both had been previously deported on multiple occasions. The first incident happened on Saturday night at about 10 p.m. when agents patrolling near the Calexico Port of Entry observed a man illegally crossing from Mexicali, according to El Centro Sector officials.

The agents approached the man about three miles west of the port of entry. They placed the man under arrest and transported him to the Calexico Border Patrol Station for processing and a biometric background investigation.

During the investigation, the agents learned the 42-year-old Mexican national has a previous conviction from a California court for transportation and sale of illegal narcotics. The court sentenced the man to 12 months in prison and five years probation. During processing, the criminal alien admitted to being “a member of the notorious Sureños gang with affiliations to the Florencia 13 gang,” officials reported. The man’s records also showed multiple deportations by immigration officers — most recently in January 2007.

The following morning, Calexico Station agents observed another individual illegally crossing the border about 12 miles east of the Calexico Port of Entry. Officials said this area is frequently used by smuggling organizations due to the “harsh terrain and the short distance to the highway.”

During processing at the station, agents identified the illegal immigrant as a 20-year-old Salvadoran national. His records revealed multiple deportations by immigration officers — the latest in August 2018. His records also indicate his membership in the notoriously violent MS-13 gang.

“The Sureños and MS-13 are amongst the most dangerous and organized gangs out there today,” El Centro Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Ryan J. Scudder said in a written statement. “Fortunately our agents were able to apprehend these gang members safely without further incident.”

Elsewhere on the border, Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents assigned to the Eagle Pass Station conducting line-watch operations apprehended a migrant who illegally crossed the border from Mexico. The agents transported him to the Eagle Pass South Station and conducted a biometric background investigation. The investigation uncovered a violent criminal history including abduction and kidnapping, obstruction of justice, robbery, and felony assault, officials stated. He admitted to Border Patrol agents to being an MS-13 member as well.

All of these criminal alien gang members now face federal charges under 8 USC § 1326 – reentry after deportation. If convicted on the charges, each man could face up to 20 years in federal prison."

Four unidentified male murder victims were gunned down by at least two cartel men inside El Acuario seafood restaurant, according to local reports. The gunmen opened fire on the four without warning while they were seated at a table. The shooters fled the scene, a short distance from the U.S. Consulate in Zona Dorado.

Ten homicides were recorded Friday with an additional 10 over the weekend, according to Alejandro Ruvalcaba Valadez, spokesman for the state attorney general’s office. Among the murder victims were a father and son during a home invasion. The son’s body was discovered a short time later on the side of a road.

Numerous homicide victims were discovered throughout the city, according to authorities. These included two adult males found deceased inside a Honda Civic early Sunday morning in colonia Ladrilleras de Juárez. The pair suffered fatal gunshots by unknown assailants. The victims’ Honda came to a stop in the middle of the road.

Juárez is mired in a turf war between operatives of the Sinaloa Cartel and El Nuevo Cártel de Juárez—”La Linea.” Most of the victims are drug dealers or low-level operatives. These individuals are primarily being supplied methamphetamine by cartel-connected distributors, according to Breitbart law enforcement sources. Juárez netted 1,247 homicides in 2018 and unofficially has eclipsed 1,100 killings in 2019.

Officials report spent more than 30 man-hours processing the group.

A border surveillance camera operator captured images of a group of 81 migrants illegally crossing the border near Sasabe, Arizona, on September 17. The image shows the group is made up largely of migrant families. Small children can be seen talking with adults and being carried.

While much of the southwest border saw a dramatic decline in migrant family apprehensions, the Tucson Sector reported an increase from 1,256 in July to 1,394 in August. This is more than triple last August 2018 when Tucson Sector agents apprehended only 429 migrants. For the first 11 months of FY2018, Tucson Sector agents apprehended 3,859 migrant families units. This year, agents apprehended 14,264 family units during the same period — an increase of 270 percent.

Breitbart Texas reports extensively on the activities of Tucson Sector Border Patrol agents and their efforts to secure the border.

Last week, Tucson Sector agents apprehended a twice-deported Mexican national with two previous convictions for sex with a minor. Despite serving jail time for his offenses, the 33-year-old Mexican national returned to the U.S. He now faces federal prosecution for aggravated illegal re-entry after removal as a child sex offender.

A few days earlier, Tucson Sector agents apprehended another previously deported sex offender, a MS-13 gang member, and an international fugitive wanted in the U.S. for rape and in Mexico for homicide.

“Agents are making significant criminal arrests along the border and we’ll seek prosecution of these individuals accordingly,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement. “U.S. Border Patrol agents remain vigilant and committed to safeguarding our communities.”"

The records come despite agents facing inundating numbers of Central American migrants at historic rates.

With one month to go in the fiscal year, Border Patrol agents seized 85,953 pounds of cocaine and 61,989 pounds of methamphetamine, according to the August CBP Enforcement Statistics Report recently released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

During the migrant crisis, Border Patrol officials in several sectors closed interior checkpoints and moved agents from front-line duties to the care, transportation, feeding, and processing of nearly a half-million migrant families. In the El Paso Sector, where immigration checkpoints were closed during the summer, New Mexico officials called the closures a “green light” for cartels, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. Las Cruces Police Chief Patrick Gallagher blamed a rise in violent crime on the closed checkpoints. Shortly after they re-opened, Border Patrol agents began reporting more seizures.

The seizure of cocaine by Border Patrol agents during the first 11 months of FY2019 nearly doubled the previous year’s total. Methamphetamine when up by nearly 20 percent.

While not at record levels, the seizure of heroin also increased from 568 pounds in all of FY2018 to 661 in FY2019. The high point for the past five years occurred in FY2017 when agents seized 953 pounds.

Cocaine seizures (pounds):

FY 2019 YTD — 11,362

The seizure of marijuana fell by almost 50 percent during FY2019. Fentanyl also fell from 388 pounds in FY2018 to 210 pounds this year.

Following the re-opening of interior checkpoints in the El Paso Sector, Interim Sector Chief Patrol Agent Gloria Chavez reported increases in drug seizures and the apprehension of criminal aliens, including previously deported child sex offenders, Breitbart Texas reported.

“These incidents demonstrate how effective our skilled U.S. Border Patrol agents are when focused on the mission of National Security,” the El Paso Sector chief said in a written statement. “With this temporary reduction of migration flow at the border, our Agents are adding consequences to those involved in criminal activity, resulting in increased interdictions of people being smuggled, detention of criminals, and seizure of narcotics.”"

The driver and her husband entered the camel’s pen after their dog went inside.

The Iberville Parish Sheriff’s Office said surveillance video at the Tiger Tuck Stop in Grosse Tete, Louisiana, showed the truck driver’s husband tossing doggy treats into Caspar the white camel’s pen, the Baton Rouge Advocate reported. The couples dog crawled under the 6 foot fence to go after the treats.

Sheriff’s deputies said the video showed the woman and her husband crawled under the fence to retrieve their dog.

Tiger Truck Stop manager Pamela Bossier said one of the couple shoved the camel and then the husband swatted the camel with his hat. The camel apparently became angered and responded by sitting on the woman, she explained.

“Any animal you provoke, they’re going to strike back,” Bossier said. “It’s instinct.”

The truck driving woman told the deputy she felt she had no means of escape other than to bite the camel’s testicles.

She said, ‘I bit his balls to get him off of me, I bit his testicles to get him off of me,” Iberville Parish Deputy Louis Hamilton Jr. told the Baton Rouge newspaper.

“The camel has never been aggressive, the camel has never gotten out, never caused any issues — in fact, the husband and wife stated before that we’ve been here before and we’ve never had any problems,” the deputy explained.

The Tiger Truck Stop is located about 20 minutes east of Baton Rouge and has been to subject of protests from animal rights groups who complained about a tiger that lived in the compound for 17 years.

The truck stop’s manager said in 30 years, they have never had any animal attacks against their customers.

Deputy Hamilton cited the dog’s owners for a leash law violation.

“And my only question to her husband was, ‘Why did you throw the doggy treat under the fence?’ Deputy Hamilton said. “And he just said, ‘I wasn’t thinking.’”"

A passenger captured the ordeal on a cell phone video as gunmen can be heard and partially seen waving guns at the tourists as they demand wallets and purses.

The brazen robbery took place this weekend in the municipality of El Paraiso in the state of Tabasco when a group of 34 tourists rented a party boat called Bucanero del Sur to celebrate a birthday, Mexico’s Voces de Paraiso reported. One of those tourists captured on cell phone video the moment when a boat pulls up to their vessel and yells out “We are going to be robbed”.

The man hides the cell phone under some sort of cover where the audio is captured, but the images are partially blocked. Moments later, gunmen can be heard and briefly seen waiving handguns as they yell for everyone to give up their wallets and purses or they would be shot. The robbers made a clean getaway. The robbery victims filed a formal complaint with the Tabasco attorney general’s office, Voces de Paraiso reported.

The migrant is the 36th to have lost his life attempting to circumvent the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint on U.S. Highway 281.

Brooks County Sheriff’s Office dispatchers received a call on September 14 from a ranch security officer about the discovery of a dead migrant on a ranch near Encino, Texas, according to information provided by sheriff’s office officials. The area is a well-known migrant drop area for human smugglers.

Callous human smugglers will drop off the migrants on ranches south and southwest of the Falfurrias Border Patrol checkpoint. They give them a limited amount of water and food and send them on a march with a guide that can last for days, Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas. “If one of them becomes injured, overheated, ill, or for any other reason can’t keep up, the guide will simply leave them behind to die,” Sheriff Martinez said.

Two hunting guides working on the ranch found this migrant’s remains under the mesquite-covered brush lying on its his back. Clothing suggests the victim to be a male.

Sheriff’s office dispatchers sent Deputy Robert Castanon to the ranch to recover the remains. He met up with a Border Patrol agent who escorted him 2.25 miles into the ranch to the scene of the migrant’s death.

“I walked over to the skeletal remains in which it still had partial skin attached to its upper and lower back, hands, and feet,” Deputy Castanon wrote in his report.

The deputy observed the migrant’s skull and other bone fragments that had been removed by animals a few yards away from the main parts of the body. Castanon said the migrant wore blue jeans, gray slacks, white socks, a brown belt with a silver buckle, and a blue shirt. The deputy also found a pair of shoes with black soles, a black sweater, black socks, and a black flip phone on the ground near the remains.

No wallet or identifying documents were found with the remains. The deputy photographed the scene and a worker from a local funeral home loaded the remains into a body bag for transport to the Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office in Laredo, Texas. The medical examiner will attempt to identify the cause of death and the migrant’s identity.

So far this year, 37 died in this single county in South Texas. This accounts for nearly 20 percent of the more than 190 migrants found dead while or shortly after crossing the Mexican border into Texas, and more than 10 percent of the more than 300 migrant deaths along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border as reported by the International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrant Report."

Officials said the temperature inside the locked trailer exceeded 100 degrees.

Laredo North Station Border Patrol agents assigned to the Interstate 35 Immigration Checkpoint observed a tractor-trailer approaching for inspection in the northbound lane. During the initial interview with the driver, a K-9 agent alerted to an odor it is trained to detect. The agent referred the driver to a secondary inspection station for investigation, according to information obtained from Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials.

Agents conducted an investigation and opened the rear of the trailer. During the inspection, agents found 53 migrants from Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, officials stated.

The agents observed the temperature inside the trailer at the time of the inspection to be 105 degrees. The agents followed up with a medical evaluation of all 53 illegal aliens and determined that non required medical attention despite the heat.

Officials seized the tractor-trailer rig and placed the driver, a U.S. citizen, under arrest for allegations of human smuggling. All were turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations agents for further investigation.

So far this fiscal year, Border Patrol agents rescued more than 3,000 illegal aliens from life-threatening situations during human smuggling attempts like the one described above, according to Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost.

“The harsh conditions smugglers expose them to often lead to severe injury or death. Tragically, too many have died while being smuggled,” the chief Border Patrol agent tweeted earlier this week.

Last week, Breitbart Texas reported on about 26 migrants being rescued during dangerous human smuggling operations. In one case, a migrant was found locked in the toolbox of a pickup truck with no means of escape.

“Many lives have been lost in horrible conditions caused by smugglers locking immigrants in toolboxes, car trunks, and tractor-trailers,” Del Rio Sector Patrol Agent in Charge Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement. “With temperatures over 100 degrees and no way to escape, this could have ended tragically.”

Border Patrol agents also frequently put their own lives in danger in order to rescue migrants from life-threatening conditions."

The killing is believed to be part of an ongoing turf war between rival criminal gangs.

The Governor, as well as the Director of Public Security of the state of Michoacán, confirmed the identity of a murder victim killed inside Hospital Acueducto in Morelia, Michoacán. The victim, identified as Jesús Cancino Téllez aka “El Apá Michoacano” or “El Chuy Cancino,” is reported to be a high-ranking member of La Familia Michoacána. Cancino Téllez survived an ambush on September 4 in the neighboring state of Querétaro while traveling in a white pickup truck with a driver who died during the attack, according to local reports at the time. Cancino Téllez was allegedly targeted by assassins of the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG).

Officials reportedly transported Cancino Tellez to a local hospital in Querétaro under heavy police guard. According to the director of public security for the state of Michoacán, Israel Patron Reyes, Cancino Téllez was moved from a hospital in Querétaro to the Hospital Acueducto in Morelia, Michoacán this past weekend. Before being transferred, he had been provided heavy security in the Querétaro hospital by elements of the Mexican army and state police.

The attorney general of the State of Querétaro vehemently denied initially that the male transferred from the Querétaro hospital to the hospital in Michoacán was Cancino Tellez. Alejandro Echeverría Cornejo explained to the local media that the name of the victim treated in the Querétaro and later murdered in the hospital in Morelia was purely coincidental.

Breitbart, Texas initially reported the murder of Cancino Téllez. It occurred this past Thursday in Morelia, Michoacán, at Hospital Acueducto. According to witnesses who spoke to local reporters, at least two gunmen entered the building at 7 am and found the victim on the third floor. A gunman pulled a firearm from his waistband and shot the patient execution-style in the presence of doctors and support personnel. The gunman fled without further violence. La Familia Michoacána is involved in a bitter turf war with the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG).

Law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas that three men and one woman died in the shooting. Three other victims sustained multiple injuries. Initial information points to the gunmen being from CJNG and targeting military and police officers who allegedly protected their rivals from La Familia Mexicana.

The shooting comes at a time when CJNG has been taking over key parts of Michoacán unleashing a wave of violence as Los Viagras, and the Familia Michoacana have been trying to hold on to their drug production territories, Breitbart Texas reported.

The discoveries point to an ongoing extermination tactic by cartel members fighting for control of the region. Officials found the remains in wells, shallow pits, and grassy areas as authorities continue to put the pieces back together and identify the victims.

The most recent discovery took place Friday morning in the town of Tala when a local motorist found 17 trash bags filled with human remains that were dumped near a dirt road, information released by the Jalisco Attorney General’s Office revealed. The motorists called authorities who documented the crime scene and gathered the bodies.

On Wednesday, Jalisco state authorities found 19 trash bags containing human remains and clothing in a man-made water reservoir in the rural neighborhood of La Primavera in the municipality of Zapopan — one of the largest cities in Jalisco. The mass grave is less than 1000 feet from another mass grave where, earlier this month, authorities found 119 trash bags containing human remains. In early September, Mexican authorities found 27 bags with more human remains in the municipality of Tlajomulco.

Authorities in Jalisco pieced together some of the remains into more than a dozen complete bodies and several partial ones. Investigators revealed that the bodies were murdered between several days and a year ago.

Jalisco is currently under the control of Mexico’s Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG), one of the leading criminal organizations in Mexico. The cartel earned a reputation for its ruthlessness. In recent months, CJNG has been at war with various other criminal organizations including factions of the Sinaloa Cartel for control of Jalisco and its large shipping ports.

The survivors claimed the attack was carried out by a convoy of gunmen in three SUVs.

The attack took place Thursday afternoon in Guanajuato along the highway that connects Valle De Santiago with Salamanca, not far from the Cereso Mil prison. The guards were escorting various prisoners in a white van. None of the prisoners escaped.

A convoy of at least three vehicles ambushed the police and forced them off the road. The gunmen then surrounded the van and began shooting rifles, killing four guards while a fifth ran away. He managed to run into a nearby field where he played dead until the attack ended.

Various cartels are fighting for control of Guanajuato and its prisons. In February, gunmen ambushed and killed the head of prison guards for Cereso Mil as he was driving his son to school. Currently, authorities believe the gunmen were trying to kill one of the leading prison security officers who was in the vehicle Thursday.

Moments after the attack, the Guanajuato Public Security Secretary took to social media to condemn the attack, however, other state officials have not released an official statement.

Mi más sentido pésame para familiares, compañer@s y amig@s de los guardias de seguridad penitenciaria que perdieron hoy la vida. La @SeguridadGto está de luto. Comprometemos nuestros mayores esfuerzos para que se castigue a los responsables y este crimen no quede impune. pic.twitter.com/BBc32AYZAM — Alvar Cabeza de Vaca (@AlvarCdeV) September 19, 2019

The deadly ambush comes days after a group of cartel gunmen injured the regional head for Mexico’s National Intelligence Commission in a similar attack, where one of his bodyguards died. The highways in Guanajuato are deemed as some of the most dangerous in Mexico.

“Right now we’re at a pace of about a mile a day. And we’ll see that continue to go up,” said Pentagon Chief Spokesman Jonathan Hoffman during a press briefing Thursday.

President Trump traveled to the southwest earlier this week to view progress on the border wall.

“Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we’re building it at a breakneck speed,” he said Wednesday in San Diego during a press conference.

GREAT progress on the Border Wall! pic.twitter.com/TvOYxgsBSv — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019

Hoffman also announced Thursday that nearly all of the $2.5 billion military counter-drug money that was allocated to the border wall in February has been obligated and is now on contract, and that the rest of that money, $3 million, would be obligated next week. That $2.5 billion will go towards border projects in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.

“That is going to build 129 miles of wall — all of that money is on contract as of — I think there’s $3 million left — and that’ll be by the end of next week. All of that money is on contract,” Hoffman said.

Hoffman also confirmed that the Pentagon is making progress on border projects with another pot of money — the $3.6 billion that Defense Secretary Mark Esper transferred from military construction to the border wall earlier this month.

He said the Department of Interior (DOI) recently transferred about 650 acres of land, or 70 miles of border, to the Army, so that the Army Corps of Engineers can start building another 175 miles of border wall.

“Right now we’re getting the first of those contracts ready to go…we have property from DOI that needed to be transferred over for a number of those so we got to work through that process, and it’s going to take months to get that,” he said.

“But our goal is that by the end of next year, we will have completed over 450 miles of wall construction all-told, across the federal government,” he said.

Hoffman said he expected the pace of building to increase over time.

“What you’re going to see is … it’ll take a little awhile, as we do the planning, we buy the property, we do the environmental assessment, and all the other things and assessments that we need to do, and you’ll see a rapid increase in the amount,” he said.

On Wednesday, Army Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, gave an update on the border projects overall.

“Sixty-six miles today are already completed. There’s 251 miles that are under contract, going in the ground right now at 17 other sites,” he said at the press conference on Wednesday with Trump.

“There’s 163 miles that are actually on contracts that are going to be [awarded] in the next 90 days,” he said. “The remainder of the miles the President talked about is mainly private land that takes a little bit longer to get.”"

The charges against the judge stem from an incident where she allegedly allowed a criminal alien to avoid arrest while in court.

Massachusetts District Court Judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph and trial court officer Wesley MacGregor face prosecution from the federal government following an incident earlier this year, Breitbart News’ Neil Munro reported. The judge allegedly allowed a twice-deported illegal alien charged with a narcotics violation to avoid arrest by ICE officers by slipping out the back door of the courtroom. The judge allegedly kept immigration officers waiting outside the front doors while allowing the fugitive to flee. A federal grand jury handed down an indictment for “conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of a federal proceeding.”

Earlier this week, a group of 61 retired judges from Massachusetts filed an amicus brief in support of the defendants.

“The prosecution at issue in this case, if permitted to go forward, will irrevocably tip the scales of justice because it will undermine the very authorities that make balance possible,” the retired judges wrote, according to a report by Law.com. “As argued in Joseph’s motion to dismiss, the prosecution is contrary to law.”

The group of 61 said the prosecution would “set a bad precedent,” the legal news website reported.

The retired judges said the prosecution “portends an unacceptable risk of criminal jeopardy that inevitably will chill the ability of state court judges to insure equal justice under the law without fear or favor to any person or point of view,” according to the brief.

Prosecutors with the Department of Justice responded to the brief stating the arguments appear to match those made by the judge’s attorney. Those attorneys reportedly claimed the judge has immunity against prosecution for what she considered to be “courtroom management.”

“Two capable law firms representing Judge Joseph have submitted an exhaustive 31-page brief raising numerous legal arguments in support of their client’s motion,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew Lelling wrote in response to the brief. ”The committee’s proposed brief merely echoes the judicial immunity argument already fully developed in Judge Joseph’s brief.”

In the underlying offense, prosecutors stated:

The Officer announced his presence to Courthouse personnel, including Joseph, upon arrival. Prior to the afternoon session, the courtroom clerk – at Joseph’s direction – allegedly instructed the ICE Officer to leave the courtroom and wait outside in the lobby, stating that in the event that the defendant was released, it would be through the courtroom and into the lobby. At 2:48 p.m. the case was called and the proceedings were captured on the courtroom’s audio recorder, as prescribed under the rules for all State District Courts. The audio recording captured Joseph, the defense attorney and the ADA speaking at side bar about the defendant and the ICE detainer. Joseph then allegedly ordered the courtroom clerk to “go off the record for a moment.” For the next 52 seconds, the courtroom audio recorder was turned off, in violation of the District Court rules. At 2:51 p.m., the recorder was turned back on, and Joseph indicated her intent to release the defendant. According to the charging documents, the defense attorney asked to speak with the defendant downstairs and Joseph responded, “That’s fine. Of course.” When reminded by the clerk that an ICE Officer was in the courthouse, Joseph stated, “That’s fine. I’m not gonna allow them to come in here. But he’s been released on this.” Immediately following the proceeding, MacGregor allegedly escorted the defendant, his attorney and an interpreter downstairs to the lockup and used his security access card to open the rear sally-port exit and release the defendant at 3:01 p.m.

Members of the Newton City Council voted in February 2017 to declare their municipality a sanctuary, Breitbart News reported.

Earlier this year, U.S. Attorney Lelling said, “We cannot pick and choose the federal laws we follow, or use our personal views to justify violating the law. Everyone in the justice system – not just judges, but law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and defense counsel – should be held to a higher standard. The people of Massachusetts expect that, just like they expect judges to be fair, impartial and to follow the law themselves.”"

At the time of the shootout, the gunmen kept the body of an unidentified man in the trunk of a vehicle. It remains unclear when the man died.

The shooting took place Wednesday afternoon near rural Fresnillo when Nuevo Leon state police spotted a black Chevrolet Tahoe without license plates, Nuevo Leon’s Fuerza Civil revealed. Moments after spotting the officers, cartel gunmen began shooting as they tried to drive away.

Officers chased the men as they exchanged fire until the gunmen crashed against the wall of a home. The gunmen continued to shoot at authorities until all three died.

Authorities searched the vehicle and discovered a handcuffed body with tape around the head. It remains unclear if the victim died during the shootout or beforehand.

The rural area is under the control of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas, which carries out highway robberies between Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo. The region has also seen a large number of mass graves that CDN-Los Zetas gunmen used to bury kidnapping victims.

“Not a perfect country, but one thing is inarguable: America wasn’t founded to be an authoritarian state. Impeach Trump. We’re accountable to the law. He must be. Hammer him,” Westworld star Jeffery Wright said. “Trump and any other Americans who favor authoritarianism can find another country.”

Actress and Scorpion star Katherine McPhee said “Speaker Pelosi do your thing sis #ImpeachTrump.”

Calls for impeachment reached a fever pitch last week after reports surfaced of a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which President Trump said he’d withhold military aid to Ukraine unless the country launched a probe into Hunter Biden’s business transactions in the country while his father, former Vice President Joe Biden was in office.

President Trump announced Tuesday that he directed White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold the millions in military aid from Ukraine a week before his call with Zelensky. Trump also tweeted Tuesday that he would release the full transcript of his phone call with Zelensky.

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” President Trump said.

Political experts have long-argued that House Democrats don’t have the required votes to pass articles of impeachment against President Trump. Democrats need 218 votes for impeachment in the House. They face an even steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. As Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry, Democrats have just about 175 votes despite their 235-seat majority. Today’s move by Pelosi may help encourage Democrats in her caucus who fear the political backlash a vote to impeach Trump might bring.

That’s math that’s not likely to slow Hollywood leftists’ calls to oust President Trump.

“Thank you, Nancy Pelosi,” belted Rosie O’Donnell. “I never thought this day would come!”

The Hollywood celebrations are rolling in. Check it all out below.

The fake story, which ran Wednesday afternoon, claims:

The acting Director of National Intelligence [Joseph Maguire] threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.

The story was published just hours after the White House released the transcript of a call between Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. The transcript debunked the latest Media-Democrat hoax that claims Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The actual transcript shows no such thing, and during a press conference with Trump on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president confirmed he was not pressured.

Just moments after the Post’s phony story ran, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement on Twitter that says of the Post story, “This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.”

This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond. This is actually not true.

A few moments later, Maguire himself released a statement debunking the Post’s fake news: “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community…”

Throughout the nearly three years of the media’s Russia Collusion Hoax, along with CNN and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, the Post was one of the leading purveyors of fake news, including a ludicrous story about the Russians hacking into a Vermont power grid.

Then there was the Post’s now-debunked claim the Obama administration did not spy on Trump (it did), and the phony claim the Trump campaign changed its platform on Ukraine to appease Putin (it didn’t). On top of that nonsense was the Post’s ludicrous fake news about Russia hacking the election systems of 21 states, the claim there is a lot of evidence of Trump-Russia collusion (there is none), the whopper about Trump revealing classified information to the Russians (he did not), and this extra large whopper: “Rudy Giuliani just told America that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia.”

The full list is here.

Publishing a flurry of fake news as one of its hoaxes collapses, in this case the Ukraine Hoax, is standard operating procedure for the Washington Post and the rest of our crooked news media. The idea is to distract from the debunking of the primary hoax with a chaos narrative that hurls anything against the wall. This garbage never sticks, but it does allow our fake media to hold on to the dream that they really got Drumpf this time a little while longer.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the “ground has shifted” towards the support of the impeachment of President Donald Trump.

She argued it was because “this Ukraine allegation is incredibly serious and very urgent.”

Ocasio-Cortez said, “The Judiciary Committee has long been investigating many of the violations of the president, but this Ukraine allegation is head and shoulders one of the most serious and urgent allegations that we have seen come out of this administration to date. And so I think it’s completely understandable that we’ve seen this. I think it’s an allegation that frankly has united more members of the party on impeachment than any other. So for that, I think it’s an understandable decision that we make. That being said, I do think it’s important that we continue to tell the story of the other violations, whether it’s emoluments, whether it’s having diplomats staying at Trump properties. I think all of these things need to be looked into, but this Ukraine allegation is incredibly serious and very urgent.”

She continued, “What also makes this urgent is that this is about something that is going to happen — the 2020 election. We have the opportunity to act now to prevent a profoundly destabilizing action, an intervention in our democracy before it happens. I think that is a profoundly urgent action that we need to take right now and everything else is just as serious. All of these transgressions against our democracy are extremely serious, but we are investigating things unfortunately that have already happened. When it comes to Ukraine, we are talking about potentially meddling in the 2020 election that has still yet to happen.”

She added, “This is completely different. What we are talking about here is the president essentially participating in what looks like a series of events that looks like extortion. Withholding aid to an ally and then, quote-unquote, asking for a favor to essentially benefit yourself politically, not in the interest of the United States of America, but in the interest of your own reelection.”

She concluded, “I think the ground has shifted. I don’t believe in making decisions based on polling. I believe in our ability to organize the public, to educate the public, to talk to the public about why not just we as members of Congress must impeach the president but why all people in the United States of America must recognize and understand that we need to put our country first before our considerations of reelection. And that goes from members of Congress all the way up to the president of the United States.”

“If failed policies and leadership leading to the murder of schoolchildren and trying to become famous off of a tragedy you enabled and then lying about it again and again aren’t enough to get a guy in government fired these days, then America is basically doomed,” Pollack told Breitbart News.

Sheriff Israel was widely criticized for his department’s poor response to the shooting, after a deputy failed to enter the school during the shooting, and after it was discovered the department had failed to arrest the shooter despite dozens of visits to his foster home and school disciplinary problems.

The sheriff praised his own job performance, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper that he had shown “amazing leadership.” He also participated in a highly politicized CNN town hall on gun control shortly after the shooting.

Newly-elected Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, removed Israel from his post in January and replaced him with Coral Springs Police Sgt. Gregory Tony, the first black sheriff in the county.

The South Florida Sun-Sentinel noted Wednesday that Israel’s reinstatement would still need to be approved by the state senate, and that the “special master” in charge of the case found that Gov. DeSantis had acted in good faith. Still, the investigation found that Sheriff Israel was not personally responsible for individual failures on his watch. The state senate, which is controlled by Republicans, will consider the issue in a special session the week of Oct. 21.

Pollack has written a new book, Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies That Created The Parkland Shooter and Endanger America’s Students, in which he criticizes the local police, the school district, and other authorities for their policies — and offers recommendations for parents who wish to take action to ensure their own children remain safe in school.

Waters said, “The Speaker of the House of Representatives is now onboard for a formalized impeachment inquiry. And she has her caucus support in doing so. That’s extremely different.”

She continued, You’re absolutely right. I started a long time ago, right after the president was inaugurated, talking about impeachment and saying that he was dishonorable, he was a conman, we could not trust him. And of course I was way ahead of all this and nobody really took me seriously, but I also knew that this president was so brazen and so disrespectful of the Constitution that he was going to continue to abuse the presidential power. And so he’s done just that, and now I think in everything that we have discovered in the past, it does not even measure up to what we have just discovered over the past few days about him and his attempt to leverage and get the president of Ukraine to do his bidding and find dirt on his political opponent, and so all of this is different.”

During a segment on CNN’s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, political analyst Nia-Malika Henderson claimed that McCarthy is not “eager” to talk to the media about Trump’s call with Zelensky, whereas it has been confirmed that the two did not discuss military aid to Ukraine as first claimed by a whistleblower.

Henderson said:

Over these last few days, obviously you’ve seen a slew of Democrats get off the sidelines, call for this impeachment inquiry. This call, which is very damaging to this president in terms of the light it puts him in, right. Essentially, bringing up this aid, then asking for a favor, so we don’t know. There’s a been this kind of conventional wisdom that the president wanted this, that he feels like this would energize his base, that this would kind of bind the Republican Party to this president. But you saw today Kevin McCarthy … was asked in the hallway about this call. He wasn’t too eager to come before cameras and talk about this. This is an unfortunate set of facts for Republicans. [Emphasis added]

The claim by Henderson, though, is false, as McCarthy just today spoke to Breitbart News, where he talked directly about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s effort to impeach Trump over the Ukraine call.

Similarly, McCarthy joined Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday night to discuss the Democrats’ plans to impeach Trump. In statements to Breitbart News, McCarthy said the impeachment plan will backfire on Democrats in the 2020 presidential election.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” McCarthy said. “Two hundred and sixty-six days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”

A whistleblower from the intelligence community, with confirmed political bias against the president, claimed that Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky included a violation of federal campaign finance laws. The accusation claimed that Trump had threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky’s government investigated former Vice President and 2020 candidate Joe Biden for corruption.

A full transcript released by the Trump administration of the phone call, however, reveals that while Biden was mentioned multiple times in the conversation, neither the president nor Zelensky talked about the authorization of military aid.

Despite the transcript disproving the whistleblower’s initial allegations against Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) and House Democrats have now committed to impeaching the president.

Cook, who rarely posts online, wrote on Twitter that all the hype of the Trump-Ukraine call transcript among elected Democrats and establishment media pundits will not translate into any kind of political movement in the 2020 election:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters. [Emphasis added]

While Pelosi and House Democrats focus on impeaching Trump over the Ukraine phone call, voters have repeatedly told pollsters that their top issues are immigration, the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, and job creation in the American economy.

As Breitbart News reported, elected Democrats wrote to the Ukrainian government in May of last year to request they continue investigating Trump for alleged Russian collusion during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“I think you read everything,” he replied. “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections, elections of USA.”

Zelensky and Trump spoke to the press ahead of a bilateral meeting in New York City, during the annual United Nations assembly.

Zelensky described the call as “normal,” and that “nobody pushed me.”

Trump agreed. “In other words, no pressure,” he added.

The president began the press availability with a joke, “He’s made me more famous and I’ve made him more famous,” Trump said.

The Ukrainian president invited President Trump to visit Ukraine, noting that former President Barack Obama “never found the time.”

Trump said he would “try” to visit, but did not commit.

Zelensky said Ukraine was fighting two wars, one against corruption and the second fighting to get back territories annexed by Russia.

Trump said that the former vice president’s son Hunter Biden was guilty of corruption in Ukraine and China. He continued:

When Biden’s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and he knows nothing and they’re paying him millions of dollars, that’s corruption, when Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion dollars in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China. And he’s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think it’s a horrible thing.

Trump also reminded him that Russian took Crimea during the Obama administration, and urged Europe to do more to help Ukraine.

“We don’t need help, we need support, real support,” Zelensky replied. “Only together America and EU, only together we can stop the war.”"

“The Amazon/Washington Post just put out a fake article that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who I’ve gotten to know and he’s a tough cookie and I was surprised, I was shocked to hear this, was going to quit,” Trump said.

The Post reported that Maguire threatened to step down if he was not allowed to testify to Congress on Thursday.

Trump referred to a statement from Maguire whom he said denied the report.

“At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019,” Maguire said in a statement. “I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham also blasted the Post for running with the story without getting comment from the White House.

“This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the Washington Post had given us more than six minutes (literally) to respond,” she said on Twitter."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) unveiled a “major project” designed to combat poverty on Wednesday dubbed, “A Just Society,” which – in part – gives illegal immigrants access to federal public benefits.

The proposal is six-fold, with each section aiming to combat poverty at a slightly different angle. The proposal includes giving illegal immigrants access to federal public benefits such as Medicaid, NPR reports.

“Immigrants pay taxes, and when we begin to unify our systems, I think that we will get more cohesive immigration policy, economic policy, political policy,” Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR.

“And I think it sends a message that if you contribute to our society, you should benefit from our society. Why should a billionaire who evades taxes collect Social Security, too?” she asked.

“I think that what we can do is we can tighten up our systems and increase accountability,” she continued, adding that her proposal sends the message that the U.S. will “not discriminate solely based on immigration status.”

Her “six-piece suite” includes:

Recognizing Poverty Act

Place to Prosper Act

Mercy in Re-Entry

Embrace Act

Uplift Our Workers Act

Ratify the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, & Cultural Rights

The Recognizing Poverty Act would, according to Ocasio-Cortez, “update the national poverty guidelines in order for us to acknowledge modern life.” That includes childcare and “new necessities” like Internet access.

The Place to Prosper Act gives access to a “counsel fund” for renters who are facing eviction and “imposes a national cap of 3% on annual rent increases and begins to pursue penalties” on what the freshman lawmaker calls “abusive and predatory landlords.”

Additionally, the Mercy in Re-Entry act extends the “social safety net” to former convicts who “duly paid their debt to society,” while the Embrace Act expands entitlement benefits to illegal immigrants. The Uplift Our Workers Act directs the federal government to “prefer doing business with worker-friendly contractors” based on a “worker-friendly score,” which Ocasio-Cortez likens to LEED certification.

She also urges Congress to ratify the U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social, & Cultural Rights, which recognizes the right to “take part in cultural life” as well as the right to “enjoy the benefits of scientific progress.” It also recognizes the right to “an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.”

“In a modern, moral, and wealthy society, no person should be too poor to live,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “That’s what a just society means to me”:

Big day! We’re rolling out our next major project: A Just Society. It’s a 6-piece suite: 1. Recognizing Poverty Act

2. Place to Prosper Act

3. Mercy in Re-Entry Act

4. Embrace Act

5. Uplift Our Workers Act

6. Ratify the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, & Cultural Rights ⬇️ https://t.co/nPhVxIy7fQ — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 25, 2019

“I am both energized and humbled to introduce legislation today to build upon the most transformative programs of the last century,” Ocasio-Cortez said of her proposal in a statement.

“From the New Deal to the Great Society, we have shown time and again that our nation is capable of implementing big ideas and bold solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face,” she continued.

“We must once again recognize the breadth and consequences of poverty in this country and work together to ensure a path forward to economic freedom for everyone,” she added."

Gabbard said, “I think most people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president that won an election in 2016. And instead what I think most people will see is, hey, this is another move by Democrats to get rid of Donald Trump, further deepening the already hyperpartisan divides that we have in this country. And that’s really where I’m coming from. Look, Donald Trump is corrupt. He is unfit to serve our country as president. He is unqualified to serve our country as commander-in-chief. I’m running for president to defeat him. I just think it’s so important for our country to be able to move forward, to bridge these divides, that it be the American people that make this decision.”

She added that the transcript does show Trump “using his position for his own political gain. I think that’s very clear. It’s also not surprising.”

Here are three prime examples:

1. Punishing Trump for “colluding” … with an ally

Out: Trump colluded with Russia! In: Trump colluded with Russia’s enemy! — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 25, 2019

One of the forces driving the “Russia collusion” narrative was the idea that Trump was a stooge for Russian President Vladimir Putin because he was open to a better relationship. That assumption covered media reporting on everything that Trump did or said about Russia. Now, however, Trump has been “caught” colluding with Russia’s enemy, Ukraine — whose president even acknowledged that the Trump administration had been very helpful with defense (against Russia). The media have not stopped examine the stupidity of their prior (wrong) accusations.

2. Accusing Trump of hiding … a report about the evidence

Out: Forget the report, we need the underlying evidence! In: Forget the underlying evidence, we need the report! — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 25, 2019

The calls for impeachment began in earnest when Democrats accused Attorney General William Barr of covering up Trump’s misbehavior by withholding the “underlying evidence” in the Mueller investigation. They even held him in contempt of Congress — though he could not, by law, release everything they wanted. Now Trump has produced the “underlying evidence” — the transcript — and they will not be satisfied until they see the “whistleblower” report.

3. Targeting Trump for ensuring … the integrity of our election

Out: we need to know if a candidate is compromised by a foreign government! In: how dare you ask if a candidate is compromised by a foreign government! — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 25, 2019

Democrats tried to justify the Obama administration’s surveillance of Trump campaign associates by arguing that the government had to ensure that Trump was not “compromised” by a foreign government. Now Trump is being attacked for trying to get to the bottom of credible suspicions of corruption by Biden, who could become president.

The poll by Quinnipiac University published Wednesday showed that 37 percent of voters said President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent said he should not be impeached. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.

The poll was conducted from Thursday through Monday, as reports were emerging that alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president during a phone call to investigate Joe Biden’s son for his business dealings in Ukraine in exchange for military aid.

Those reports prompted a rush of moderate House Democrats and other holdouts to support an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

More than 60 Democrats came out in favor of impeachment on Monday and Tuesday, bringing the total of Democrats who support it to 204. The House needs 218 to impeach Trump.

The numbers of Americans supporting impeachment have hovered around 37 percent for months, according to recent polls.

However, Democrats are betting that allegations around Ukraine will sway the American public to back impeachment.

In an ominous sign for Democrats that it will not, Charlie Cook of the non-partisan Cook Political Report tweeted:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters.

While identified as the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a multi-continental cocaine trafficking syndicate run out of the Venezuelan military, Cabello is in Pyongyang in the capacity of an envoy for dictator Nicolás Maduro, who has not been the lawful head of state of Venezuela since January. Cabello is widely considered the second most powerful man in Venezuela and, through the years, has been the subject of speculation that those closest to Maduro are planning to overthrow him. Cabello has yet to make any public acts in defiance of Maduro, however.

Cabello is also the host of a television show on Venezuelan state television, which he uses to denigrate pro-democracy dissidents and the United States.

Cabello is making his journey as most of the world’s heads of state convene in New York for the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly. Despite not being legally Venezuela’s president, the U.N. invited Maduro to attend, but he declined.

Dictator Kim Jong-un will also be among the few world leaders not to attend the General Assembly.

Venezuela’s foreign ministry posted images of Cabello landing in North Korea on Tuesday for what it called a “high-level visit.”

The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Pyongyang’s state propaganda outlet, reported that Cabello and his team spent part of the day worshipping at the statues of Kim’s father and grandfather, the dictators Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-il, before the current communist tyrant hosted a “reception” to honor Venezuela’s “Bolivarian Revolution.” Cabello and his team also held talks with “Pak Thae Song, chairman of the DPRK [North Korea] Supreme People’s Assembly,” his counterpart in North Korea’s puppet legislature.

“Addressing the event [the reception], Pak Thae Song said that the Party, government, and people of Venezuela are achieving successes in the struggle for the victorious advance of the Bolivarian revolution, foiling the sanctions and sabotages by hostile forces,” KCNA reported. “He expressed belief that the militant friendship and fraternal ties forged between the two countries on the road of anti-imperialist independence would invariably grow stronger.”

KCNA did not offer any details on what Cabello was discussing with the North Koreans or what policies they agreed to advance together. Lisandro Solórzano, a member of the PSUV, hinted at Cabello’s meeting being necessary to “strengthen cooperative ties in various strategic areas” on Twitter.

Maduro typically uses Cabello to intimidate and silence enemies, not as an envoy. Cabello most recently stood atop a reported purge of the PSUV after Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó announced in May that he had convinced senior Maduro henchmen to defect. While Guaidó’s attempt to acquire his constitutional powers failed, Maduro reportedly ordered Cabello to sweep any suspected traitors out of the party.

Cabello appears to be in North Korea as a substitute because top diplomat, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, is in New York currently with Vice President Delcy Rodríguez for the U.N. General Assembly. Maduro himself landed in Moscow on Tuesday to ask Russia for more money to prop up his failed state.

Defecting senior members of both Maduro’s regime and the previous Hugo Chávez have accused Cabello of being the head of an international cocaine trafficking scheme. Leamsy Salazar, Chávez’s former security chief, said in 2015 that he personally witnessed Cabello order shipments of “tons of cocaine” throughout the Western Hemisphere. The Wall Street Journal published multiple reports detailing Cabello’s activities as a drug lord and later won a lawsuit against Cabello when the latter sued for defamation, on the grounds of the reports not being proven false.

In May, the U.S. Treasury Department branded Cabello a specially designated person, limiting his potential economic activities in the United States, over his engagement in drug trafficking.

“The Venezuelan people suffer under corrupt politicians who tighten their grip on power while lining their own pockets. We are imposing costs on figures like Diosdado Cabello who exploit their official positions to engage in narcotics trafficking, money laundering, embezzlement of state funds, and other corrupt activities,” Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said at the time. “This Administration is committed to holding those accountable who violate the trust of the Venezuelan people, and we will continue to block attempts to abuse the U.S. financial system.”

North Korea and Venezuela have been close allies since the Chávez era. The head of North Korea’s puppet legislature, Kim Yong Nam, visited Caracas most recently in November, signing several diplomatic agreements alongside Cabello. North Korea has used its state propaganda outlets to repeatedly denounce America as “sinister” and “reckless” for condemning Maduro’s long list of human rights atrocities against his people. North Korean officials have also visited Venezuela to offer “financial advice” to the starving nation, despite North Korea’s lamentable economic state.

Speech,"A member of the delegation to the U.N. from Venezuela’s illegitimate socialist regime pretended to read a book while President Donald Trump spoke at the institution’s General Assembly general debate on Tuesday.

The delegate identified herself as Daniela Rodríguez and posted on Twitter that she was pretending to read the writings of Simón Bolívar, the founder of Venezuela. Bolívar wrote prolifically against the United States in the 19th century.

Trump spent a significant portion of his speech warning the world against the evils of communism and socialism, and particularly condemning the regime of dictator Nicolás Maduro for plunging Venezuela into extreme poverty and using human rights abuses to repress political dissidents.

Maduro will not attend the U.N. General Assembly despite being invited, sending instead Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza. The U.N. insisted on inviting Maduro despite him no longer holding the office of the presidency. His term expired in January, but he refused to step down, so the National Assembly used its constitutional powers to replace him with an interim president, Juan Guaidó.

Guaidó announced that he had sent a delegation to the U.N. General Assembly on Monday despite not being invited.

Rodríguez, the socialist delegate, posted a photo of herself on Twitter reading a book with the falsified socialist image of Bolívar – created by Hugo Chávez after exhuming the founding father’s corpse in 2012 – on its cover.

“While infamy and lies speak before the U.N., we read Bolívar: ‘The United States seems destined by providence to plague America with misery in the name of liberty,'” Rodríguez wrote.

Her boss Jorge Arreaza – Hugo Chávez’s son-in-law – applauded her on social media, as well.

“The best response against imperialist and supremacist aggression from Donald Trump is to submerge ourselves in our pure, luminous, sovereign fountain of independence, equality, and liberty: SIMÓN BOLÍVAR, THE LIBERATOR,” Arreaza wrote on Twitter:

During Rodríguez’s stunt, Trump condemned Maduro’s regime while assuring the Venezuelan people that “all of America is behind you” and that America had “vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready to be delivered.” Venezuela has been suffering severe food shortages and almost a total lack of basic medications for at least two years. Maduro has repeatedly rejected American humanitarian aid. On one occasion, socialist Vice President Delcy Rodríguez went on Maduro’s propaganda broadcast network and told Venezuelans that American food aid was “carcinogenic” and not safe to eat.

“Women in Venezuela stand in line for ten hours a day waiting for food,” Trump told the General Assembly. “Over 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners. Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings.”

Trump referred to Maduro as a “Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people.”

More generally, Trump referred to socialism and communism as “the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies.”

“Events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the people,” he continued. “Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class.”

While Trump was speaking, the State Department announced new sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry. Specifically, Washington levied sanctions on four companies working with Maduro’s oil industry and blocked the travel of four vessels used to transport Venezuelan oil.

“This action further targets Venezuela’s oil sector and the mechanisms used to transport oil to Nicolás Maduro’s Cuban benefactors, who continue to prop up the former regime,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said. “These sanctions are a follow-on to the designations and identifications announced on April 5 and 12 that targeted entities and vessels known to be involved in the transportation of crude oil from Venezuela to Cuba.”

Nicolás Maduro is currently in Moscow to “secure our historic and very positive relations of exchange and respect between our peoples.”

Russia’s Foreign Relations Ministry published a photo Tuesday of Maduro standing alongside President Vladimir Putin. Maduro appeared to continue using Twitter to condemn the world’s free societies, taking time out of his diplomatic schedule to accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of “fascism” for condemning “sensationalist” media reports on fires in the Amazon Rainforest that circulated in August.

General Assembly on Tuesday that European nations pressuring the world to violate his nation’s sovereignty in defense of the Amazon Rainforest were guilty of “colonialism” and environmentalists were guilty of viewing indigenous Brazilians as “cavemen.”

Bolsonaro addressed an audience that included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country he specifically identified as using as much as half of its territory for agriculture, threatening its natural ecosystem. He named France along with Germany in this assessment and, although he did not name French President Emmanuel Macron, he protested against attempts at this year’s G-20 Summit to stage a global intervention on Brazil which were led by Macron.

Íntegra do discurso, abrindo a Assembléia Geral da ONU 2019. https://t.co/QPMGSh4uYu — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) September 24, 2019

Macron and Bolsonaro have an increasingly acrimonious relationship trigged by Macron accusing Bolsonaro of destroying the Amazon Rainforest. The relationship soured further then Bolsonaro replied to a supporters’ insults against French First Lady Brigitte Macron by laughing.

“The United Nations performed a key role in overcoming colonialism in the past,” Bolsonaro said on Tuesday. “It must not allow this mindset to come back to its halls no matter what pretext.”

Bolsonaro noted that in late August and September, early spring months in the Southern Hemisphere, fires are common in South America, both natural forest fires and artificial ones intended to clear land for farming. “There are forest fires that are part of the ordinary practice of indigenous peoples in the local populations as part of their culture,” he noted. He described global coverage of the fires this year as “sensationalist attacks” and directly rejected Macron’s description of the Amazon Rainforest as “the lungs of the world” as a “fallacy.”

“These sensationalist attacks that we have suffered coming from a large part of the international media … have aroused our patriotic sentiment,” Bolsonaro noted. “It is a fallacy to say that the Amazon is the heritage of humankind.”

“Certain countries, instead of helping, embarked on the media lies and behaved in a disrespectful manner and a colonialist spirit,” he noted.

Bolsonaro thanked American President Donald Trump personally for rejecting the “absurd proposal” of sanctioning Brazil for environmental damage proposed at the G-20 summit by Macron and other European leaders.

“My administration has solemnly committed itself to environmental preservation and sustainable development. …

Brazil is one of the world’s richest countries in biodiversity and mineral resources; our Amazonian region is larger than all of Western Europe and remains pristine … we are one of the countries that most protects the environment,” the president said.

“France and Germany use up more than 50 percent of their territories for agriculture. In contrast, Brazil uses no more than 8 percent,” Bolsonaro said. “61 percent of our territory is preserved.”

Bolsonaro insisted that the Amazon Rainforest “is not being devastated or consumed by fire” and invited attendees to visit it personally to see the reality for themselves.

Bolsonaro also condemned “radical extreme environmentalists … that are out of sync with what indigenous people truly want” for attempting to combat attempted to help indigenous communities with economic development.

“Our natives are human beings just like any of us here. They want and they deserve to enjoy the same rights as all of us,” he insisted, accusing environmentalists of having “stubbornly insisted in keeping our indigenous people living like cavemen.”

“The indigenous people do not want to be poor,” Bolsonaro said.

Elsewhere in the speech, the Brazilian president celebrated that Brazil had returned “from the brink of socialism” and warned the world that leftist ideology brings with it only “cruelty,” death, and extreme poverty. He thanked God on several occasions for his life, noting that a socialist agitator had nearly stabbed him to death a year ago.

General Assembly, on Tuesday, warning against the “cruelty of socialism” and accusing the U.N. itself of engaging in slave labor.

Bolsonaro made the accusation in relation to Cuba’s slave doctor system, in which the communist regime forces doctors to work without pay abroad, taking almost the entirety of their salaries and investing them in the luxury lifestyles of the regime’s leaders. The doctors are expected to live off of a “stipend” that many say often fails to cover basic food needs. Cuba makes an estimated $11 billion off of the slave doctor trade in deals with African, Latin American, and Pacific Island states.

Íntegra do discurso, abrindo a Assembléia Geral da ONU 2019. https://t.co/QPMGSh4uYu — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) September 24, 2019

One of Bolsonaro’s first acts after taking office in January was to end the Brazilian Cuban slave doctor program, known as Mais Médicos (“More Doctors”). Bolsonaro demanded that Cuba give a reasonable salary to its doctors from the payments that Brasilia makes Havana, prompting the regime to end the program entirely.

In New York, Bolsonaro noted that U.N. bodies like the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) openly aid and benefit from the Cuban slave doctor trade.

“In 2013, an agreement between the former[ly ruling] Workers’ Party [PT] and the Cuban dictatorship brought to Brazil 10,000 doctors,” Bolsonaro explained. The agreement “prevented [the doctors] from bringing their spouses or children and 75 percent of their wages were confiscated by the Cuban regime.”

“They were further prevented from enjoying fundamental rights like, for example, coming and going [from Brazil,” Bolsonaro noted. “It is truly tantamount to slave labor.”

Bolsonaro made clear that this slave labor was “supported by human rights organizations in Brazil and United Nations organizations.”

The PAHO was a signatory to the deal between Brazil and Cuba that created Mais Médicos. Inviting PAHO to participate in the deal would allow the then-socialist government of Brazil not to have to put the plan to import thousands of Cuban slave doctors before Congress, where it would have failed. An agreement between only Brazil and Cuba would legally be a treaty and thus require legislative approval. An agreement with the aid of an international organization like PAHO made the terms of the agreement secret and out of reach of the voters or lawmakers.

PAHO took a payment from the Brazilian government to be involved in the deal.

The Brazilian president also made the case that his country had direct experience with the evils of Cuba’s communist regime, when mass murderer Ernesto “Che” Guevara attempted to foment revolution in South America.

“In the 1960s, Cuban agents were sent out to several countries to collaborate towards implementing dictatorships in the region. A few decades ago, they tried to change the Brazilian regime … they were defeated,” Bolsonaro said, making a vague reference to the right-wing Brazilian military regime that took over in response to communist agitation.

Bolsonaro ended his remarks warning the world that socialism and communism have “left a path of death, ignorance, and stark poverty wherever [they go].”"

Guaidó became president of Venezuela in January after Maduro’s legal presidential term expired. He holds an interim title, tasked with organizing free and fair elections, as per the Venezuelan constitution. Maduro has refused to give up his position, however, and retains control of the nation’s military, making it almost impossible for Guaidó to exercise any of his powers. The fact that Maduro refused to step down after his term ended allowed the nation’s legislature to constitutionally appoint a president to replace him.

Despite this, Guaidó’s administration has established formal diplomatic relations with over 50 countries, including most in the Western Hemisphere. The United States expelled Maduro’s envoys from the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington and have given control over to Guaidó’s ambassador, Carlos Vecchio.

“We have formed a delegation that will represent our government and all Venezuelans next week before the 74th General Assembly of the United Nations,” Guaidó announced Sunday on Twitter. “This delegation has a mandate to construct agreements with the principal leaders of the world to increase the pressure against the dictatorship and support the people of Venezuela before the grave crisis our country is facing.”

As the delegation will not legally be allowed to participate in the U.N. General Assembly, Guaidó listed the engagements that the group will partake in, including a meeting with the “Lima Group,” a Latin American coalition against Maduro; bilateral meetings with friendly states (presumably the United States among them), and “working group” meetings on specific problems facing Venezuela, including its migrant crisis and the gross human rights violations by the Maduro regime.

La delegación enviada a Naciones Unidas estará encabezada por el Comisionado para Relaciones Exteriores @JulioBorges; y participarán también el Embajador ante los EE.UU @carlosvecchio y el Comisionado para la Ayuda Humanitaria @Miguel_Pizarro, así como diputados y víctimas. — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) September 22, 2019

The United Nations has soundly rejected Guaidó’s call to put pressure on Maduro to step down and allow for the country to return to its democratic tradition. Maduro’s regime served on the U.N. Human Rights Council until completing its term this year, represented by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza. The U.N. invited Maduro to speak at this year’s General Assembly and dismissed the possibility of yielding to the international consensus that Guaidó is the nation’s president, based on the Venezuelan constitution.

Asked this month if Guaidó would be invited to the General Assembly, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres flatly rejected the idea. Guterres instead told reporters that the United Nations kept “regular contact” with Guaidó’s team, which he referred to as “the opposition,” despite being the legal executive administration of the country.

Maduro rejected Guterres’s invitation to speak at the General Assembly this year, failing to repeat on his appearance in 2018.

“I went to New York last year, this year I am not going, this year I am staying here with you working in Venezuela,” Maduro said last week, amid rumors that he fears leaving Venezuela and having his top military leaders stage a coup against him. Maduro is planning to send Arreaza and Vice President Delcy Rodríguez. Maduro ordered the two to hand to Guterres a petition allegedly signed by millions of Venezuelans – at the threat of losing their jobs, not receiving government food rations, or worse – condemning American President Donald Trump.

“The Venezuelan people say no more embargo, no more sanctions, no more aggression from the empire [America],” Maduro denounced last week.

Arreaza posted a message on Twitter Sunday vowing that, while at the United Nations, he would discuss “climate change, poverty reduction, and educational inclusivity.” In a statement on the official foreign ministry website, the Maduro regime claimed that the United States was “responsible for the largest part of the accelerated deterioration of the environment and of natural phenomena” and that Venezuela would participate in shaming Washington for this. The statement did not mention China, a longtime Maduro ally and the world’s most prolific polluter.

The Maduro regime is responsible for some of the most devastating economic damage in South America. As oil production has plummeted – a product of the Maduro and prior Hugo Chávez regimes nationalizing the industry – Maduro has had to increasingly rely on gold as a currency to continue paying for the lavish lifestyles of himself and those around him. To keep gold supplies afloat, Maduro has encouraged a sprawling illegal mining industry in the Amazon rainforest, controlled by Marxist terrorist organizations affiliated with the regime.

The Maduro regime has also had few answers to the growing garbage crisis in Caracas. Maduro’s government has failed to routinely dispose of garbage in Caracas for years, leaving feet-tall piles of trash lining the streets throughout the city. Many Venezuelans feed off the few bits of food they can find in the garbage, but the prevalence of waste lining the streets of a tropical city has created a significant medical crisis as insects and bacteria thrive, especially given the near-total lack of medicine in the country.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus described the two individuals as “abusing their privileges of residence.”

The Cuban communist regime called the move a “vulgar calumny” orchestrated by the “reactionary, anti-Cuban” Trump administration. Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs debuted a “report” attacking the United States for its trade sanctions on the regime on Friday, in anticipation for next week’s U.N. General Assembly general debate.

“The Department of State today notified the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States requires the imminent departure of two members of Cuba’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations for abusing their privileges of residence,” Ortagus said in a statement. “This is due to their attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States.”

Ortagus did not name the individuals expelled from the country, but did say that all Cuban regime operatives at the U.N. mission “will now essentially be restricted to the island of Manhattan.”

“We take any and all attempts against the National Security of the United States seriously, and will continue to investigate any additional personnel who may be manipulating their privileges of residence,” her statement concluded.

The Cuban regime has for decades abused the few diplomatic ties it is allowed in the United States for espionage and anti-American activities. In perhaps the most prominent modern example of Cuban spies threatening national security, a group of agents known as the “Cuban five” infiltrated the Cuban exile community in Miami and gave Havana intelligence that allowed the Castro regime to kill four Americans. The men – Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales – were flying legal rescue missions in international waters when Castro agents shot their planes down; the “Cuban five”‘s intelligence gave the Cuban military the information necessary to find the planes.

Despite being a gross violation of international law, the Cuban government suffered no consequences for the murders. President Barack Obama freed the “Cuban five” to a hero’s welcome in Havana in 2014. Gael García Bernal is currently starring in a film glorifying the work the spies did to kill the Americans.

The Cuban Foreign Ministry (MINREX) issued an outraged tweet in response to the expulsion.

“I categorically reject the unjustified expulsion of two officials at the Permanent Mission of Cuba at the U.N. and the hardening of restrictions of movement on diplomats and families,” Foreign Ministry Bruno Rodríguez said on Twitter. “The implication that they committed acts incompatible with their diplomatic status is a vulgar calumny.”

Rodríguez held a press conference Friday where he claimed he found out about the expulsion through a U.S. diplomatic tweet. He claimed the move triggered “absolute and energetic rejection from our people, our ministry, and our government.”

“It is totally unjustified and illegitimate to strongarm our diplomats,” he complained.

Rodríguez went on to call the Trump administration “a reactionary, anti-Cuban group that has hijacked American foreign policy on Cuba and Latin America” and accused Trump of lashing out at Cuba for “electoral interests” – implying that strengthening national security defenses would help Trump win the 2020 election.

The Permanent Mission to the U.N. representing Cuba put out its own statement denying any wrongdoing, then admitting that American officials had notified it that the two individuals in question were caught engaging in damaging acts to U.S. national security on September 12, about a week before any statements on Twitter to that effect.

“The note said that, unless Cuba lent information to justify [their behavior] otherwise, they [the U.S.] would ask for the necessary planning to occur for the departure of the two officials and their families within 48 hours, before the end of the day on September 20,” the statement read.

The mission claims to have responded with their explanation for the officials’ behavior, “but the U.S. side, in flagrant violation of the basic principles of diplomatic protocol, decided to respond in a tweet.”

The expulsions are acts of “vengeance and impotence,” the mission concluded.

The diplomatic scuffle comes on the eve of a week of debate at the U.N. General Assembly, where most of the world’s heads of state are invited to take the floor and talk about whatever they want. America grants dictators and international criminals who hold head of state status immunity to attend the event, resulting in leaders like Miguel Díaz-Canel – who is not the head of state of Cuba, but nonetheless holds the title of “president” – addressing the assembly last year to bash America for “imperialism.”

Following a speech in which President Donald Trump urged the world to reconsider socialism, Díaz-Canel contended that the world’s horrors were “the consequence of capitalism, especially imperialism and neoliberalism, of the egoism and exclusion that accompany this system, and of an economic, political, social, and cultural paradigm that privileges that accumulation of wealth in few hands at the cost of exploitation and misery of the masses.”

While in New York, Díaz-Canel enjoyed a star-studded welcome organized by Robert Do Niro and concluded the trip with a night of salsa dancing.

Correa, wanted on charges of kidnapping a political dissident and corruption involving lucrative oil deals with China and currently exiled in Belgium, is a television host on Russia Today (RT), the state propaganda network. His program Conversando con Correa (“Talking with Correa”) featured Maduro this week.

“Venezuela is not being sanctioned, it is being attacked,” said Correa. “Even if they were sanctions, on what basis are they? Under what international law?”

“For that reason, I will say something that is not an exaggeration,” Maduro responded. “Donald Trump has a kind of obsession and hatred against the Latin American people in general, against refugees, immigrants … but he has a special hatred for the people of Venezuela and all our history.”

“And Donald Trump is playing out that hatred against the people of Venezuela in a similar way to Nazi Germany, with the same vision that Hitler had against the European Jews in the 1930s before war broke out in 1939,” Maduro alleged.

Maduro a Correa: ""Yo lo comparo a Trump con la era de Hitler"" Venezuela: realidades y mitos, persecución financiera mundial, manipulación mediática, modelo rentista… son algunos de los temas que abordarán @MashiRafael y @NicolasMaduro en el programa #ConversandoConCorrea. pic.twitter.com/YtAfaibZIO — RT en Español (@ActualidadRT) September 18, 2019

Maduro then went on to mock the legitimate president of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, who has failed to wrestle power away from the socialist dictatorship and instigate a transition to democracy.

“The strategy of building a parallel government with the support of the United States and its Latin American allies from the Lima Group, it has failed, it has no chance of success,” Maduro said.

He continued:

The real power is in the hands of the European oligarchic structures, they are the closest allies of the American government. They are like blood brothers. Donald Trump has imposed his extremist policies towards Venezuela on Europe. There is a distorted image of Venezuela in the international media, and then there is the real Venezuela that you can see with your own eyes. It is nation that above all protects itself, like a family.

The Russian government is one of the few in the world to continue recognizing Maduro as the head of state of Venezuela, despite his term expiring in January. Moscow actively supports Maduro financially and militarily. As an arm of the Putin regime, RT regularly attempts to downplay the extent of Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian crisis while giving substantial coverage to individuals blaming the country’s problems on the United States.

Correa and Maduro have long been friends and allies on the basis of their shared socialist principles. As president, Correa was a strong supporter of the late dictator Hugo Chávez and counted on support from a collection of leftist leaders that rose to prominence in the region in the 2000s. Most have since lost power, ceding their leadership to more right-leaning heads of state, most notably Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Mauricio Macri in Argentina, and Sebastián Piñera in Chile.

Last year, an Ecuadorian court issued an arrest warrant for Correa over his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of the lawmaker and political opponent Fernando Balda in 2012. Criminal investigations into his political tenure began after he refused to testify on his deals with China, in which he sold vast amounts of oil to Beijing at low prices in what the Ecuadorian Prosecutor General last year described as the “greatest heist in the country’s history.” He has so far refused to abide the warrant and remains in his wife’s native Belgium, from where he is yet to face extradition.

During his decade in office, Correa himself faced criticisms for his left-wing authoritarianism, which included attempts to curtail the freedom of the press and threatening and persecuting political opponents. In 2015, he also stoked controversy by responding to accusations of fascism by tweeting “Heil Hitler!” That same year, he also attacked President Barack Obama’s views on American history, declaring it “troubling that an Afro minimizes history.”

Maduro announced new “talks” this week with individuals he claimed represent the Venezuelan opposition. The parties invited to the talks are almost entirely Marxist — some to the left of Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) — and do not represent any significant percentage of the Venezuelan population. President Juan Guaidó, legally the head of state of the country despite Maduro refusing to hand over military power, is not participating in the talks.

Guaidó is a member of the Popular Will party, an official member party of the Socialist International. Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) considers the Socialist International a right-wing institution for condemning the gross human rights abuses his regime regularly commits.

The “opposition” engaged in the talks has spread rumors that the regime may begin freeing some of the hundreds of political prisoners it is keeping as part of a deal with them. Maduro denies holding any prisoners of conscience and has arrested journalists, including Univision’s Jorge Ramos, for discussing the torture and imprisonment of political dissidents.

Maduro’s regime abruptly freed Guaidó’s second-in-command, First Vice President of the National Assembly Edgar Zambrano, on Tuesday, after four months of incarceration without being presented with any evidence he had committed a crime. Secret police agents towed Zambrano to prison in May after he refused to get out of his car but never presented him with any particular charges.

Zambrano used his freedom to immediately call for the liberation of all political prisoners, and reports began to circulate that Maduro may trade prisoners for some international goodwill.

The Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reported on Thursday that parties to the talks with Maduro — which include groups such as “Movement Towards Socialism” and the “Progressive Alliance” — were screening prisoners on Wednesday at the Helicoide, a former shopping-mall-to-be turned into a prison for political dissidents and the headquarters of the Bolivarian Intelligence Agency (SEBIN). The newspaper claimed the politicians were interviewing prisoners and met with 20 individuals who were “candidates” for release as part of a deal between the leftist parties and Maduro. As many as 60 individuals could be conditionally released under house arrest or probation, the report added.

Alfredo Romero, the director of the Venezuelan Penal Forum, warned that the information currently available does not guarantee that the individuals released, if any, will be prisoners of conscience.

Speaking on Wednesday to Venezuelan outlet Unión Radio, Romero said that Maduro’s regime “regularly includes in its group of freed suspected political prisoners some who are not [political prisoners], but common criminals.”

“These liberations are a form of extortion and intimidation,” Romero warned, suggesting that the Maduro regime would rapidly fill the empty cells, some that once held criminals, with political dissidents. “All this is just a show to benefit some factions who want to win some sort of medal.”

Maduro’s regime is heavily engaged in cocaine trafficking and allied with terrorist organizations like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Hezbollah. It also often employs violent criminals to intimidate political dissidents and attack them, forming violent gangs called colectivos.

Romero noted on a separate program on Venezuela’s NTN24 that, even in the event that the number of political prisoners discussed would be freed, they would be a minuscule number of the people being tortured in political prisons nationwide. The Venezuelan Penal Forum has certified the existence of 477 political prisoners in the country as of this week.

“If they free, let’s say, 40 people, that would represent ten percent, less than ten percent, of the 477 political prisoners still behind bars. So the first problem is that a group of political prisoners under the same unjust and political circumstances of arrest will be left forgotten, trapped,” said Romero. “And the second point is that the revolving door gets greased up — while they free people, they imprison even more of them.”

Alfredo Romero: liberar 40 presos políticos en Venezuela no representaría ni el 10% de los que están tras las rejas https://t.co/G90bql3CWL pic.twitter.com/qVxet3j1uo — NTN24 (@NTN24) September 18, 2019

Maduro has repeatedly denied the existence of political prisoners in the country. In a dramatic moment for Maduro, he arrested Ramos and his team while in Caracas in February after Ramos asked him about the prisoners. Maduro denied their existence, so Ramos handed him a list with the hundreds of names of individuals detained for opposing socialism. Ramos also showed Maduro a video of Venezuelans eating out of a garbage truck, asking him why he had implemented policies that were starving his people.

Maduro reportedly “didn’t like” the interview, confiscated it, and arrested the team. Univision acquired the lost video footage in May through contacts in the Venezuelan government that confirmed Ramos’s version of events and showed Maduro flatly denying the existence of prisoners of conscience.

“Take your little garbage and take it away, comrade,” Maduro said, swatting away the list of prisoners.

Our movement is urging Venezuela to legalize guns for law-abiding citizens and offer a set of both private and public gunnery and educational programs related to gun rights.

In the proposal issued on September 5th, written by General Coordinators Eduardo Bittar and Roderick Navarro, we presented as public initiatives the establishment of private gun ownership and the usage of firearms for law-abiding citizens as a constitutional right.

As a follow-up constitutional reform, we are proposing the revocation of “any national (federal) law that imposes restrictions on private gun-ownership for law-abiding citizens” to abrogate the absolute criminalization of gun possession.

Socialist dictator Hugo Chávez banned all private gun ownership, giving the state a full monopoly on firearms in his rewrite of the constitution. Nicolás Maduro, his successor, strengthened the ban by adding an up to 20-year prison sentence to the law for anyone caught privately owning a firearm.

Unfortunately, we have found no support for this pivotal civil and political right from the Venezuelan socialist opposition. In April, President Juan Guaidó ratified Chávez’s gun control policy, also known as Ley Desarme, implying with his argument that criminals and law-abiding citizens are equal.

Guaidó used the fact that socialist thugs disguise themselves as police to attack unarmed citizens as an argument to keep self-defense weapons out of these citizens’ hands.

“Police have denounced … they [chavistas] dress civilians as police officers, who then use security corps weapons to try to subjugate and instill fear into the citizenry,” Guaidó said.

Rumbo Libertad is proposing the creation of public shooting ranges and multidisciplinary civilian marksmanship programs through the Ministry of Domestic Affairs. These shooting ranges will include “practical civilian security firearm programs and personal defense, marksmanship, and hunting courses.”

Regarding education, we are proposing the creation and inclusion of “basic security instruction programs with firearms (just like the NRA Eddie Eagle program in the U.S.) to avoid accidents in households” for primary schools. For high schools, Rumbo Libertad proposes “a more advanced education that provides a more general comprehension about pistols, rifles, and shotguns, and their legal usage.”

For the private sector, we propose the creation of a “national gun rights organization, with state and local members, in order to organize gun owners. This organization will help to coordinate the education and training on firearms through several programs.” This sort of Venezuelan NRA will also work in favor of legislative and political initiatives that will defend gun rights from any restriction or candidate that seeks to undermine gun rights. Additionally, this organization will establish local and state divisions that will support sportive gunnery activities.

The results Rumbo Libertad is seeking with these proposals are:

The neutralization of the gun trafficking business. The reduction of crime rates through the training (with the required and necessary capacities and skills) of the citizenry for rapid reaction in case of the absence of police officers. The enforcement of civilian conscience with a higher level of responsibility. A citizenry that’s aware of its duty is a citizenry that educates young people away from criminal activity. The creation of jobs, industry growth, and tech development due to all the private sector gun business-related activities. The creation of incentives that will reinforce the national security and defense systems. This will increase security rates inside the Venezuelan territory compared to other countries, making Venezuela a much more competitive and visionary nation in the region.

We as a political movement are the first platform in Latin America to propose such a policy and political agenda, involving educational, social, state-related, and cultural initiatives. Our goal is to provide a model for other regional allies to follow and support the agenda, be it other political platforms or even organizations like the NRA in the U.S.

It is important to recall that the Second Amendment served as inspiration for this proposal – proving its validity to Venezuelans, who regret this gun ban. That is why we want to give Venezuela the necessary tools for defense and to exercise this God-given right, defending our lives, our liberty, and our sacred honor not only constitutionally, but in a way that will counter the anti-gun rights narrative that has been imposed for decades by the Left.

659,,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2019/09/18/venezuela-juan-guaidos-2-freed-after-towed-prison/,2019-09-18T00:00:00,Venezuela: Juan Guaidó’s #2 Freed After Being Towed into Prison,"The socialist dictatorship ruling Venezuela released Edgar Zambrano, first vice president of the National Assembly, from political prison late Tuesday, following talks between dictator Nicolás Maduro and various Marxist minority factions in the country.

The Maduro regime abducted Zambrano in May in retaliation for President Juan Guaidó, who as president of the National Assembly was Zambrano’s boss, announcing that he would launch a campaign to wrest control of the Venezuelan military out of Maduro’s hands. Zambrano refused to leave his car to address members of Maduro’s Secret Police (the SEBIN), so SEBIN agents towed his car into the Helicoide, the regime’s most notorious political prison.

As Maduro has not been the legitimate head of state of the country since January – and the National Assembly used its constitutional powers to make Guaidó interim president to fill the void – Guaidó is also the legitimate commander in chief of the country’s armed forces. Military leaders have remained loyal to Maduro, however, making it impossible for Guaidó to use his constitutional powers.

Maduro’s socialist tribunal announced on Tuesday that Zambrano is facing charges of “attempts against the Venezuelan State,” but that he would now await sentencing in a state of limited freedom, in which he will have to report to a court every 30 days to ensure he does not leave the country. Venezuelan state television cited Maduro’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, as saying that Zambrano’s freedom was a direct result of the alleged dialogue between the regime and the “opposition,” an assortment of Marxist groups to which Guaidó, also a member of a socialist political party, does not belong.

Zambrano spent about four months in prison despite the Maduro regime not producing any evidence tying him to criminal activity.

His dramatic arrest occurred in early April in front of the National Assembly. Zambrano was driving when SEBIN agents surrounded his car and demanded he step out. Instead, he took to Twitter, narrating the details of his apprehension.

“We alert all the people of Venezuela that at this moment, 6:35 p.m., we are surrounded by SEBIN [agents], we are in our vehicle at the headquarters of [political party] Democratic Action in la Florida [a Caracas street],” he wrote on May 8. Less than an hour later, SEBIN agents tied his car to a tow truck and hoisted him away.

“We were surprised by the SEBIN, as we refused to get out of our vehicle, they used a tow truck to transfer us forcibly to the Helicoide. We democrats will stay firm on our feet in this struggle,” he wrote on Twitter.

The Helicoide, once destined to be a luxury shopping mall, is the Maduro regime’s special facility for prisoners of conscience; it also houses SEBIN headquarters. Survivors of the Helicoide say that torture is commonplace there, including electrocution, sleep deprivation, crucifixion, and rape.

Following his release, Zambrano used his first moments in public to demand freedom for all political prisoners.

“There must be a significant effort, first of all, to secure the liberation of all political prisoners, civilian and military,” he told reporters. He described his prison time as “being caged like animals” and said that talks with the regime may soon generate the release of as many as 58 political prisoners.

According to the Venezuelan Penal Forum, an NGO dedicated to tracking prisoners of conscience in the South American country, there are currently 477 political prisoners in Venezuela and over 8,000 people under “precautionary” deprivation of liberty measures, like house arrest or probation, in the country.

Guaidó participated in negotiations with the regime for months following his rise to power in January. As any negotiation with the regime remains extremely unpopular among Venezuelans, Guaidó insisted that the talks were not “negotiations,” but “mediations,” without explaining the difference. Finding that the talks yielded nothing but time for the regime to regroup, Guaidó walked out in early July, but changed his mind by the end of the week.

Guaidó is currently not in talks with the Maduro regime. Instead, Maduro has launched a “dialogue” with the Movement Toward Socialism, Progressive Alliance, and Red Flag parties – a consortium of unpopular Marxist groups. As a result of the talks, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) – Maduro’s party – will soon reenter the National Assembly, which it walked out on and replaced with an unconstitutional “National Constituent Assembly” in 2017. Returning to the constitutional legislature may allow Maduro to unseat Guaidó from the inside, though Maduro does not currently hold any legal public office.

Members of the opposition have reacted to Zambrano’s release with caution. Journalist Ibéyise Pacheco referred to his release as a “distraction,” a “play to try to create a smokescreen” to empower Maduro. Julio Borges, a senior opposition member, rejected Maduro’s “hostage trading.”

“Nicolás Maduro is trading his dictatorship’s hostages at the convenience of his miserable project to stay in power,” Borges wrote on Twitter. “We are happy that his victim, Edgar Zambrano, is free, but we cannot lose the context of what is truly behind this.”

María Corina Machado, one of the few conservative members of the Venezuelan opposition, issued a statement saying she was “happy” Zambrano was out of prison, “but he is not free.”

“We will all only be free once we expel these mafias from power, all the truth is known, as justice is done,” she said.

Maduro also claimed that his nation, left destitute by two decades of extreme socialist economic policies, was an example to the world in offering children a dignified education and bright future.

According to UNICEF, over three million Venezuelan children are in need of dire food aid. Over four million people generally do not have access to clean drinking water and an estimated million children cannot afford to go to school due to their lack of access to food and school supplies.

“Venezuela today has one of the best education systems in Latin America and the world, let us be proud!” Maduro urged on state television Monday night. “Venezuela is the only country in the world that gives boys and girls their backpack with supplies … their uniforms, that guarantees public education to 80 percent of people, free and of high quality!”

Any inability on the part of the government to provide basic services was the product of antagonism by the United States, he claimed.

“We are here in a world war, of an economic character, with Imperialism [the United States] torturing the economic body of Venezuela,” Maduro claimed. “We move forward.”

Maduro did not specify how the United States was engaging in a “world war” by sanctioning only Venezuela for his regime’s gross human rights abuses. He also did not make the link directly between American sanctions on high-ranking Maduro officials – not the Venezuelan people – and the destitute state of the Venezuelan education system. Despite Maduro’s claims, the non-profit Save the Children explained last week:

Children’s access to education is also in great peril. Many of the millions who have left are teachers leaving behind run-down schools and emptying classrooms as less and less people can afford to send their children to school, even if it is free. When inflation is at well over 1 million percent, the cost of notebooks and uniforms becomes a ‘luxury’ to dispense with. As more and more Venezuelans move to neighbouring countries, the burden on local schools increases while the same economic hardships facing these incoming Venezuelans means the financial barriers to children going to school remain high.

Maduro moved on in his speech from education and “world war” to celebrate what he claimed was an opening “dialogue” with the “opposition” in the country. In reality, the individuals listed by Maduro’s state news service as having participated in talks with his regime are all socialist, communist, or progressive groups, all of whom have ties to Maduro.

According to VTV (state television), the participants in the “opposition” “dialogue” included the parties “Movement Towards Socialism,” “Progressive Alliance,” and “Red Flag,” a Marxist-Leninist group. No representatives of the Venezuela right, to the extent that one exists, participated in talks with Maduro.

The leftist “opposition” and Maduro signed an agreement that would allow the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), Maduro’s party, to acquire seats in the National Assembly without having been voted in, which allows the PSUV to regain power over the only democratically elected branch of government left. The current National Assembly is run by a coalition of socialist opposition parties distinct from the socialists negotiating with Maduro today that won the majority in 2015.

Maduro celebrated that the deal “opens all the doors towards dialogue for peace.”

“Today we have signed a partial agreement with the majority of the Venezuelan opposition,” Diosdado Cabello, a drug lord that Maduro has appointed to lead the PSUV, said on Monday. “We are totally in agreement with to reintegrate into the National Assembly … we will speak to the opposition as many times as necessary.”

Maduro has largely ignored the National Assembly since he lost it in 2015, when Cabello was speaker of the assembly. Cabello went on to establish an illegal extra-governmental legislature, the “National Constituent Assembly,” to usurp power away from the rightfully elected lawmakers in the real legislature.

Notably absent from talks with Maduro was the legal president of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Guaidó, a member of the democratic socialist Popular Will party, became president of the country in January after the National Assembly exercised its constitutional power to remove Maduro. Guaidó has failed to consolidate any military power, however, leaving him only with the nominal title of head of state.

Guaidó entered talks with the regime, inexplicably brokered by the government of Norway, this year. The talks yielded no positive movement forward, as Maduro has refused to step down.

Following the Maduro announcement this week that he had agreed to talks with the Marxist-Leninist “opposition” instead of Guaidó, the president reiterated that he was open to talks, but only with “presidential elections as soon as possible with a new electoral council (CNE), without political prisoners, with … guarantees for all who participate in the process.”

Talks with the violently repressive Maduro regime are extremely unpopular among most Venezuelans. In the latest national poll by the data firm Meganálisis, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they opposed talks between Maduro and the opposition. A similar number (89.5 percent) said they supported “foreign military operations” on Venezuelan soil to oust Maduro.

A data breach involving a large amount of sensitive personally identifiable information on an unsecured network in Miami, Florida, may affect over 20 million people located in Ecuador, according to a research team at vpnMentor.

In an effort to provide some additional context regarding the scale of the leak, vpnMentor adds that the population of Ecuador is only 16 million people.

According to the report, the server in question appears to be owned by the Ecuadorian data analytics consulting company, Novaestrat, and the leaked database seems to contain information obtained from outside sources, which may include Ecuadorian government registries, an automotive association called Aeade, and an Ecuadorian national bank called Biess.

The researchers say they were able to identify individuals in the database by a ten-digit ID code, and in some cases, the code was called “cedula” and “cedula_ruc,” which in Ecuador, refers to a person’s national identification number, similar to a social security number in the United States.

The term “RUC” refers to Ecuador’s unique taxpayer registry, meaning that a person’s taxpayer identification number may also be included in the data breach.

Among the personal information discovered, vpnMentor says they were able to find the full name, gender, date of birth, place of birth, home address, email address, home, work, and cell phone numbers, marital status, date of marriage, date of death, and level of education of the identified individuals.

The researchers also say they discovered financial information regarding accounts held with the Ecuadorian national bank Biess, such as account status, current account balance, amount financed, credit type, as well as employer name, employer location, employer tax ID number, job title, salary information, job start date, and job end date.

But what vpnMentor said was most concerning of this particular data breach, was how their team was able to find detailed information about people’s family members, such as the full name of each person’s mother, father, and spouse, as well as each family member’s “cedula.”

In addition to personal information, the data breach revealed details regarding companies in Ecuador, as well as each company’s legal representative and their contact information.

The report added that leaked email addresses and phone numbers, combined with the breach of personal information, can make way for hackers to conduct more successful scams and phishing attacks, as the attack could be tailored to each person’s personal profile, making it more likely that they will click on the links.

“This data breach is particularly serious simply because of how much information was revealed about each individual,” affirms the report. “Scammers could use this information to establish trust and trick individuals into exposing more information.”

The researchers noted that a scammer, for example, could pretend to be a friend of a family member in need of financial help, and could back up their story and build trust using the personal information they obtained in the data breach.

“Most concerning, the leaked data seems to include national identification numbers and unique taxpayer numbers,” said the researchers. “This puts people at risk of identity theft and financial fraud.”

The vpnMentor research team describes itself as “ethical hackers” who search for vulnerabilities in a system indicating an open database. The report maintains that ethical hackers “never sell, store, or expose” the information they find. “Our goal is to improve the overall safety and security of the internet for everyone,” says vpnMentor.

“Once a data breach is found, our team links the database back to the owner,” the report adds. “We then contact the owner, inform them of the vulnerability, and suggest ways that the owner can make their system more secure.”

According to vpnMentor, the Ecuadorian data breach was closed on September 11, 2019.

In their eight-page text, the prelates call on the faithful to “implore God that error and heresy do not pervert the coming special assembly of the synod of bishops for the pan-Amazon.”

The Amazon Synod’s working document is rife with “serious theological errors and heresies,” they declare, of which they enumerate six, beginning with an “implicit pantheism,” or the belief that God is not separate and distinct from his creation.

These two bishops are not alone in their concern about the theologically problematic text. Two other prominent cardinals, Walter Brandmüller, president emeritus of the Pontifical Committee for Historical Sciences, and Gerhard Müller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, have also weighed in on the document this summer.

In mid-July, Cardinal Müller issued his own lengthy critique of the synod’s working document, lamenting its “upside-down hermeneutics” and appeals to a “cosmovision with its myths and the ritual magic of Mother ‘Nature.’”

Cardinal Brandmüller went further still, declaring in late June that the Amazon Synod is “heretical” and must be “rejected.”

The synod’s preparatory document opens “a grave breach with the depositum fidei,” turning the Catholic Church into “a secular NGO with an ecological-social-psychological mandate,” the cardinal wrote.

In their new text, Cardinal Burke, patron of the Sovereign Order of Malta, and Bishop Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakhstan, further develop these ongoing concerns, warning that the synodal document suggests that “the pagan superstitions of the Amazon tribes are an expression of divine Revelation deserving an attitude of dialogue and acceptance on the part of the Church.”

They also express concern about a campaign within the Church that would lead to “the abolition of priestly celibacy in the Latin Church by introducing the praxis of the ordination of married men, the so-called ‘viri probati.’”

The numerous errors contained in the synod text are an “alarming manifestation of the confusion, error and division which beset the Church in our day,” they declare.

In calling on the faithful to embark on a 40-day prayer crusade, the prelates invite them to include in their intentions that Pope Francis may “confirm his brethren in the faith by an unambiguous rejection of the errors” in the text.

They propose that clergy and lay faithful “pray daily at least one decade of the Holy Rosary and to fast once a week” for these intentions from September 17 to October 26.

Invites Maduro to General Assembly; Maduro Declines,"Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro announced on Thursday that he had no intention of attending the United Nations General Assembly floor debate next week, to which he is invited despite not being the legal head of state of the country.

Maduro ceased being president of Venezuela after his “inauguration” in January. As his victory in the May 2018 presidential election was the product of widespread fraud and censorship of non-socialist or communist candidates, the country’s legislature, the National Assembly, used its constitutional powers to remove him.

The current president of Venezuela is Juan Guaidó, whom the United Nations did not invite to address the General Assembly despite his legal status. Despite pressure from the United States and other international actors to respect the Venezuelan constitution, the United Nations has failed to remove Maduro’s envoys from its venue.

Despite the invite, Maduro told viewers on state television Thursday that he could not visit New York next week because he had too much work to do at home.

“I went to New York last year, this year I am not going, this year I am staying here with you working in Venezuela,” he said, “very secure and very relaxed.”

Maduro is sending the nation’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, and his foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, who will reportedly bring a petition signed by socialists condemning U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Delcy and the foreign minister have high-impact voices well-known in the world,” Maduro said.

He did not specify on what work, exactly, he was staying home to do.

“I have a lot of work for the nation, to defend peace in Venezuela, to keep pushing this recovery, growth, and social prosperity plan forward,” Maduro claimed.

The Argentine outlet Infobae reported, citing anonymous sources, that the real reason Maduro felt it imperative to stay in Caracas was his fear that his highest-ranking officials would stage a coup against him. In particular, Maduro reportedly has lost trust in Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, who he believes, Infobae claimed, would launch a coup d’etat if Maduro leaves the country for more than 48 hours.

At the United Nations, Arreaza and Rodríguez, two of Maduro’s most loyal soldiers, have been tasked with handing to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 13 million signatures that Maduro, with the help of the communist regime in Cuba, allegedly collected to condemn President Trump.

“The Venezuelan people say no more embargo, no more sanctions, no more aggression from the empire [America],” Maduro said on Thursday, ordering his henchmen to go “door-to-door” and harass Venezuelans to sign his petition.

Arreaza already appeared at the United Nations Human Rights Council this week, claiming that sanctions on individual Maduro officials for participating in human rights abuses are, in themselves, human rights abuses.

“The goal is crystal clear — to bring the Venezuelan economy to its knees and to prevent the Government from meeting the basic needs of its people as well as to bring about a change of government by unconstitutional means through the use of force,” Arreaza said. “There have been attempts to use humanitarian aid as a weapon against Venezuelan sovereignty.”

Arreaza also argued that allies of the United States should not be allowed to serve on the Human Rights Council. The United States itself withdrew from the council under the Trump administration in protest of its constant condemnation of Israel and lack of action against actual human rights violators.

Arreaza contended:

If members of this Human Rights Council can be accomplices to the imposition of this kind of measure [sanctions] then they shouldn’t be members of this council. We need to look here in this council again at the criteria for the election of members of this council, and when we use those criteria we should take into account the attitude of the member state concerned towards the imposition of unilateral coercive measures.

The Trump administration has questioned why Maduro’s envoys are allowed to participate in United Nations affairs since he does not represent any legitimate government.

“With all due respect, Mr. Ambassador, you shouldn’t be here,” Vice President Mike Pence told Maduro’s ambassador to the U.N., Samuel Moncada, in April. “You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicolas Maduro that his time is up. It’s time for him to go.”

“This body should revoke the credentials of Venezuela’s representative to the United Nations, recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó, and seat the representative of the free Venezuelan government in this body without delay,” Pence continued.

Maduro did give a speech at least year’s General Assembly, declaring that “today, Venezuela is stronger than ever.” Failing to mention widespread food and medical shortages, overwhelming violence largely committed by allies of the region, and the use of torture and murder to silence dissidents, Maduro instead accused Washington of funding a “terrorist attack” against him and urged the world to “resist” America.

Maduro did not attend the 2017 General Assembly; Arreaza told reporters he was “very busy.”

Gente de Zona, whose music blends the urban reggaetón genre with traditional salsa and other Latin dance music, has sold millions of records and launched a booming music career from their native Havana, which violently represses musicians who do not bend their knees to the communist regime. They regularly perform in the United States, including on televised awards shows, then return to Cuba with the money they made in America. The current uproar against the group in the Cuban-American community is in part a response to the Castro regime giving them a stage to perform in front of hundreds of thousands of people last week.

Under the hashtag #nogreencardgdz, Cubans and Cuban Americans are taking to Twitter to pressure Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and local politicians to review how group members Alexander Delgado and Randy Malcom are legally allowed to live and work in the country. Multiple petitions have also surfaced on Change.org asking the U.S. government to block the band from entering the country.

“Gente De Zona works on behalf of the dictatorship in Cuba and serves their interest. This is a request to open an investigation to possibly have their permanent resident card removed due to their link to the Cuban Government,” one of the petitions reads.

The campaign has snowballed since being launched by Cuban cultural commentator Alexander Otaola, who broadcasts a nightly YouTube program on culture and politics. Otaola has taken to routinely exposing Cuban artists and celebrities for their silence in the face of extreme human rights abuses on the island and demanding they use their platforms, like he does, to elevate the voices of persecuted dissidents.

Otaola noted that Gente de Zona’s concert last weekend in Havana, which attracted an estimated 350,000 people, was particularly offensive in light of violent attacks on dissidents organized to prevent a planned protest Sunday in honor of Cuba’s patron saint, Our Lady of Charity (La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre).

Cuban state police arrested over 100 pro-democracy protesters between Friday and Sunday, severely beating many members of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), the island’s largest dissident group. Alleged police officers, many plain-clothed, raided the homes of dissidents while beating them to steal their milk, cooking oil, and other basic needs that Cuba is suffering from extreme shortages of due to government mismanagement.

“This was their way of giving Cuba the bread and circuses it is used to,” Otaola said of the Gente de Zona concert, noting that the group had on repeated occasions lent its support to the Castro regime. “You cant live in Miami, you can’t enjoy in Miami all the freedoms and privileges the Cuban people do not enjoy, or have, or dream of having, because people like you support your repressors … and not have consequences.”

Otaola noted that Gente de Zona had just been announced as a guest to an upcoming music festival hosted by iHeartRadio and that he was “speaking to senators’ offices, to various politicians… so that they at least investigate the issue of residency for this group.” He added that, should a probe find that the group “lied to obtain benefits from our immigration system,” the Cuban-American community must demand their deportation and cancellation of their green cards.

María Elvira Salazar, a Cuban-American television host and 2018 candidate for Congress who has since announced she will run again, joined Otaola’s call (Otaola named her personally, asking if she would join the campaign).

“One cannot be with the exile community and the regime at the same time. In other words, with God and with the devil,” Salazar wrote on Facebook and Twitter. “With full conviction, I join the campaign to retire permanent residence to the duo Gente de Zona.”

1/2:No se puede estar con el exilio y el régimen a la misma vez. En otras palabras, con Dios y con el Diablo. Con plena convicción, me uno a la campaña para que le retiren la residencia permanente al dúo Gente de Zona.#nogreencardgdz pic.twitter.com/RexnglZaNE — Maria Elvira Salazar 🇺🇸 (@MaElviraSalazar) September 11, 2019

The band’s members have not yet responded to the campaign, nor has the Cuban communist regime, though the regime’s routine violations of Twitter rules resulted in it being silenced on the platform for 24 hours this week.

Gente de Zona first began infuriating the Cuban-American community in the aftermath of the death of Fidel Castro, when, during a concert, member Alexander Delgado said, “As artists and spokesmen for Cuban music, some are happy and others are sad, but, well, it is truly a loss.” Less than a year later, the band shared a moment dancing with Raúl Guillermo Rodríguez Castro, dictator Raúl’s grandson, on stage, resulting in them losing the key to the city of Miami.

In July, the city of Hialeah, Florida – a bright red conservative stronghold largely populated by working-class Cuban exiles – disinvited a former member of Gente de Zona, Jacob Forever, from a July 4 celebration due to his friendly ties to the Castro regime.

The campaign against Gente de Zona comes off the tail of a heated radio interview by the Pichy Boys, a morning zoo radio duo, of Cuban reggaetón artist Lenier Mesa in August. Mesa walked out of the studio after the interviews, Alexander González and Maikel Rodríguez, asked him about the widespread repression in communist Cuba.

González and Rodríguez have also challenged fellow radio host Enrique Santos, who announced Gente de Zona’s upcoming iHeartRadio gig, to similarly confront the duo about human rights abuses by the Castro regime. González lamented in his open remarks to Santos that he has tried to reach out, but “they don’t answer the phone when I call” since the duo has become more vocally anti-communist. Gente de Zona did record a promo for the Pichy Boys years ago, but appear not to have had contact with them publicly for some time, overlapping with the growing calls for freedom the radio team has made in the past year.

Gente de Zona have won Latin Grammys, Latin American Music Awards, and several Spanish-language awards for their music, particularly their 2016 breakout Album Visualízate. The album single “La Gozadera” received three Platinum certifications in Spain.

The suspension blocked content from the official accounts of Raúl Castro, the Cuban Communist Party, and its state newspaper Granma, as well as up to 20 others.

A Twitter spokesman told media that the accounts had violated Twitter rules by attempting to artificially amplify the reach of their propaganda to make the Communist Party seem more popular. Cuba has been caught in the past creating fake Twitter accounts using celebrity photos that attempt to pass as regular Cuban people praising their repressive government.

Twitter restored the accounts late Thursday. The many unaffected Cuban regime accounts active used the blackout time to condemn the United States and Twitter for applying the terms of use of the website to them. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez published a post calling America “genocidal” four times, in both English and Spanish.

Cuba’s Foreign Ministry (MINREX) highlighted four of the affected accounts on the site: the Granma page, communist radio network Radio Rebelde’s official page, the state website CubaDebate, and the account for the state television show Mesa Redonda (“Round Table”), where Castro had dispatched the nation’s second-in-command, Miguel Díaz-Canel, to address growing unrest in response to severe electricity and gasoline shortages in the country.

“In an obvious concerted operation, there was an attempt to limit the revolutionaries’ states in favor of the truth,” MINREX dramatically proclaimed.

Durante la intervención de @DiazCanelB en la Mesa Redonda, #Twitter suspendió las cuentas de los principales medios y operadores de información de #Cuba. En una evidente operación concertada se trató de limitar los pronunciamientos de los revolucionarios en favor de la verdad. pic.twitter.com/N1Dm8wtytW — Cancillería de Cuba (@CubaMINREX) September 12, 2019

The regime denounced the application of the terms of use, which Twitter offers to read to anyone opening an account on the site, as “cyber warfare.”

Reuters, which reached out to Twitter for an explanation, noted that Castro’s page, as well as that of his daughter and state official Mariela Castro, were also affected.

“Asked to comment on the suspensions, a Twitter spokesman said that the company’s platform manipulation policies prohibit users artificially amplifying or disrupting conversations by using multiple accounts,” Reuters reported. Twitter made clear that it had reached out individually to the affected accounts to explain their violations.

“You may not use Twitter’s services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter,” the site’s terms of use read. “You can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.”

In an article on Thursday announcing their return to the platform, Granma claimed that Twitter suspended the accounts “for no reason.” The same article goes on to confirm that Twitter officials did, in fact, tell the owners of the affected accounts that they had violated the rules by “using various identical accounts with similar content to artificially amplify conversations.

It confirmed that Twitter suspended “around 20 accounts owned by important Cuban media, press directives, government officials, and journalists.”

Cuba bans all independent journalism. It has, in recent years, allowed the publication 14 y medio to function online, though the outlet relies heavily on Cubans in exile for much of its material.

Granma complained that the blackout appeared to be timed with a Mesa Redonda broadcast in which Díaz-Canel attempted to blame the United States for the many fuel and energy shortages in the country – which are a direct result of socialist mismanagement of Venezuela, the country that provided free oil to Cuba for decades before running out.

“The Cuban president [under Raúl Castro] explained how the current American administration is increasing hostilities towards Cuba with the aim of harming the basic needs of the people and their daily activities,” Díaz-Canel reportedly said on the broadcast.

Foreign Ministry Rodríguez made similar claims on Twitter with his, one of the few accounts unaffected, calling Washington “genocidal.”

The #US government genocidal plan against #Cuba will fail. Guided by the same intentions that inspired the infamous Lester Mallory Memorandum in 1960, it seeks to harm the everyday life of Cuban families to get political concessions.

In reality, the shortages are the product of Cuban regime abuse of its economy and incompetence at running basic industries. The Cuban government admitted as much regarding a widespread bread shortage at the end of last year, telling its people that it had grossly miscalculated how much flour to import to feed its people by 40,000 tons and could not fix the broken mills of eastern Cuba due to a shortage of parts.

Twitter was forced to permanently suspend dozens of accounts linked to the Cuban regime last year due to similar terms of use violations, in that occasion violating the provision that reads:

You can’t mislead others on Twitter by operating fake accounts. This includes using misleading account information to engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior. Some of the factors that we take into consideration include:

use of stock or stolen profile photos, particularly those depicting other people;

use of stolen or copied profile bios; and

use of intentionally misleading profile information, including profile location.

The Cuban regime reportedly opened accounts using photos of Italian dancer Robert Bolle, French model Arnaud Francois, Colombian actress Paola Rey, American actress Hayden Panetierre, Canadian fitness model Amanda Lee, Greek singer Sakis Rouvas, and Argentine actor Pablo Heredia, among others, to create the appearance that young Cubans supported the regime oppressing them. The stock photos were paired with traditionally Spanish names and the accounts posted content such as meme images with Fidel Castro quotes and attacks on the United States.

Directorio Democrático Cubano, the U.S.-based Cuban exile group that exposed the spam accounts, said there were “hundreds” in existence on the site promoting communist content, and all were engaging with each other’s content.

Sanders was responding to a question from moderator Jorge Ramos, a vocal opponent of the Venezuelan regime who Maduro temporarily imprisoned after disliking his questions during an interview for Univisión in February. Ramos questioned why Sanders had failed to condemn Maduro in the past and asked him to clarify in what way his embrace of socialism as a label for his personal ideology differed from the socialism that has brought Venezuelan society to a complete collapse.

“Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant,” Sanders responded. “What we need is interntional and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela.”

“To equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair,” Sanders protested. Instead, he claimed that the socialism he supported was “what goes on in Canada and Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right.”

Under Maduro, Venezuela’s constitution refers to healthcare as a “fundamental social right, an obligation of the state [to provide], as part of the right to life.” Late dictator Hugo Chávez nationalized all hospitals in 2013, the year he died and Maduro took over. Since then, Venezuelan hospitals have suffered enormous shortages in medicine and key medical equipment. As many as 85 percent of pharmacies in Venezuela have no medicine and the country faces chronic shortages of nearly every medicine on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) list of drugs necessary to run a functional healthcare system.

Maduro has repeatedly blocked humanitarian aid shipments from entering the country.

In February, the same month Maduro arrested Jorge Ramos for asking about the status of political prisoners under his regime, Sanders told CNN that Venezuela still enjoyed “democratic operations,” refusing to call Maduro a dictator.

“I think it’s fair to say that the last election was undemocratic, but there are still democratic operations taking place in that country,” Sanders said during a town hall discussion.

Carmen Yulín Cruz, a Sanders campaign co-chair and mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, refused to condemn the human rights situation in Venezuela during an interview with Jorge Ramos in July. She also attempted to distance Sanders from the “socialist” moniker, saying she did not use it herself because, “especially for Latinos,” socialism is often equated to “authoritarianism.”

While Sanders called Maduro a “tyrant” on Thursday, Maduro has had kind words for Sanders. In 2016, Maduro condemned the United States as a dictatorship, claiming that the fact that “our revolutionary friend” Sanders did not win the Democratic primary that year was proof that “in the United States, the people do not have social rights.”

While some mainstream media outlets attempted to interpret Trump’s statements as a sign Bolton was seeking war in the South American country, all of Bolton’s public advocacy on the subject appeared to indicate otherwise. Bolton publicly trusted Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó, a “democratic” socialist, and accepted Guaidó’s strategy of offering dictator Nicolás Maduro and his henchmen amnesty despite years of ordering and committing crimes against humanity. He trusted Guaidó to negotiate with high-ranking military leaders and successfully get them to defect.

Guaidó failed spectacularly, and Bolton is now paying the price.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said he had “a very good relationship” with Bolton, but that he had made “big mistakes.”

“I disagreed with John Bolton on his attitudes on Venezuela. I thought he was way out of line and I think I’ve proven to be right,” the president said. He did not elaborate on where he was “out of line.”

McClatchy took Trump’s comments to mean that Bolton had been advocating for military action against Maduro, citing the usual shadowy cabal of “current and former administration officials.”

“One senior administration official said Trump had grown weary of repeated vows from Bolton that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro would be out of office in short order,” the outlet reported. “A second official said that they had clashed over Bolton’s efforts to advance planning for military intervention.”

The idea that Bolton was actively promoting a military attack on Caracas is wildly divergent from what Bolton was actually saying in his many public statements about the tragic situation in Venezuela. Save for one bizarre incident in which reporters gawked at a handwritten note Bolton was seen holding in January that read “5,000 troops to Colombia,” Bolton publicly urged Maduro to step aside and offered guarantees that he would be allowed to enjoy his life after bringing South America’s wealthiest nation to a state of total destitution.

The only person saying Bolton was urging Trump to kill Maduro was Maduro himself.

“Now, a year ago, it will be a year in August, there was the attempt. I can tell you that today I have proof that the assassination attempt was ordered by John Bolton in the White House,” Maduro alleged in August, making an accusation uncannily similar to one he once made against former Vice President Joe Biden. “And he waited for the results in the White House. If you dig deeper, you’ll see it someday. The proof will come out how John Bolton, in coordination with then Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. And they gave the task to Julio Borges, a former legislator in Venezuela.”

Back in reality, Bolton used heavy-handed language to condemn Maduro and his criminal officials but made their exit his paramount interest, not justice for their victims.

“Under this administration, we will no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores in this Hemisphere. We will not reward firing squads, torturers, and murderers. We will champion the independence and liberty of our neighbors,” Bolton said in a speech in Miami, Florida, in November, announcing sanctions against the Venezuelan regime and warning its allies in Nicaragua and Cuba that they were next.

Bolton’s tune changed in January, when Juan Guaidó became president of Venezuela.

Venezuela’s constitution – the one put into place by its original socialist dictator, Hugo Chávez – allows the National Assembly to replace a president if he “disrupts the constitutional order” by refusing to step down when his term is over. After Maduro’s “inauguration” in January, following a blatantly fraudulent election in May 2018, the legislature did just that, inaugurating Guaidó, its president, as the chief executive of the country. He remains to this day the only legal head of state in Venezuela.

Shortly after Guaidó’s ascent, Bolton began urging Maduro to step down with the promise that he would face no human rights tribunal for the many atrocities he has committed during his rule.

“I wish Nicolás Maduro and his top advisors a long, quiet retirement,” Bolton said on Twitter.

I wish Nicolas Maduro and his top advisors a long, quiet retirement, living on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela. They should take advantage of President Guaido’s amnesty and move on. The sooner the better. — John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) January 31, 2019

Bolton’s change of strategy – from “we will no longer appease dictators” to “living on a nice beach somewhere” – was clearly meant as a gesture of trust in Guaidó. The Venezuelan president took little to no time to begin offering Maduro legal amnesty upon taking office.

“[Maduro] is an official, a public official, a dictator responsible for the victims yesterday in Venezuela,” Guaidó said following his inauguration. “There is a very clear responsibility on this. [Yet] in transition periods, similar things have happened,” he said of amnesty.

Amnesty “is on the table for all who are willing to be on the right side of the constitution, to restore the constitutional order.”

Four months later, Guaidó dramatically declared that his offers to high-ranking Maduro officials of amnesty in exchange for abandoning Maduro had been accepted and that he was willing to trust some of the world’s most dangerous criminals when they said they were now on his side.

Standing next to Leopoldo López – Venezuela’s most famous political prisoner – Guaidó announced in the early morning hours of May 1 that “the people of Venezuela have initiated the end of the usurpation.”

“People of Venezuela, it is necessary that we go out to the street today, to back democratic forces and recover our freedom,” Guaidó declared. “Organized and together, move to the [country’s] main military units. People of Caracas, come to La Carlota [Airbase in Caracas].”

López, the head of Guaidó’s socialist Popular Will Party, said that soldiers had freed him from his house arrest and that the party had convinced a critical mass of soldiers and senior regime officials to turn on Maduro.

Bolton lent support to Guaidó’s movement, saying in an interview the following day that Maduro “and his regime were down in a bunker somewhere” while this was happening” because they had lost confidence in their senior officials and could rely only on elite Cuban forces to stay in power. He later claimed that three senior Maduro loyalists, including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, had told him that they agreed with ousting Maduro.

Padrino openly mocked the plan.

“It makes one very indignant … that they would come over to buy me with a treacherous, stupid, ridiculous offer, with these offers they are making with their mouths only because they have nothing in their chests, in their hearts,” Padrino said on state television, pledging his loyalty to Maduro.

Maduro himself, meanwhile, was dancing on television, enabling his senior thugs – like United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) chief and drug kingpin Diosdado Cabello – to enact an internal purge of suspected traitors.

“All he needs is a little push” to leave power, Guaidó said of Maduro following his takeover declaration. He has been repeating the same claim ever since, shamefully agreeing to “negotiations” with a regime he insists is barely holding on to power.

The negotiations fly in the face of the overwhelming majority opinion among Venezuelans. Polls taken shortly after the May 1 “coup” found that 90 percent of Venezuelans believed Guaidó should authorize a foreign military to take out Maduro. Another 91 percent said they did not believe removing Maduro without military action was possible. Opposition activists in the country expressed outrage at the idea that Maduro may receive amnesty for the torture, rape, and murder of hundreds of political dissidents.

Bolton made no public acknowledgment of the majority opinion of the Venezuelan people, letting Guaidó lead his policy instead.

He also never raised concerns publicly about Guaidó’s plans for Venezuela after Maduro, detailed in a sprawling policy paper called the “Plan País” (“Country Plan”). Guaidó, whose Popular Will Party is a member of the Socialist International, has planned for massive government investment in the nation’s economy, keeping private enterprise out of its oil industry, imposing a universal healthcare plan, and creating new social programs to address famine, crime, and other problems created by socialism through more socialism.

Bolton called for more aid to Guaidó as recently as this week.

Venezuela will always be Bolton’s most overwhelming policy failure because he failed to be the John Bolton that liberals have warned us for decades that he is. When President Trump needed a voice advising against conciliatory gestures and alliances with socialists the most – when he needed someone willing to risk his reputation to echo the 90 percent of Venezuelans who want military intervention – he held Guaidó’s hand and offered Maduro a “beach somewhere.” The media’s revisionist interpretation of Trump’s comments to make Bolton look like too much of a warmonger, and not enough of one, cannot mask this reality.

**UPDATE** Donald Trump tweeted Thursday that John Bolton was “holding me back” regarding Venezuela:

In fact, my views on Venezuela, and especially Cuba, were far stronger than those of John Bolton. He was holding me back! https://t.co/FUGc02xiac — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019

668,,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/09/12/bolsonaros-foreign-minister-no-adversarial-relationship-between-brazil-china/,2019-09-12T00:00:00,"Foreign Minister: 'No Adversarial Relationship' Between Brazil, China","WASHINGTON, DC — Foreign Minister of Brazil Ernesto Araujo claimed on Wednesday his country has “benefitted a lot from trade with China,” apparently diverging from conservative President Jair Bolsonaro’s warnings against business with the communist regime as a presidential candidate last year.

During an event sponsored by the conservative Heritage Foundation, Amb. Ernesto Araujo acknowledged that “Brazil has benefitted a lot from trade with China,” adding:

We do have the feeling that in the past, Brazil didn’t negotiate well with China, we didn’t use well our cards well and again [that is] no fault of China. It’s the fault of our negotiators. … I don’t see, at all, any sort of adversarial relationship with China. I think it’s also a cooperative relationship that can come with mutual benefits.

Bolsonaro, who reportedly invited the Chinese communist regime to send an envoy to his inauguration on January 1 after calling for a global coalition against communism, is expected to visit Beijing later this year.

As a presidential candidate, the Brazilian leader warned against Chinese investment. Echoing the rhetoric and policies of President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro repeatedly cautioned about Beijing’s growing influence on his country.

Respectively, China and its rival the United States are Brazil’s top two trading partners. Both China and the United States have boasted about their relationship with the Bolsonaro government in Brazil.

The South American country is the second-largest democracy and economy in the Americas after the United States.

Araujo conceded that Brazil’s economy had taken a hit, blaming “China’s competitiveness.”

He added:

We’re trying to also address those imbalances … Our coming visit to China is part is part of our efforts to address that — to have more access to Chinese markets and sectors [where we are not present].

He contended that Beijing benefited most than any other country from globalization, and that has created some “imbalances” between China and the United States.

“It’s not, I think, China’s fault, but it’s a problem for some people, I guess, in the U.S.,” he continued, referring to the trade war between the two countries.

In June, the White House said the American President Donald Trump and Bolsonaro discussed the threat China poses to the Western Hemisphere during the G20 summit. However, China gloated soon after Bolsonaro took office that the South American president is determined to improve Brazil’s ties with Beijing.

The U.S. military has repeatedly warned against Beijing’s growing presence and influence in Latin America. According to the U.S. military, China is rapidly expanding its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the Western Hemisphere. BRI is a massive infrastructure and digital network project that is expected to link China to the rest of the world. U.S. officials have warned that China is using BRI as a predatory lending vehicle used to undermine borrowing countries’sovereignty by burying them in unsustainable loans.

China often requires natural resources and other strategic assets as collateral for the loans.

In February, U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) — charged with overseeing most of Latin America and the Caribbean — warned:

China has accelerated expansion of its Belt and Road Initiative [in the region] at a pace that may one day overshadow its expansion in Southeast Asia and Africa. … China utilizes the same predatory, non-transparent foreign lending practices it has implemented around the world to exert political and economic leverage in certain countries. China has pledged at least $150 billion in loans to countries in the hemisphere, and 16 nations now participate in the Belt and Road Initiative.

Brazil has reportedly signed on to BRI, which the United States considers a threat.

Before Bolsonaro’s election, some observers acknowledged that South American leader would have to enhance its relationship with China to revive Brazil’s economy."

Fires have been raging in the rainforest for the past month in Brazil and Bolivia. Socialist Bolivian President Evo Morales loosened restrictions on manmade clearing fires to boost agriculture in his country, while Bolsonaro responded to the fires by recently banning slash and burn practices. In his televised diatribe, Maduro did not mention Bolivia or Morales, instead pillorying the “fascist” Bolsonaro.

“[Bolsonaro] has authorized the indiscriminate burning of the Amazon to hand it over to landowners, to the landholding oligarchy in Brazil and has destroyed the Amazon,” Maduro alleged.

“He has destroyed the Amazon, which is the whole world’s lung … the destruction in Brazil is impressive, truly painful, it makes you want to cry when you look on, impotently, at how the neo-liberal fascist right from within Brazil destroys our sister nation,” Maduro continued.

Maduro then offered unspecified aid to help with the fires, though his socialist policies have collapsed the Venezuelan economy and left what was once the wealthiest nation in the region destitute.

Venezuela’s illegitimate socialist regime – replaced constitutionally in January by President Juan Guaidó but still in power through brute force – was not invited to attend a meeting last week of Amazonian nations to discuss how to curtail the fires, which have expanded much further than they did a year ago but have not reached the peak levels seen in the beginning of the century. Morales condemned the move, insisting the Bolivarian socialists should attend because Venezuela possesses a significant chunk of the Amazon Rainforest and should have a say. Morales did not mention the possibility of inviting Guaidó to send a representative to the meeting.

“Above all our ideological differences are the interests of Mother Earth,” Morales said.

Venezuela is not in the scope of the current fires, but Maduro has allowed other environmental disasters to develop in his country. Illegal gold mining, for example, has greatly increased since Maduro passed a law in 2016 that expanded government corporations’ and foreign entities’ ability to mine for gold in the country. The Spanish newspaper El País reported last week that as many as 85 percent of the areas in which illegal mining is occurring in the entirety of the Amazon Rainforest are located within Venezuela. Only about six percent of the rainforest is located within Venezuela; over half of it is in Brazil.

Colombia and Bolivia attended the recent meeting on handling the fires, but President Bolsonaro was unable to do so due to a scheduled surgery to continue the extensive repair necessary for his digestive system following an assassination attempted a year ago. A self-described socialist stabbed Bolsonaro in public during a presidential campaign rally, causing major damage to his intestinal tract. The scheduled surgery was his fourth since the stabbing.

Bolsonaro has responded to the fires by banning farmers from burning down forest areas to plant crops, a common practice this time of year as it is the Southern Hemisphere’s spring. He has inspired the ire of the left, however, for noting that the current scope of the fires is still under the peaks of the early 2000s.

Experts cite satellite evidence to note that the fires are at their highest levels since 2010.

In neighboring Bolivia, Morales is also struggling to limit the fires, particularly given that he enacted executive policies to facilitate the use of fires to clear land for planting crops. Bolivia has lost an area nearly the size of New Jersey to the fires, according to Reuters, in the past month. Bolivian officials have also documented an increase in the number of fire epicenters within their borders; according to a BBC report published Wednesday, the number of fire centers skyrocketed between the past two days from 800 fires to over 3,000.

670,,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2019/09/11/colombia-may-brand-cuba-state-sponsor-terrorism-aiding-marxists/,2019-09-11T00:00:00,Colombia May Brand Cuba a State Sponsor of Terrorism,"The government of Colombia threatened to campaign for the United Nations to brand Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism if it did not hand over the leaders of the Marxist National Liberation Army (ELN) terrorist group, a letter published by Colombian media revealed on Tuesday.

The text of the letter, reproduced by the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo, cites the recent call to arms by another communist terrorist organization, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as the impetus for the demand to extradite Nicolás Rodríguez Bautista, alias “Gabino,” and Israel Ramírez Pineda, alias “Pablo Beltrán” – the leaders of the ELN currently taking refuge in Cuba.

“Jesús Santrich” and “Iván Márquez,” two senior leaders of the FARC, announced a truce with the ELN to cooperate in their war on the “oligarchy,” as they refer to the Colombian government. Santrich, a senator in the country’s most powerful legislative chamber as part of a 2016 peace deal, and Márquez made their call to arms in a video published online in late August.

The FARC signed a peace deal brokered by Cuba with Bogotá in 2016 that allowed them to become a legal political party and granted them uncontested legislative seats, an unconstitutional move as the Colombian people voted against the deal in a national referendum. Despite the fact that only one senior FARC leader – the president of the political party, “Timochenko” – has not returned to terrorism, Colombian media refer to the large Santrich and Márquez faction as FARC “dissidents.”

Colombia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry noted in its letter to Havana that the FARC war on the Colombian people – which has so far taken the lives of two rural mayoral candidates and several other local politicians and relatives – elevates the urgency of bringing the ELN leaders to justice.

The ministry describes the Santrich and Márquez terrorism announcement as the “creation of a criminal group” that “violates their responsibilities within the peace deal” between the Colombian government and the FARC.

“Those who now turn their backs and betray the agreement they helped build announce an alliance with the National Liberation Army (ELN) terrorist group,” the letter read, “whose top leaders … are now located in the Republic of Cuba.”

The letter notes that Bogotá has acquired Interpol “red notices” for the individuals in question, which urge the extradition of any country aware that they are present within its borders. Colombia formally requested their extradition in January, but the Castro regime has ignored the request.

“The Republic of Colombia demands that the Republic of Cuba immediately hand all members of the ELN present in Cuban territory over to our judicial authorities,” the letter continued. If Cuba does not respond to the request, the foreign ministry wrote it would have to invoke United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, a document passed shortly after September 11, 2001, to facilitate the punishment of states that finance or harbor terrorists. The resolution orders states to “refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts.”

El Tiempo described the threat as “unprecedented.” Listing Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism would recall the extended period in which the United States also acknowledged the reality of terrorists using Cuba as a safe haven that ended during the Obama administration. The State Department under President Barack Obama removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2015 despite no evidence indicating that the Castro regime had stopped aiding the FARC or cooperating with the Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah. President Donald Trump has not moved to return Cuba to the list.

Santrich and Márquez announced a truce with the ELN in a video last month that surfaced months after the two disappeared from Colombia. Santrich, a senator, disappeared from the public eye after being charged with attempting to smuggle 10,000 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. The charges stemmed from activity conducted after the signing of the 2016 peace agreement. Márquez – who Bogotá offered a senate seat to but he did not accept – disappeared shortly thereafter. Their whereabouts remain unknown, though Colombian law enforcement officials have speculated that they have taken refuge in Venezuela under the auspices of Cuban state agent Nicolás Maduro, the ruling socialist dictator.

“Timochenko,” the lone holdout still against violence in the highest ranks of the FARC, told El Tiempo that he “highly doubts” Maduro is aiding the FARC.\

“I highly doubt Maduro is supporting the dissidents [most of the FARC leadership] from what I know of him, of the Bolivarian Revolution, and his support for peace,” “Timochenko said in an interview published Tuesday. “I don’t think Venezuela will change its policies now and bet on war.”

Since the announcement of the peace deal, unknown Marxist assailants have killed two local mayoral candidates: Orley García of the conservative Democratic Center party in Antioquía state and Karina García Sierra (no relation) of Cauca state. García Sierra had warned in an online video before her death that violent groups had threatened her to stop campaigning.

A third mayoral candidate, Betsaida Montejo Pérez of San Calixto, suffered a grenade bombing on her home, presumed to be the work of the FARC and ELN in tandem. Montejo was not home when the bombing occurred.

Dutch Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations Raymond Knops said recent hurricane disasters highlighted the need to be “prepared for different crisis scenarios” in the Caribbean.

Some of the enhanced funding is for security measures, including better coastal radar capability, more maritime patrols, and cameras to monitor beaches where migrants might come ashore. Other funds are earmarked for building more temporary shelters, detention centers, rescue equipment, and trained immigration agents.

Aruba is reportedly budgeting more money for schools and vaccinations to cope with the arrival of Venezuelan refugees. A sizable number of child refugees are abandoned by one or both parents as they look for work in other countries.

Migrant advocacy groups have criticized Curacao for being slow to establish an asylum process and refusing to allow Venezuelans to apply for temporary legal status.

“The government of Curaçao has been openly detaining and deporting people back to Venezuela, and without options to regularize their status, many Venezuelans are forced to live in hiding, in fear of the authorities, and at the mercy of employers who often exploit their irregular status,” Human Rights Watch complained in April.

In February, the regime of socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro announced it was closing the maritime border with the Dutch Caribbean islands to prevent the Netherlands from teaming up with the Venezuelan opposition to bring humanitarian aid to the starving country. Maduro’s officials denounced the aid program as a plot to undermine their government."
672,,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2019/09/10/report-kenyan-orders-mentorship-of-incompetent-cuban-slave-doctors/,2019-09-10T00:00:00,Report: Kenyan Orders Mentorship of ‘Incompetent’ Cuban Slave Doctors,"Kenyan doctors are decrying a government memorandum ordering them to mentor “incompetent” Cuban slave doctors as they cannot be trusted to work alone, noting that they opposed importing more doctors to the African country when so many native medical professionals are out of a job, Diario de Cuba reported on Monday.

The Spanish newspaper, citing Kenya’s Daily Nation, noted that Kenyan Health Secretary Susan Mochache reportedly issued the memorandum on August 7, but the Nation first made it public this weekend.

An alleged copy of the memorandum circulating in Kenyan media sources indicates that the government expected the Cuban doctors to be of high enough quality to mentor the Kenyans, but that the results of that project have “not been optimal” and that the government now needs for the reverse to happen to ensure that citizens’ health care does not suffer from the Cuban doctors’ inability to do their jobs.

The Daily Nation coupled the revelation of the memorandum with reports at the local level of Cuban slave doctors being unable to diagnose common diseases without the help of Kenyan doctors and being demoted for “incompetence,” fueling frustration among Kenyan doctors.

The Cuban communist regime makes an estimated $11 billion exporting doctors around the world. Upon leaving the country, the doctors receive a meager “living stipend” and have severe restrictions imposed on their mobility, contact with their families, and freedom of expression. The Castro regime keeps 75 percent of their salaries, and a doctor who chooses to leave the program is banned from entering Cuba for eight years.

Cuban doctors who have defected from the program have referred to it as slavery, and human rights advocates have compared it to prostitution.

The Daily Nation disclosed that the memorandum was directed to Kenyan medical superintendents, ordering them to make Kenyan doctors mentor their Cuban counterparts, and suggested that the order has “given credence to the concerns earlier raised by local medical practitioners that the programme was ill-advised.”

It cited unnamed medical sources who stated that the impetus for the mentorship order was a string of cases of “incompetence” on the part of the Cubans that has required Kenyan doctor intervention. Among them, the Kenyan newspaper lists the deregistration of a Cuban surgeon, barring him from practice and professional repercussions for a Cuban doctor who could not diagnose basic conditions like urinary tract infections without help from Kenyan doctors.

“The ministry wants to cover up their incompetence; making sure that there is a Kenyan medic on hand to step in when there is a problem,” a Daily Nation source said.

The alleged copy of the memorandum surfacing uses language that does not make entirely clear who is mentoring whom in the agreement, stating only that the program is not functioning in its “optimal” form currently.

“It is important to ensure that they are paired with Kenyan doctors in those stations for mentorship as per the bilateral agreement and recommendations of the Rapid Assessment team,” the text says. The Daily Nation deduced, noting the various cases of failures on the part of the Cuban doctors, that they are the ones in need of mentorship.

Confronted by reporters from the newspaper, the Ministry of Health bizarrely claimed that it had commanded the Cuban doctors to mentor the Kenyans, not vice versa, while also confirming the contents of the memorandum.

“The Cubans have been here treating patients, but they have not been transferring the knowledge to the Kenyans; so we wrote that circular to ensure that happens,” the ministry told the newspaper.

The Cuban slave doctor program has been extremely controversial in Kenya, where the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists’ Union (KMPDU) has insisted as many as 1,000 qualified doctors still need jobs and will compete for 100 fewer of them thanks to the Cubans. The deal would see Kenya accept 100 Cuban specialists, two per county, and Cuba take in 50 Cuban doctors for specialist training in Havana.

The Kenyan government chose to send doctors to train in Havana despite Cuba’s woeful education system and the poor experiences of other countries with the program. In one notable example, the government of the Pacific island of Tuvalu canceled its program to send doctors to train in Cuba in 2015 after they returned home with minimal healthcare skills, and only being able to communicate the little they knew in Spanish, a language not spoken in Tuvalu.

The Daily Nation reported last week that the Kenyan Medical Board is already finding that the doctors training in Cuba cannot fulfill the requirements to be certified to practice in the country.

As for the Cuban doctors in Kenya, the KMPDU sued the government in mid-2018 to block the Cubans from entering the country but lost the lawsuit.

“Statistics produced in this court by respondents are enough proof the specialists are urgently needed, especially upcountry, where Kenyan doctors have no interest,” the presiding judge ruled.

“Kenya has 1,000 doctors who are not employed. They have waited for deployment since May 2017. There are additional specialists who have been waiting for deployment to counties. Is there room for these Drs in Kenya?” Ouma Oluga, the secretary-general of the KMPDU, said when the government initially announced its plan to import 100 doctors to work in the country.

“The decision by the government to bring in doctors from Cuba should take into consideration the more than 1,200 Kenyan doctors currently unemployed since May 2017,” Mwachonda Chibanzi, another KMPDU official, told media last year.

Kenyan doctors have also protested that the Cubans are much more expensive to hire even without being paid a salary. Reports from around the time that the deal was signed revealed that the Kenyan government would pay the Castro regime between $7,833 and $8,791 per doctor a month, with no obligation on Havana to pass the money over to the doctors. A Kenyan doctor makes, in contrast, an average of $15,000 a year.

Nairobi never officially made the provisions of the deal public.

At the end of last month, Iván Márquez, a commander in the U.S.-designated terrorist group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) – called on his followers to take up arms against the Colombian government again. Márquez’ call to arms came less than three years after the FARC signed the peace agreement in late 2016.

According to a satellite figures-based report issued this year by the Colombian government, the acres of forest lost across the country significantly increased by nearly 60 percent from 2015 (306,497 acres), the year before the FARC demobilized, to 2018 (487,190 acres).

Between 2016, when rebels agreed to the peace deal, and last year, the overall loss of forest in all of Colombia reached an estimated 1,472,075 acres or an area nearly 34 times the size of Washington, DC.

Deforestation levels in all of Colombia did drop by ten percent from 543,565 in 2017 to 487,190 the following year.

In the Amazon Rainforest alone, often referred to as the Earth’s lung, Colombia has reportedly lost about 870,792 acres of forest, or an area about 20 times the size of the U.S. capital, during the peace deal — between 2016 and 2018.

Deforestation in the Amazon also dropped about four percent from 2017 (356,195 acres) to 2018 (341,440).

The Colombian government deemed coca cultivation, cocaine production, extensive cattle ranching, road construction, expansion of the agricultural frontier, as well as illegal mining and logging as the top contributors to deforestation in the country.

Several news reports have linked FARC rebels to several of the illicit activities fueling deforestation, including coca cultivation in addition to illegal mining and logging. There was also a rush of land-grabbing for cattle ranches after the FARC, which used to hide in the forest, reached the peace pact with the government.

The FARC is considered one of the most prominent cocaine traffickers in Latin America. Since the Marxist group signed the peace deal, Colombia has again become the world’s top cultivator and producer of cocaine.

Cocaine cultivation and production in the South American country reached the highest levels since the United States began keeping track after the peace agreement. A recent White House report revealed that last year coca cultivation in Colombia covered an area of about 513,979 acres that yielded “887 pure metric tons” of cocaine.

The 2018 figures mark a “minor decrease” from the 516,450 acres under coca cultivation that produced “900 pure metric tons” of cocaine the previous year, the White House noted.

Lethal cocaine overdoses in the United States, one of the top destinations of the drug produced in Colombia, have dramatically increased since the signing of the peace deal between the FARC and Bogota. In 2016, deadly cocaine overdoses in the United States resulted in a record 10,458 deaths, followed by 14,069 in 2017, and 14,794 last year, for a total of 39,321 fatalities, figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show.

While several world leaders blamed the conservative government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for the recent fires in the Amazon, they have been mum about the FARC’s contribution to deforestation in the same region."

Under former President Juan Manuel Santos, Bogotá legalized the FARC as a political party and granted it ten seats in the Colombian Senate uncontested. Two of the men who received those seats, terrorists “Jesús Santrich” and “Iván Márquez,” appeared in a video two weeks ago announcing that, despite the peace deal agreement, the FARC would once again take up arms and kill people who stood in the way of its vast cocaine empire.

The disintegration of the FARC deal followed the arrest this year of Santrich, who is still technically a senator, for allegedly trying to smuggle 10,000 kilograms of cocaine into the United States after signing the 2016 peace deal.

The nominal head of the FARC, the terrorist “Timochenko,” has publicly opposed the new war and claimed that 90 percent of FARC terrorists have given up violence. Many mainstream media sites refer to the FARC leadership that called for a new war on the Colombian government as “dissidents” because “Timochenko” has not joined them.

Santos won the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize for legitimizing the FARC.

El Tiempo, one of Colombia’s largest newspapers, reported on Sunday that García was shot “over ten times” and taken as quickly as possible to a nearby hospital, but “due to his critical state, it became necessary to transport him to the regional capital,” Medellín. He died on the flight over.

Police have reportedly not arrested anyone in connection with the killing. Col. Giovanny Buitrago, the commander of Antioquia’s police forces, told reporters that García was shot in the back by someone hiding in the shrubbery of the rural area where he was working on his mayoral campaign. The wounds appeared to be, he said, from a shotgun.

Colombia’s RCN radio reported that “initial reports” indicate that “FARC dissidents” were responsible for the murder. The individual leading the particular group of FARC terrorists believed to be responsible for the murder, known as “Cabuyo,” is also believed to be responsible for “the murder of three Continental Gold geologists in September 2018,” according to RCN.

The Argentine outlet Infobae noted following García’s death that Colombia’s national ombudsman office has documented 15 homicides and 192 threats against individuals campaigning for political office nationwide this year alone.

García’s death closely follows that of Karina García Sierra, who aspired to be the mayor of Suárez, Cauca, on the other side of the country. García Sierra, her mother, an allied city council candidate, and three others were found dead in their vehicles last weekend, apparently shot to death. The vehicle also appeared to have been burned. Authorities traced the death back to another FARC “dissident” terrorist, known as “Majimbu,” and offered nearly $45,000 for information on his whereabouts.

García Sierra had warned shortly before her death that she had received threats from “armed groups” to cease her campaign, and urged her opponents to stop using incendiary language against her. “My God, don’t be irresponsible, this could have fatal consequences for me,” she pleaded in a video published on her social media sites.

Montejo, the candidate for mayorship of San Calixto, North Santander, was not home when a grenade crashed into her bedroom and exploded. That attack also occurred last week, in a town notorious as a hotbed of FARC and ELN drug trafficking activities. Unlike García Sierra, Montejo had not made any public attacks on local terrorist groups in her campaign.

Orley García was a member of the Democratic Center, a conservative, anti-terrorist political party that staunchly opposed the peace deal with the FARC. Shortly after his death, the head of the party, former President Álvaro Uribe, published a FARC missive distributed in central Viotá, Colombia, threatening Democratic Center candidates with violence if they did not stop campaigning.

“Death to Uribe’s paramilitaries,” the letter is titled. “We have decided to once again take up armed activities and from this moment on we declare Uribe’s candidates our military targets.”

Uribe, who imported the American counter-terrorism strategy used in Afghanistan to force the FARC into exile in Cuba during his tenure, posted a video campaigning with Democratic Center candidates and vowing not to hide.

“We will not abandon our candidates … if criminals are looking for us to hide, they had better be the ones looking for hiding spots because with the armed forces and the constitution we will travel the country to support our candidates and democracy,” Uribe said.

The true FARC dissidents — the individuals in the FARC who have condemned the current terrorism campaign — are currently denouncing the Colombian government for rescinding the immunity granted to some FARC terrorists as part of the 2016 peace deal the group has overtly abandoned.

Prensa Latina, a Cuban state outlet, reported this week that FARC leaders are condemning the arrest of “comrade” Edwin Murillo, a FARC terrorist, for crimes committed during his active tenure in the group.

The Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) and the Cuba Decide election movement organized a march on Sunday to venerate the Virgin Mary and demand that the communist Castro regime respect the basic human rights of its people. March organizers said the event would especially express solidarity with the Ladies in White, a dissident organization whose sole act of protest is to attend Catholic Mass on Sundays with the images of political prisoners so that they are not forgotten.

Some began referring to the event as the “Sunflower March” in honor of the flower traditionally offered to Our Lady of Charity on her feast day. Activists on the island reported that Cuban communist police began banning the sale of sunflowers over the weekend in response to the growing use of the flower as a symbol of freedom. Sunflowers are also used to venerate Ochun, the Yoruba god to which Our Lady of Charity is syncretized in Cuba’s santería religion, as yellow is the goddess’s signature color.

""La noche no termina, más yo sé, que por las grietas del alma de éste pueblo que sufre, se ha filtrado la luz y vuelven a crecer las grande flores amarillas, que nadie cultivaba , de las cuales el nombre ya olvidé"" Del poema Los Girasoles, 2002 pic.twitter.com/FxOwK0yf5L — CUBADECIDE (@CUBADECIDE) September 6, 2019

The Castro regime regularly employs its police, undercover officers, and makeshift mobs to arrest, beat, intimidate, and otherwise abuse the Ladies in White.

Dissidents accused police forces of raiding their homes and looting them of items that have nothing to do with their protests, including hard-to-find basics on the island such as milk and cooking oil. Some who escaped prosecution suffered heavy fines for arbitrary crimes such as “harm to the environment,” or simply supporting an unlawful protest.

Cuban Prisoners Defenders, an organization that works with UNPACU to document and denounce the imprisonment of peaceful pro-democracy dissidents, listed 98 people arrested in Cuba since Friday out of fear that they may possibly join the march on Sunday. The group noted that these were only the arrested they could confirm with certainty, emphasizing that the real arrest count easily totals over 100 people now behind bars in the last three days.

“After besieging dozens of homes of activists belonging to the pacific democratic opposition in Cuba, the island’s government, using the State Security forces and special troops, has raided several of these homes, stolen from them, and detained many more than one hundred activists, primarily to prevent [the occurring of] a march organized nationwide,” Cuban Prisoners Defenders explained in a press release Monday.

“Arrests every September 8 have become, unfortunately, as ‘traditional’ for human rights activists as the celebration of the beloved Cachita [Our Lady of Charity], although the call to march this year in parks and other public places has unleashed a substantially larger wave of violence,” the NGO noted.

The Cuban Prisoners Defenders list of detentions does not include forced house arrests in which the outside of known dissidents’ homes are “militarized” and the dissidents are threatened with physical violence if they walk out of their houses. In neither of these cases are the individuals provided with any legal justification for their apprehension.

“More arrests since early morning,” Ferrer, the head of UNPACU, wrote on Twitter early Sunday morning. “As of yesterday, 30 activists have disappeared. Their location is unknown. The families do not know their whereabouts. There will be more arrests as 10 a.m. approaches. At that hour we will march from many places!!!”

#Cuba Más arrestos desde temprano. Desde ayer 30 activistas se encuentran desaparecidos. No se sabe donde le tienen. Las familias desconocen su paradero. Habrán más detenciones en la medida que se acerquen las 10 a.m.. A esa hora saldremos a las calles en muchos lugares!!! — José Daniel Ferrer (@jdanielferrer) September 8, 2019

UNPACU’s headquarters are in Santiago de Cuba, on the far east of the island hundreds of miles from Havana, where organization leader José Daniel Ferrer lives. Ferrer was one of the first arrested on Sunday, local sources reported. Military also surrounded the UNPACU headquarters on numerous occasions. The most violent occurred on Sunday morning in anticipation of the march for Virgin Mary and culminated in Ferrer’s arrest and the detention of about a dozen others organized to protest. Eyewitnesses told Diario de Cuba that police beat Ferrer and his 16-year-old son, who often partakes in democracy activities with UNPACU, before taking them away.

The outlet noted that Cuba’s state wireless provider appeared to shut off phone service to most of the UNPACU contacts the newspaper has on the island for the weekend.

Prior to his arrest, Ferrer met with America’s Charge d’Affairs Mara Tekach, who currently runs the U.S. embassy in Havana. The embassy responded to his arrest by posting a message to Ferrer from Tekach: “The United States supports you and the people of Cuba in their struggle for freedom. We demand freedom for those detained. The Cuban people deserve more.”

El pueblo cubano merece más. https://t.co/XqAFzKgx8t — Embajada EE.UU. Cuba (@USEmbCuba) September 8, 2019

Cubans and Cuban-Americans in the United States also responded to UNPACU’s call by organizing events in Florida to both honor the Virgin Mary and support Cuban dissidents on the island.

“The Cuban problem does not belong to the elderly in the exile community, the Cuban problem belongs to all of us. We young people must also sacrifice for Cuba, yell out ‘Free Cuba,’ … so that those suffering all the oppression on the island can be heard and the world can know that Cuba needs freedom,” the Pichy Boys, a comedy duo with a weekly show on Miami television, said on Sunday, attending a sunflower event in their hometown. The duo have launched a campaign to pressure Cuban artists who make money in the United States to defend the human rights of their people.

UNPACU and the Cuba Decide group, which is attempting to use constitutional means to force the Castro regime to offer its people free and fair elections, initially announced the march to express solidarity with “journalists and independent artists, defenders of religious liberty and LGBTI activists suffering persecution, and all peaceful people and organizations who promote respect for human rights and the change to a democratic system in Cuba.”

According to the report, the situation has become so severe that many people are now turning to sorcerers who can provide some “light” to their lives. Workers at the Temple of Fortune store, located in the center of Caracas, reveal that every day they hear different stories from each of their customers who try to buy products there, ranging from tobacco to candles.

“Different types of people arrive to buy candles, they tell us that with that they can improve their fortune … different people arrive every day, they even ask for rituals for love,” said one of the employees.

While majority Catholic, many Venezuelans also engage in spiritual and magical practices outside the Church. La Patilla highlighted the legend of Sorte mountain, located in the Bruzual municipality of Yaracuy state, where believers from the indigenous cult of Maria Lionza visit to perform rituals with the hope of improving their lives. Many still see the practice as taboo and a form of a religious cult.

Every October the “Baile en Candela” (“Fire Dance”) is performed by the local indigenous community, often catching the eye of both the national and international press.

The growing popularity of witchcraft has led to the raiding of cemeteries in search of valuables and human remains for witchcraft rituals, France24 reported last year.

The use of witchcraft has also inspired multiple reports theorizing that the late socialist dictator Hugo Chávez was interested in such activities. In May, one of Chávez’s close military aides leveled scandalous accusations against his Cuban ally and counterpart Fidel Castro, suggesting that he killed Chávez after seducing him with “women” and “witchcraft.” He did not provide any additional information or potential evidence for the claim.

In separate but coordinated letters, both dated August 28, Cardinals Raymond Burke and Walter Brandmüller warned fellow cardinals that the synod poses serious challenges to perennial Church teaching, Catholic News Agency (CNA) reported.

“Some points of the synod’s Instrumentum laboris (working document) seem not only in dissonance with respect to the authentic teaching of the Church, but even contrary to it,” Cardinal Walter Brandmüller said in his letter.

The cardinal criticized the document’s “nebulous formulations” as well as the “proposed creation of new ecclesial ministries for women” and, above all, the proposal of ordaining married men to the priesthood in certain circumstances.

Cardinal Brandmüller’s concerns for the upcoming synod, scheduled to take place in the Vatican October 6-27, go beyond problems with the text and extend to the choice of certain liberal prelates to oversee the synod’s proceedings.

“The sole fact that Cardinal (Claudio) Hummes is the president of the synod and thus will exercise a grave influence in a negative sense, suffices to have a well-founded and realistic concern, as much as in the case of bishops (Erwin) Kräutler, (Franz-Josef) Overbeck, etc.,” Brandmüller said.

“We must face serious challenges to the integrity of the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental and hierarchical structure of the Church and its Apostolic Tradition,” said Brandmüller, a Church historian. “With all this has been created a situation never before seen in the Church’s history, not even during the Arian crisis of the fourth and fifth century.”

In his letter, Brandmüller urges his brother cardinals to “seize this opportunity to correct, according to the teachings of the Church, certain positions expressed in the Instrumentum laboris of the pan-Amazonian synod.”

For his part, Cardinal Raymond Burke, a canon lawyer and the former head of the Vatican’s highest court, also wrote the other cardinals, expressing concerns similar to those Cardinal Brandmüller outlined.

The synod’s working document is “marked by language which is not clear in its meaning,” Burke states, noting that it “contradicts the constant teaching of the Church on the relationship between the created world and God, the uncreated Creator, and man, created in the image and likeness of God to cooperate with him as guardian of the created world.”

The text undermines Church teaching regarding “the unicity and universality of the salvation brought by Christ,” he declares, as an example of what they call a “petrified doctrine” that is the product of a particular culture.

The working document also obscures — or even denies — “the truth that God has revealed Himself fully and perfectly through the mystery of the Incarnation of the Redeemer, the Son of God,” Burke insists.

The “disturbing propositions of the Instrumentum laboris,” Burke writes, “portend an apostasy from the Catholic faith.”

This is not the first time Cardinal Burke has expressed his grave misgivings regarding the upcoming synod and the text that will serve as a guide for its deliberations.

Asked last August 13 if the working document could become definitive for the Catholic Church, the cardinal replied, “It cannot be. The document is an apostasy. This cannot become the teaching of the Church, and God willing, the whole business will be stopped.”

“We have had enough wars,” the President said at UNGA in New York through a translator, adding:

We don’t want our country to be part of any regional or international conflict. Nor do we want our country to be used to settle regional and international scores. Our people have paid a high price by wars and conflict, and Iraq will not be a part of any more wars by one group against the other.

“Iraq will not be a launching pad for aggression for any or our neighboring countries,” he also said.

Iraq borders Shiite-majority Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. On Wednesday, Salih met with U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the day during the UNGA, the White House noted on Tuesday.

The two leaders discussed “ways to enhance an already robust partnership on issues such as security, trade, and energy, as well as President Trump’s strong support for a continued fight against ISIS [Islamic State],” the White House wrote on Twitter:

President @realDonaldTrump met with President @BarhamSalih of the Republic of Iraq to discuss ways to enhance an already robust partnership on issues such as security, trade, and energy, as well as President Trump’s strong support for a continued fight against ISIS. pic.twitter.com/p3MCalXP1C — The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 24, 2019

Salih said U.S. and local forces demolished ISIS’ territorial caliphate. Nevertheless, America’s fight against the group continues.

There are still ISIS remnants that are trying to regroup, he warned. Iraq is home to tens of thousands of pro-Iran militias who consider the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia their enemy.

Until recently, relations between Iran and Iraq rendered Baghdad one of Saudi Arabia’s primary foes. The two former enemies — Iraq and Saudi Arabia — however, are reportedly preparing to start engaging in several economic endeavors. Salih highlighted the thaw in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in recent years. Several Iraqi leaders, including Salih, visited the Sunni Kingdom in recent years, marking a policy change to sever Iran’s strong influence in Iraq.

Iraq’s president has acknowledged the policy of change that is pulling Baghdad away from Tehran. Iran still holds strong political and military influence in Iraq.

“The security of the [Iraq — Middle East] region is contingent upon a good neighbor relationship between Iraq and its surrounding countries,” Salih said.

Salih declared:

Our relationship is strengthened by our Arab and Gulf depth, and we insist on [improving] these relationships and developing them as an important part of our stability and security. We also care about our relationship with our neighbor Iran [with whom] we enjoy ties of cultural and religious connections as well as different interests. And we also care about our neighbor to the north Turkey and we are exerting efforts on raising levels of our bilateral relations with all our neighbors.

There is animosity between Turkey and the Saudis, but they benefit from a robust economic relationship.

Currently, Iran is facing economic pressure from the United States in the form of crippling sanctions. This month, after the massive attack, Saudi Arabia joined the relatively small U.S.-led naval coalition to protect shipping in the Persian Gulf region from a desperate Iran. The only other alliance partners so far are the United Kingdom, Australia, and Bahrain. Iran has attacked oil tankers in the region in May and June.

Iran is increasingly facing financial woes after the U.S. pulled out of the controversial 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and Washington-led world powers last year. U.S. President Trump reimposed sanctions slapped as part of a wave of unprecedented restrictions crippling the Iranian economy.

Since Trump pulled America out of the Iran pact last year, there have been multiple attacks against oil tankers navigating in the sea near Iran. The U.S. blames Iran, but Tehran denies the accusations

Yemen’s Iranian-allied Shiite Houthi rebels have also claimed responsibility for various attacks on Saudi Arabia, including the recent one targeting the oil facility. Initially, there was speculation that Iranian allies may have carried out the latest attacks from Iraqi soil, but the United States has cleared Iraq, which shares a border with Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. also dismissed Houthi allegations that they carried out the devastating attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure.

A willing Iraq could potentially help the United States and Saudi Arabia counter Iran’s expansion in the region."

As a Muslim, Hazza Al Mansouri has to pray five times a day, but the question is how he would do it – due to time and space constraints. Hazza will be orbiting the earth every 90 minutes, which means he will be witnessing 16 sunsets and sunrises a day. Observant Muslims are expected to pray and fast according to the time of day no matter where they are.

“As a professional pilot, I’m used to praying while flying at high speed,” Hazza said at a news conference in Baikonur on Tuesday when asked about praying, Gulf News reports. “Of course in space it will look a little different. I plan to record a prayer as I go down to earth, ” he added.

So how will the 35-year-old meet his religious obligations while onboard the International Space Station?

﻿

Dubai Islamic affairs have tackled this dilemma for Hazza with a prayer booklet, and recommended he follow the timings of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.

A previous Muslim astronaut, Malaysia’s Sheikh Muszapher Shukor, was advised to follow the time of day in Kazakhstan where his rocket took off, officials said.

But Mecca, as Islam’s holiest city, “takes precedent” as there is “no point in following the timings of the launch country,” the UAE booklet says. They advised him to face Earth while praying – if at all possible.

Dubai officials say Hazza should also do his best to observe the ritual of ablution, or washing oneself before prayer.

However, if water is not readily available, he could use a stone or grain of sand instead, they suggest.

Hazza is set to return to Earth with NASA’s Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin on October 3. Skripochka and Meir are set to remain on the ISS until the spring of 2020."

General Assembly on Tuesday with a speech consisting largely of rhetorical questions designed to stress the importance of global issues such as climate change, economic disparities, terrorism, and especially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he said can only be resolved by giving the Palestinians their own state.

“What will our future look like if millions of the world’s young people continue to be denied the rich fruits of new technology and global wealth?” Abdullah asked. “Can we afford to ignore the crisis of exclusion? Or will we do the right thing, support the energies and talents of all the world’s youth, and drive all economies forward through fair and inclusive global growth?”

Abdullah said that “water-scarce countries like Jordan already know the dangers of climate change” and said “a global crisis demands global action.”

“Why in the 21st Century are crises still displacing millions of people across our world?” he asked. “There are more forced displacements today than at any time since World War Two. What will tomorrow’s world look like if we do not help end these crises, and give refugees and hosts alike the support they need to meet the future?”

“How is it that today people can still be disrespected and victimized for their faith?” Abdullah wondered. “Atrocities at mosques, churches, synagogues, and temples have shocked the conscience of the world – but so should the dark criminal ideas from across the ideological spectrum that drive these and other attacks. Hard work by all of us is needed to defeat these groups and their message of hate and mistrust.”

Abdullah stressed the importance of giving “young men and women everywhere a stake in a positive future” to immunize them against the lure of extremist ideologies.

“The forces of violence seek out the vulnerable and excluded,” he said. “Can we afford to abandon the world’s young people to extremism and despair?”

The Jordanian king asserted that no crisis has done more damage to the stability of the entire world than the “core conflict of my region, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.”

“Neither side has achieved the durable peace that a secure future depends on,” he lamented. “Regional and world stability has continued to pay the price.”

“It is a terrible irony that the land holy to three faiths – faiths that share the great commandment to love one’s neighbor – should ever be a place of conflict. This is the land where prophets walked, the land where generations of Muslims, Christians, and Jews have sought to live in obedience to God, teaching their children compassion, mercy, and respect for others. Segregation, forced displacement, violence, and mistrust do not belong in this holy land,” he said.

Having said that, Abdullah proceeded to inveigh against the “occupation” (the Israelis) without a word of criticism for the actions of the Palestinians.

“40 years ago, my father – his late majesty King Hussein, who loved peace – stood in this very chamber and decried the occupation and attempts, in his words, ‘to eradicate from the world’s memory centuries of history, and tradition, and spiritual, moral, and cultural ideals,’” Abdullah said.

“It is a global moral tragedy that the occupation continues. No occupation, no displacements, no acts of force can erase people’s history, hopes, or rights, or change the true heritage of our shared values among the three monolithic faiths. And nothing can take away the international rights of the Palestinian people to equality, justice, and self-determination,” he said to applause from the audience.

“Young people ask me, why does not the world stand up for Palestinian rights?” Abdullah said. “Isn’t it time to answer them by showing that global justice and human rights belong to them too? It begins with respect for the holy sites and rejecting all attempts to alter the legal status of East Jerusalem and the authentic historic character of the holy city Jerusalem.”

“What lessons do we teach young people when armed personnel enter Al-Aqsa Mosque even as Muslim worshipers gather to pray?” he said.

“As a Hashemite custodian, I am bound by a special duty to protect Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites, but all of us have a stake and a moral obligation to uphold religious freedom and human rights. So let us safeguard the holy city for all humanity as a unifying city of peace,” he urged.

Abdullah said that only a “two-state solution” using the “June 4, 1967 lines” as borders could create a “just, lasting, and durable peace” between the Israelis and Palestinians.

“The two-state solution is the only genuine solution, because what is the alternative? One state, segregated, with unequal laws dependent on force, betraying the deepest values of the good people on both sides? That is a formula for enduring conflict, not a path to security, stability, and peace,” he warned."

The committee said the new results came after an investigation which found several instances of apparent election fraud.

The change gives Likud 32 seats, while UTJ drops from eight seats to seven. Despite the extra seat, Likud remains a seat behind Blue and White, and the new tally does not shift the balance of power between the rival blocs headed by Likud’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White challenger Benny Gantz.

Netanyahu has been endorsed as preferred prime minister by 55 MKs, including from his own party and UTJ, which signed a pact together with Shas and Yamina agreeing to enter coalition negotiations as a bloc. Gantz has the backing of 54 MKs, including from his own party, center-left allies, and much of the Joint List.

In a letter to Columbia University President Lee Bollinger, Lauder said the last straw for him was the university’s invitation to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, who is slated to speak on campus on Wednesday. Mohamed is known for his extremist views and for repeatedly espousing antisemitism, including smearing Jews as “hook-nosed” and claiming “Jews rule the world by proxy.”

Amid calls from opponents of antisemitism to nix the visit, Bollinger defended the invitation, writing in a letter to student groups that “this form of open engagement can sometimes be difficult, even painful.”

“But to abandon this activity would be to limit severely our capacity to understand and confront the world as it is, which is a central and utterly serious mission for any academic institution,” Bollinger argued.

In his letter to Bollinger, Lauder retorted, “I understand, from your statement, that you believe it is in the interest of education that all views are aired at Columbia. With all the world leaders and statesmen in New York this week, I wonder why this man’s views are so vital?”

The Jewish leader called on donors to withhold future contributions:

I am not a Columbia alum. I went to Penn and my family and I have been among its largest benefactors. I will honestly tell you that if Amy Gutmann at Penn were as consistent in allowing antisemitic speakers on her campus as you are at Columbia, I would seriously consider stopping my funding. Accordingly, I will be encouraging all of my friends to immediately cease any of their contributions to your institution until such a time as antisemitic despots are no longer welcome on your campus.

Columbia and Bollinger faced widespread criticism in September 2007 for playing host to then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, infamous for denying the Holocaust, rejecting Israel’s right to exist and calling for the Jewish state’s destruction. Iran is a leading state sponsor of worldwide terrorism.

Lauder noted Ahmadinejad’s speech as well as instances of pro-Israel students reportedly facing an atmosphere of intimidation.

The World Jewish Congress leader wrote:

I have watched, with growing concern, the incidents and incitement directed against Israel on the Columbia campus, that are nominally called political activity, which have made many Jewish students on your campus less than comfortable. Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, have been understandably upset with this ongoing situation at Columbia, because the complaints from students have grown, along with the increased vitriol against them. So with that as the backdrop, along with the 2007 speech by a hate filled, Holocaust-denying Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, I am joining the growing chorus of those upset over your giving Mohamed an opportunity to air his anti-Semitism on your campus.

In his response to critics, Bollinger wrote that Mohamed’s invitation should not be taken as “validation” or an “endorsement” of the politician’s views.

“I find the anti-semitic statements of Prime Minister Mahathir to be abhorrently contrary to what we stand for, and deserving condemnation. Nevertheless, it is in these times that we are most strongly resolved to insist that our campus remain an open forum and to protect the freedoms essential to our university community,” Bollinger wrote."

Speaking on Israel’s i24NEWS (video above), Klein said that as long as Israel does not have a stable, permanent government in place Iran might feel it can get away with escalating regional tensions.

“I will tell you one party at least that is not going to sit around and wait. And that is Iran,” stated Klein.

“What is happening in the Middle East today is very serious. Iran is brazen. They are out of control. And I think that they could smell an opportunity coming out of Israel if a unity government or some sort of stable coalition isn’t formed very quickly. Iran is not going to sit around and wait for a unity deal.”

Last week’s national elections left both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party unable to form a coalition without agreeing to a unity deal between them. Israel is currently ruled by an interim government led by Netanyahu.

During the election campaign, Gantz said that he is open to a unity coalition with Likud if the party first ousts Netanyahu, who faced an indictment hearing next week regarding allegations of bribery and corruption. Netanyahu has strongly denied the allegations and can legally serve as prime minister unless any formal conviction takes place and that could take over a year.

Netanyahu is negotiating with a bloc of religious and nationalist parties and would not agree to a unity coalition if he is not the head of Likud.

There is also the issue of whether any unity deal would see Gantz and Netanyahu rotate the premiership and which leader will first be tasked by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to attempt to form a coalition that must consist of more than 60 seats in the 120 seat Knesset.

Iran two weeks ago was fingered for carrying out aerial strikes on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.

Klein, meanwhile, argued that the biggest loser of the latest election was the Israeli left, with results slated to be finalized tomorrow. Left wing parties have traditionally made the creation of a Palestinian state into a major policy objective.

The Labor-Gesher alliance is projected to only get 6 seats, a devastating fall from grace for Israel’s Labor party which historically was the largest or second largest party in the Knesset. Labor needed to run in a coalition with Gesher so it didn’t fall below the threshold of not winning enough votes to enter the Knesset.

The leftist Meretz party also needed to merge with another leftist party to form the Democratic Union in order to get enough seats to enter the Knesset with a four seat minimum. The union of those parties is only slated to win five seats.

Asked by the i24NEWS host if it would be better for Netanyahu to get the “first crack” at forming a coalition, Klein replied: “I think whether he gets the first crack or the second crack at the end of the day the Israeli electorate spoke and they want, it seems, a unity government.”

“You look, though, at the results of this election. This clearly was a loss for the left in Israel or what’s left of the left. So it seems like the dividing lines are more along religious. Ultra-religious versus secular and not right-left.”"

General Assembly on Tuesday to either impose global nuclear disarmament or establish laws that allow any nation to develop nuclear weapons, as the status quo breeds “inequality.”

Erdogan repeated his anti-Security Council mantra, “the world is bigger than five,” a reference to the five permanent members of the Security Council: China, Russia, America, France, and the U.K., all of which are nuclear powers.

He also boasted of Turkey’s repeated violations of Syrian and Iraqi sovereignty in attempts to bomb Kurdish targets in both areas. Turkey shares a border with Syria and routinely sends fighter jets into Syrian airspace, much to the chagrin of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Erdogan’s troops target Syrian Kurdish troops allied with America, however, not Assad’s forces or Shiite terrorist groups like Hezbollah.

The Turkish president has never explicitly said he wants Turkey to become a nuclear-armed nation, but this month decried as unfair the fact that Turkey signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and thus cannot possess nuclear weapons legally.

Erdogan opened his speech Tuesday with a warning that “the international community is gradually losing its ability to find lasting solutions to challenges such as terrorism, hunger, misery, and climate change.”

“It is unacceptable to see that one part of the world lives in luxury and enjoys the benefit of prosperity, while people in other parts of the world suffer in the hands of poverty, misery, and illiteracy,” he continued, outraged that some countries were discussing “robotics” and advanced technology in the face of extreme underdevelopment around the world.

“It is obvious that today, neither the rights nor the responsibilities are shared appropriately,” he proclaimed.

“We cannot leave the fate of humanity up to the discretion of a handful of countries … the world is greater than five. It is high time that we change our current mentality, our institutions, our organizations, and our rules,” Erdogan declared.

He brought up the existence of legal nuclear powers as an example.

“The inequality between nuclear states and nonnuclear states is enough to undermine global balances. It bothers us, like anyone else, that weapons of mass destruction are used as leverage in every crisis, instead of their total elimination,” Erdogan said. “Nuclear power should either be forbidden for all or permissible for everyone.”

Erdogan also took the majority of credit for the elimination of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq and Syria, omitting the extensive work that the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) did to eradicate ISIS jihadis from Raqqa, the former capital of the group’s “caliphate,” with the aid of the American military. Erdogan’s government considers the YPG a terrorist organization and has pressured Washington to abandon its most effective ally on the ground against ISIS.

At the U.N., Erdogan called for the “elimination of the [Kurdistan Workers’ Party] PKK and YPG terrorist organizations.” The PKK are a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist group active largely in Iraq against the Islamic State. Yazidi witnesses in Sinjar – a northern Iraqi Kurdish region that ISIS overran – have credited the PKK with a significant role in defeating ISIS there, as well as staying to help the Yazidis rebuild and defend themselves. The PKK do not have friendly relations with the Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq (KRG), but do reportedly maintain ties with the YPG.

“We will not be able to find a permanent solution to the Syrian conflict if we fail to handle all terrorist organizations with the same perspective,” Erdogan said, urging the United States to treat the YPG like the Islamic State despite its key efforts in defeating the latter.

Erdogan also celebrated the millions of Syrian refugees currently in Turkey.

“Turkey today is the most generous country in terms of humanitarian aid given the radio of humanitarian assistance to GDP,” he said. “We are currently hosting five million refugees. In other words, there are more asylum seekers in Turkey than the total population of 29 states in the United States.”

Among other topics Erdogan touched upon in his extensive speech, the Turkish leader praised late Muslim Brotherhood member and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi; condemned Israel for alleged oppression of Palestinians; demanded Turkish control of Cyprus; and shared a photo of the late Aylan Kurdi, a Syrian refugee child who drowned attempting to reach Europe, in an attempt to galvanize the world to do more to support Syrian war refugees.

General Assembly on Tuesday.

In practice, this meant both a general call to respect national sovereignty and a specific warning that non-Arab powers should not meddle in the affairs of Arab nations, a warning Sisi repeated in several different contexts throughout his address.

Sisi saluted his administration for embarking upon “an ambitious plan to comprehensively advance society,” including “decisively combating terrorism and launching the most ambitious economic reform in [Egypt’s] modern history.”

He said these reforms were “wholeheartedly embraced by the Egyptian people, who have graciously shouldered the burden of their successful implementation in a manner that exceeded all expectations.”

Reminding the audience that Egypt currently chairs the African Union, Sisi praised the “principle of African solutions to African problems,” a “continent-wide vision that is based on our common history, unity of destiny, and confidence in our ability to achieve progress towards integration and upholding the interests of our peoples.”

Sisi praised initiatives like the African Union Center for Reconstruction and Development and the Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development as positive steps toward realizing the potential of Africa, but the balance of his speech laid out some problems that have proven painfully resistant to both “African solutions” and U.N. multilateralism, such as the savage civil wars in Yemen and Syria and the utter disintegration of Libya.

In each case, Sisi declared the urgent need for “political” solutions but offered few suggestions for what those solutions would look like.

“I say that the time has come to take a decisive stance to end the protracted crisis in Yemen through the implementation of a political solution based on the well-known parameters,” he said. “We need to end foreign interventions by non-Arab regional parties which seek to curtail Arab national security.”

“We also need to address the unprecedented threats facing the Arabian Gulf region, including threats facing navigation, as well as recent attacks on oil installations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he added. Those attacks were the work of Iran, which is also the primary “non-Arab regional party” involved in the Yemeni civil war. Sisi did not call the Iranians out by name.

On the “protracted crisis” in Libya, Sisi said the conflict “needs to be stopped” by taking a “bold and decisive stand to address the root causes of the Libyan crisis comprehensively.”

Sisi said part of this comprehensive solution would involve “addressing the grave imbalance of the distribution of wealth and power, and the absence of public oversight by the Libyan people’s elected representatives over political and economic decision-making.” He decried the influence of local militias and foreign powers on the chaos in Libya.

Sisi called for an equally comprehensive solution to the “longest-standing crisis in the Middle East, namely the Palestinian cause.”

“The persistence of this cause without a just solution based on international resolutions calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital does not only mean the continuation of the plight of the Palestinian people, but it also entails the continued depletion of the resources of the peoples of the Middle East,” he said.

“I say that Arabs are open to the realization of a just and comprehensive peace,” he declared. “The Arab peace initiative is still on the table, and there remains an opportunity to launch a new phase in the Middle East. However, we need bold decisions that restore the rights to the Palestinians that pave the way for a major change in the reality of this region.”

Sisi promised that if the Palestinian issue is resolved in this way, it would “lead to the establishment of a security and economic system in the Middle East that is based on peace, security, cooperation, and common interests.”

Sisi stressed the importance of combating terrorism “by confronting all terrorist organizations with no exception” and holding accountable “all those who support terrorism, whether through funding, or whether through weapons, or whether through safe havens or media platforms.”

The Egyptian president called on the United Nations to address the “imbalance in the composition and the shortcomings in the decision-making process” of the U.N. Security Council.

“We must guarantee a balanced representation in the Security Council, and with regard to our African continent, we must work to rectify the historical injustice our continent has been subject to,” he said."

Report Condemns BDS, Denying Israel’s Right to Exist","Israeli, Jewish and pro-Israel groups all applauded the publication of an ‘unprecedented’ United Nations report on anti-Semitism, that, among other issues, links anti-Semitism to criticism of Israel and the BDS movement.

“This report marks one of the first times the U.N. has addressed the issue of anti-Semitism in any detail,” said Anne Herzberg, Legal Advisor and U.N. Liaison at NGO Monitor. “The Special Rapporteur condemned the use of anti-Semitic tropes and denial of Israel’s right to exist by BDS activists. Importantly, the Rapporteur also recommends the IHRA definition as a useful tool in combating anti-Semitism. Hopefully, U.N. bodies, particularly the Human Rights Council, will follow the Rapporteur’s lead by adopting IHRA and ending their promotion of anti-Semitic tropes and attacks on Israel’s legitimacy.”

The report, “Combatting Antisemitism to Eliminate Discrimination and Intolerance Based on Religion or Belief,” that was released by the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Ahmed Shaheed, defines anti-Semitism as a global phenomenon—not one largely confined to the United States and Europe—as has been the case in many previous U.N. reports. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the sources of anti-Semitism are varied, coming from the far right, from members of radical Islamist groups and from the political left.

The report identifies violence, discrimination and expressions of hostility motivated by Jew-hatred as a serious obstacle to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief. It expresses “serious concern that the frequency of anti-Semitic incidents appears to be increasing in magnitude and that the prevalence of anti-Semitic attitudes and the risk of violence against Jewish individuals and sites appears to be significant, including in countries with little or no Jewish population.”

Additionally, the report “notes claims that the objectives, activities and effects of the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement are fundamentally anti-Semitic.”

The report recommends that all U.N. member states adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of anti-Semitism. So far, 18 of them have done so.

“The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism can offer valuable guidance for identifying anti-Semitism in its various forms, and therefore encourages States to adopt it for use in education, awareness-raising, and for monitoring and responding to manifestations of anti-Semitism,” states the report.

Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, commented that “we welcome the release of this unprecedented report on the subject of anti-Semitism. The report reflects the organizational change towards Israel. The assertion that the BDS movement encourages anti-Semitism is an important U.N. statement. As I have said many times, anti-Semitism has no place in our society, and must be denounced everywhere and from every platform.”

“Thanks to Ahmed Shaheed’s methodical and determined leadership, the U.N. finally is recognizing the severity of this ages-old hatred against Jews, and offering constructive guidance to member states on how to combat anti-Semitism effectively in their own countries and globally,” said Felice Gaer, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights.

The World Jewish Congress also applauded the report’s release.

“We hope that this report serves as an eye-opener to the United Nations and its member states and that they finally take concrete action to stem the surge of anti-Semitism across the globe,” said World Jewish Congress president Ronald S. Lauder. “We are grateful to have been able to take part in the facilitation of this research to ensure that the very real concerns facing our communities on a daily basis were not only taken into consideration, but also addressed as areas deserving of serious and direct attention.”"

At the same time, Gantz told his party members that he would not abandon his promise to the voters not to let Netanyahu remain prime minister, indicating the political gridlock which has left Israel without a government for months could persist.

Netanyahu last week had the Yamina, Shas and UTJ parties sign an agreement with his own Likud party to negotiate as a group, after elections that saw the right-wing and religious parties fail to garner enough support to form a coalition on their own. Gantz and his center-left partners also fell short of the needed 61 seats.

The latest attack within the walled-off Green Zone, which hosts foreign embassies and Iraqi government buildings, comes amid heightened tensions between Baghdad’s two main allies, Tehran and Washington.

A foreign security source inside the Green Zone said two 100mm rockets hit close to the US embassy and a third fell into the Tigris River, which the embassy overlooks.

“One hit about three meters (10 feet) inside a gate on the embassy compound,” the source told AFP.

An Iraqi security source confirmed to AFP that two Katyusha rockets landed near the embassy shortly before midnight.

They were found to have been fired from an area in southern Baghdad where Iraqi paramilitary forces close to Iran hold sway.

The Iraqi military said two projectiles hit the edges of the Green Zone.

None of the sources mentioned any casualties and no group claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Foreign diplomatic sources within the zone said US embassy sirens wailed across the area twice, and stopped shortly before 1 a.m. local time on Tuesday morning.

The last rocket attack on the Green Zone took place on May 19, just days after the US announced an “ordered departure” of all non-essential diplomatic staff in Iraq.

After decades of back-to-back conflicts, Iraq has enjoyed a period of relative stability since declaring victory over the Islamic State jihadist group in late 2017.

In a sign of the improving security situation, Iraqi authorities have been working since last year to loosen security restrictions around the Green Zone.

Concrete blast walls have been removed and through-traffic has been allowed for the first time in over a decade, but the US embassy remains one of the most highly-secured area in the zone.

Baghdad has also tried to position itself as a potential mediator between the US and Iran, which have been at loggerheads since Washington unilaterally withdrew from the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran last year.

Since that move, tensions have spiraled between the two countries, with Iraq — where both countries enjoy significant political and military influence — caught in the middle.

The risk of a proxy war seemed particularly high this summer, when a string of mysterious blasts hit weapons depots and other bases used by pro-Iran paramilitary forces known as the Hashed al-Shaabi.

The Hashed blamed the US and Israel, with its political branch calling the attacks “a declaration of war” and resuming its calls for US troops to leave the country."

Rashida Tlaib’s grandmother is not a fan of America. The 90-year-old Muftia Tlaib made that much clear in an interview with USA Today.

She was quoted telling the newspaper:

“Even if I get an invitation from Trump to travel to the U.S., I won’t go,” she said. “Even if my husband returns from the grave and tells me to go, I refuse,” she said. “I don’t like it there,” she added. She said that she spent about 18 months in the U.S. when her granddaughter was in high school. “I decided not to ever go back after I made ‘Hadj'” – pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, prescribed as a religious duty for Muslims.

Tlaib along with fellow extremist Congresswoman Ilhan Omar were barred last by the Israeli government from entry into the country in keeping with a law that allows Israel from denying passage to supporters of the BDS movement seeking to destroy the Jewish state.

“We had planned to slaughter a sheep to celebrate her coming back to visit with us,” Tlaib’s uncle Bassam Tlaib told USA Today. “But we supported her decision. And we know why the Israelis didn’t want her here: Her visit would have shown how we Palestinians are suffering under their occupation,” he claimed.

Omar and Tlaib are both prominent BDS supporters who in July introduced a resolution in Congress aimed at supporting the BDS Movement, which targets the Middle East’s only democracy, seeks the end of Israel and is engaged in economic warfare against the Jewish state.

The cancelled visit was partially organized and co-sponsored by Miftah, an anti-Israel organization headed by notorious Palestinian extremist Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee and supporter of BDS.

NGO Monitor, a watchdog on extremist nonprofits, notes that Miftah has accused Israel of committing “massacres,” “apartheid,” “summary executions” of Palestinian youth and “Judaizing” Jerusalem. It has also accused Israel of “ethnic-cleansing of Palestinian-Israeli Arabs.”

Ashrawi was a political leader of the violent First Palestinian Intifada and served as deputy to late PLO leader and arch-terrorist Yasser Arafat. She is known for espousing anti-Israel conspiracy theories and attempting to justify Palestinian “resistance” against the Jewish state.

Netanyahu and Gantz both confirmed that they would attend the meeting, called for Monday evening. Shortly after Rivlin’s appeal, Netanyahu, speaking at a Likud party faction meeting at the Knesset, said that “the only government that can be formed is a broad unity government” between his Likud and the centrist Blue and White.

Netanyahu, who received 55 MK recommendations to Gantz’s 54, made his own plea for Gantz to agree to a meeting “to achieve unity and compromise between the national camp headed by me… and the left-wing camp headed by Gantz.” Gantz has so far rejected an invitation to meet with the prime minster “with no preconditions,” a call Netanyahu made immediately after signing an agreement according to which his Likud party and all the parties on the religious right agreed to only enter a coalition as a single unit and negotiate the terms of the new government together.

The conservative leader added the U.K. would consider taking part in a U.S.-led military effort to bolster the Gulf kingdom’s defenses, while Iran’s president announced plans for a rival Iranian-led security coalition.

Britain had previously held back from attributing blame for the drone and missile attack. Saudi Arabia and the United States say Iran supplied 18 drones and seven cruise missiles which hit an oil field and processing facility, something Tehran denies.

Iran warned the U.S. that any military response will spark an “all-out war” with immediate retaliation from Tehran.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence both condemned the attack on Saudi oil facilities as “an act of war.”

Speaking on board an RAF Voyager jet late Sunday on the way to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Johnson said, “the U.K. is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran” for the attack by drones and cruise missiles.

“We will be working with our American friends and our European friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region.”

Johnson confirmed he would meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at this week’s U.N. gathering. Johnson is also due to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.

He said he wanted Britain to be “a bridge between our European friends and the Americans when it comes to the crisis in the Gulf.”

If diplomacy eventually fails, Johnson has not ruled out a more aggresive response.

The Trump administration announced Friday that it would send additional U.S. troops and missile defense equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of a “defensive” deployment.

Officials said the number of troops was likely to be in the hundreds, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper telling Pentagon reporters this is a first step to beef up security and he would not rule out additional moves down the road.

“We will be following that very closely,” Johnson said. “And clearly if we are asked, either by the Saudis or by the Americans, to have a role, then we will consider in what way we could be useful. We will consider in what way we could be useful, if asked, depending on what the exact plan is.”

The detainees were dressed in identical athletic uniforms, and carried identical sports bags as well as two volleyballs, police said.

After questioning, police determined that the men were not a volleyball team. They detained them and sent them to an examining magistrate to face charges of trying to illegally enter the country using stolen or lost travel documents.

The men were planning to travel to Switzerland and claim asylum, police said.

The report did not cite reasons for the move, but came just hours after Syrian state media reported the downing of an explosives-lade drone in the Mount Hermon region.

Tanks, vehicles, troops, ammunition and arms were sent to the towns of Jamlah and Aabdyn near the Syria-Israel border, according to SOHR, which claimed earlier this month that Lebanese Shi’ite terrorist group Hezbollah is attempting to wrest control of the Quneitra area from anti-Assad rebels.

The human-rights group reported a “continuous state of lawlessness” in the area, which has suffered multiple attacks on pro-Iranian and pro-Syrian regime officials and media in recent months.

On Saturday, Syrian state media reported the downing of an explosives-laden drone in the Quneitra area, a few miles from the Israeli border.

While Syrian authorities insinuated that the drone came from Israel, Israel Defense Forces’ Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee claimed that the aircraft belonged to Iran, noting that it had come down in the same place from which Iranian-backed forces attempted to launch a drone into Israel in August.

“What is certain is that this is not an IDF drone,” wrote Adraee on Twitter.

Russian aviation site Avia.pro also reported that the downed drone was Israeli, and claimed that it was believed to have been neutralized by Russian forces.

According to Syrian media, Syrian military officials reported that cluster bombs and C4 explosive were affixed to the drone, which was set to detonate if someone tried to dismantle it."

In his remarks, Liberman — whose party won eight seats in last week’s election — said he could recommend for the task of forming the next coalition neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Blue and White’s Benny Gantz, who could receive the endorsement of the predominantly Arab Joint List.

“In the Knesset there is a party that is trying to destroy us from within, and in the best case scenario, they belong in parliament in Ramallah, not in Israel,” said Liberman, referring to the Joint List. “Therefore we cannot recommend Benny Gantz. Therefore our recommendation to the president is that we won’t recommend anyone.”

Cardin: Trump ‘Isolated America Rather Than Iran’ When He Withdrew from Iran Nuclear Deal,"Sunday on MSNBC’s “Kasie DC,” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) criticized President Donald Trump for withdrawing the United States from the Iran Nuclear Agreement.

Cardin argued that by withdrawing, Trump “isolated America rather than Iran.”

“Let’s be clear: The circumstances between Iran and the United States could not be more dangerous,” Cardin warned. “There is a very clear chance there could be a miscalculation by either the United States or Iran. And if that leads to military action, that’s not in our national security interest.”

“The problem is when the president withdrew from the nuclear agreement, he isolated America rather than Iran,” he added. “Iran’s the bad guy, but we’ve been isolated diplomatically because of the president’s action of withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Agreement.”

Partial transcript as follows:

MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States is not required to defend Saudi Arabia in the wake of this attack, but does the U.S. look weak if it doesn’t militarily respond?

KERRY: Not if we do other things that show strength and confidence in a genuine strategy and policy, and that’s what’s really lacking here I think. You’ve got to- you’ve got to go back to the beginning here. We had an agreement. We have an agreement, that the rest of the world supports–

BRENNAN: The nuclear deal.

KERRY: –the nuclear agreement. And I heard Secretary Pompeo say well we want to get into a place where we know they can’t have a nuclear weapon. Well we’re there. We were there. And France, Germany, Britain, China, Russia, all still support a multilateral agreement that was a model of multilateral diplomacy. We came together, the world welcomed this, the United Nations security council ratified it, embraced it. And that still is there. Along comes President Trump and he pulls out. He broke the agreement.

BRENNAN: You think pulling out–

KERRY: He is the one well- what–

BRENNAN: –caused this escalation?

KERRY: The escalation is the absolutely foreseeable and it was foreseen that this is what would happen. Why do I say that? Because we were ridiculed for saying that the alternative to what we were trying to do in making the agreement was war, was conflict. I mean I- I personally had leaders in the Middle East telling me you’ve got to bomb Iran. We had a prime minister of Israel come to America and ask for a green light to bomb. So, we were averting war. And when we signed the agreement in- in Vienna, the initial agreement, we all agreed that this was a way to avoid a war and open up a channel of communicating, and diplomacy to be able to deal with legitimate other issues that are concerned with Iran. We’re concerned about their support for Hezbollah. We’re concerned about their missiles. We’re concerned about Yemen. We’re concerned about interference in other countries. But what is the best way to deal with that, Margaret? That’s the question–

BRENNAN: But can the nuclear deal be salvaged now–

KERRY: –and by breaking this–

BRENNAN: given that Iran is already starting—

KERRY: Of course, of course it could be salvaged.

BRENNAN: –to push the limits and cheat here?

KERRY: Well, they- I think-

BRENNAN: And there are sunset clauses.

KERRY: Yes they are. Look, I think and- and you’ve got to be really clear and honest about what’s happening here. I believe Iran, one way or the other, was behind the attack that took place. That to me is obvious. And it’s also obvious that it’s got to be denied. And it will be denied right now because they need the plausible deniability. But the president I think is absolutely is actually correct to be evaluating sort of not being rushed into a corner to go to war. That is what we shouldn’t do. But you’ve also got to look at what happened afterwards, after we pulled out. We basically declared economic war—

BRENNAN: Right.

KERRY: –on Iran. We have been pressuring them. Maximum pressure. And it was entirely foreseeable that that would result in further conflict. So we’re seeing the unfolding of really a bankruptcy of approach.

BRENNAN: Okay.

KERRY: The international community can come together now. I think there is a way to avert war —

BRENNAN: And that’s going to be one of the pushes this week–

KERRY: –without showing weakness."

ZARIF: These attacks did not take place from Iran for the supreme leader to approve them. Had they taken place from Iran then he would have had to approve them. But it didn’t take place from Iran.

BRENNAN: Do you think U.S. officials are lying when they say that? That Saudi Arabia is lying?

ZARIF: I’m certainly- I’m certain that they’re being lied to, whether they want to accept that lie. I think the work of us diplomats- I think myself and my counterpart, the U.S. secretary of state, we need to try to push diplomacy, as Senator Sanders has recently said, not to push war.

BRENNAN: Are you confident that you can avoid a war?

ZARIF: No. No, I’m not confident that we can avoid a war. We- I’m confident that we will not start one but I’m confident that whoever starts one will not be the one who finishes it.

BRENNAN: What does that mean?

ZARIF: That means that there won’t be a limited war."

The Rafah Zoo in the southern Gaza Strip was known for its emaciated animals, with the owners saying they struggled to find enough money to feed them.

In April, international animal rights charity Four Paws took all the animals to sanctuaries, receiving a pledge the zoo would close forever.

But last month it reopened with two lions and three new cubs, penned in cages only a few square metres in size.

Critics say the owners want to bully Four Paws or other animal welfare organisations into giving them thousands of dollars to free the animals into their care.

Four Paws paid the zoo’s owners more than $50,000 in the year before its closure for medical treatments, food and caretakers.

The zoo’s owner insists the reopening is solely for the enjoyment of local residents.

– 1,000 metres, not seven –

When AFP visited the zoo recently, the badly stuffed corpse of a lion was displayed near the entrance.

An ostrich in a three-metre-square pen pecked endlessly at the cage’s bars, while two monkeys sat chewing on litter.

At the far end the lion and lioness were kept in separate cages, each only a few square metres.

The owners were seeking to remove the cubs from their mother to play with visiting children.

To do so they hit the lioness with sticks and banged on the cage to confuse her, with staff later taunting her when the cubs had been taken out.

“A lion needs 1,000 square metres to play in. Here they have seven square metres,” Mohammed Aweda, a prominent animal enthusiast in Gaza, told AFP.

“The zoo won’t survive during the winter, because they are lacking in daily goods which cost a lot. For you or I or anyone who owns a zoo (in Gaza), the economy is very tough.”

Palestinian Gaza is run by Islamist movement Hamas.

The enclave of two million people had negative eight percent economic growth last year.

Around two-thirds of young people are unemployed, while nearly 50 percent are below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. Many Palestinians are desperate for ways to make money.

Amid international outcry over conditions at the zoo, last year Four Paws reached an agreement with the owners.

In April nearly 50 animals, including lions, monkeys, peacocks and porcupines, were taken out of Gaza through Israeli territory to sanctuaries in Jordan and elsewhere.

The NGO said in a statement it explicitly does not pay for animals but provided funding for “costs for medical treatments, food and caretakers so that the over 40 animals were strong and healthy enough for the rescue and transfer.”

In total the amount paid over a year was $55,000, the NGO said.

Four Paws said the zoo’s owner promised not to reopen.

Critics suspect the owners of seeking to bully Four Paws into paying again.

“Any international organisation won’t deal with this issue easily because it has become trade,” Aweda said.

– ‘Entertainment’ –

The newly reopened zoo’s manager Ashraf Jumaa, from the same family that owned the old one, said they brought the new lions through tunnels from Egypt.

The newly reopened zoo’s manager Ashraf Jumaa, from the same family that owned the old one, said they brought the new lions through tunnels from Egypt.

However others suggested they were bought from another animal centre in northern Gaza.

He denied they wanted to blackmail Four Paws.

“The first goal is entertainment, not trade. The main reason we reopened the zoo was people in the area that supported us,” he said.

He said it would be less expensive because there were fewer animals, but admitted they would struggle to afford enough food once the cubs were fully grown.

“Every day they will need between 22 and 30 kilos of meat costing between 100 and 150 shekels (between $28 and $43),” he said.

They currently receive around 50 visitors a day, he said, with tickets on average costing two shekels (around $0.50).

Four Paws said footage it saw from the zoo was “very concerning”.

“The animals are not kept in species-appropriate conditions. They seem to be in bad conditions and urgently need medical attention and proper food,” it said.

An official from the Gaza agriculture ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there had been no coordination regarding the zoo’s reopening.

He said Gaza needed a large park meeting international standards."

Police said a 65-year-old suspect in the hijacking was arrested Thursday on the island of Mykonos in response to a warrant from Germany.

Lt. Col. Theodoros Chronopoulos, a police spokesman, told The Associated Press that the hijacking case involved TWA Flight 847. The flight was commandeered by hijackers shortly after taking off from Athens on June 14, 1985. It originated in Cairo and had San Diego set as a final destination, with stops scheduled in Athens, Rome, Boston and Los Angeles.

The hijackers shot and killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem, 23, after beating him unconscious. They released the other 146 passengers and crew members on the plane during an ordeal that included stops in Beirut and Algiers. The last hostage was freed after 17 days.

The suspect was in custody Saturday on the Greek island of Syros but was set to be transferred to the Korydallos high security prison in Athens for extradition proceedings, a police spokeswoman told The Associated Press. She said the suspect was a Lebanese citizen. The spokeswoman spoke on condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing.

Police refused to release the suspect’s name.

In Beirut, the Foreign Ministry said the man detained in Greece is a Lebanese journalist called Mohammed Saleh, and that a Lebanese embassy official planned to try to visit him on Sunday.

However, several Greek media outlets identified the detainee as Mohammed Ali Hammadi, who was arrested in Frankfurt in 1987 and convicted in Germany for the plane hijacking and Stethem’s slaying. Hammadi, an alleged Hezbollah member, was sentenced to life in prison but was paroled in 2005 and returned to Lebanon.

Germany had resisted pressure to extradite him to the United States after Hezbollah abducted two German citizens in Beirut and threatened to kill them.

Hammadi, along with fellow hijacker Hasan Izz-Al-Din and accomplice Ali Atwa, remains on the FBI’s list of most wanted terrorists. The FBI offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to each man’s capture.

News agency dpa reported Saturday that Germany’s federal prosecutor’s office declined to comment on news reports about the case."

A heavy security presence was also maintained in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, the epicentre of Egypt’s 2011 revolution, after protests in several cities called for the removal of general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Such demonstrations are rare after Egypt effectively banned protests under a law passed following the 2013 military ouster of Islamist ex-president Mohamed Morsi.

But discontent over rising prices has been swelling in Egypt, where Sisi’s government has imposed strict austerity measures since 2016 as part of a $12-billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund.

Nearly one in three Egyptians live below the poverty line on less than $1.40 a day, according to official figures released in July.

On Saturday, protesters headed to downtown Suez for the second night in a row, where they were met by security forces barricading the streets and armoured vehicles.

“There were about 200 or so people. They (security forces) fired tear gas, rubber and live bullets and there were injuries,” a man who took part in the demonstration but declined to be named told AFP.

Another resident, who also preferred to remain anonymous, said the tear gas was so thick it had reached her apartment block a few kilometres away from the turbulent downtown area.

“My nose started burning up. The smell was seeping through the balcony. I also saw some youth run and hide in our street,” the woman said.

On late Friday, hundreds of Egyptians poured through the streets of Cairo, chanting slogans including “Leave, Sisi!” and demanding the “fall of the regime”.

At least 74 people were arrested after clashes between the crowds and police in the capital, a security source told AFP.

The protests came after Mohamed Aly, an exiled businessman and opponent of Sisi posted calls online for demonstrations against Sisi.

He upped the pressure on Saturday in an expletive-filled video, imploring Egyptians to join a “million-man march” next Friday and to fill all “major squares” of the country.

“This is a people’s revolution… We have to link up together as one… and organise going down to the major squares,” he said in a Facebook appeal to his followers.

The construction contractor has been posting videos that have gone viral since early September, accusing Sisi and the military of rampant corruption.

‘Leave’

The president denied the allegations last week, saying he was “honest and faithful” to his people and the military.

But on Friday demonstrators took to the streets in Cairo after a highly-charged football match between local powerhouses Al Ahly and Zamalek.

“I think it’s safe to say that the events of the past few weeks, including the development last night, pose the most serious legitimacy crisis facing Sisi,” Nael Shama, a Cairo-based political analyst, told AFP.

“No one shouted bread, freedom, social justice like in 2011, they escalated straight to ‘Leave’ from the first minute,” Shama noted.

On social media thousands shared footage of Friday’s demonstrations, which sprang up in several cities, including sizeable crowds blocking traffic in Alexandria, Al-Mahalla, Damietta, Mansoura and Suez.

“This is the first time people take to the streets in many years but I am not sure it will be the last,” Shama added.

Under Sisi’s rule, authorities have launched a broad crackdown on dissidents, jailing thousands of Islamists as well as secular activists and popular bloggers.

Sisi has regularly invoked security and stability as hallmarks of his reign in contrast to regional hotspots such as Libya and Syria.

‘Ball in government court’

The government’s foreign media accreditation body released a statement late Saturday cautioning international journalists that their reporting of events “should not be exaggerated”, without explicitly mentioning the protests.

On television Friday night, boisterous pro-Sisi host Amr Adib lambasted Aly, the businessman, showing footage of him allegedly in a drunken stupor.

Adib urged his fellow countrymen to “take care of the country… because the Muslim Brotherhood want to raze it to the ground”.

The Islamist group, once considered one of Egypt’s most organised political forces, was outlawed as a terror group in 2013 after Morsi’s overthrow.

Sisi is in New York where he is scheduled to address the UN General Assembly next week. His office did not comment on the protests, when asked by AFP on Saturday.

“Now the ball is in the government’s court,” said Shama, the analyst. “They have to respond somehow.”"

Salami offered no evidence to back his claim of the so-called “hidden” powers of military persuasion.

Salami spoke at Tehran’s Islamic Revolution and Holy Defence museum during the unveiling of an exhibition of what Iran says are U.S. and other drones captured in its territory.

According to the domestic Fars News, Salami said enemies of his country are unaware of secret capabilities of Iran, adding Tehran has significantly enhanced its military power to create threats and problems unknown and unexpected for anyone who opposes it.

“Our enemies must know that we have increased our capability of creating unknown threats. We have not yet disclosed our main sources of power and what they have seen and we have used so far is a small part of our capacities,” the major general said.

The commander added that Iran has changed the geography of its encounters with its enemies, underlining the Armed Forces of his country are ready for any scenario.

“As we have grown [and made progresses] within the mistakes in our enemies’ strategies and approaches, we are not afraid of them being repeated,” he asserted.

Also, on Saturday, IRGC’s aerospace commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh warned, “The enemy will receive a crushing response if it behaves badly.”

Hajizadeh boasted Iran is one of the world’s top five powers in drone development, making his remarks while visiting an exhibition General Salami had toured earlier where the IRGC showcased foreign drones.

Hajizadeh said Iran has the largest collection of downed drones and has put them in an exhibition “to give the enemies a lesson.”"

General Assembly on Wednesday emphasized environmental issues and maritime sovereignty, concluding with some criticism of climate activists for using children to accomplish their political objectives.

Morrison called on the United Nations, which will celebrate its 75th anniversary next year, to “reform and evolve to respond effectively to the challenges of the 21st century.”

He elaborated that what he really meant was the U.N. resisting pressures to abandon its core liberal democratic values and follow “the alternate path of lowest common denominator transactional relativism,” which he called a “dead end.”

“The U.N. is the prime custodian of the rules-based order,” he said. “The U.N. and its norms are central to a cooperative rules-based approach to global challenges.”

Morrison spoke at length about Australia’s approach to environmental issues, particularly oceanic issues and recycling, which he described as vitally important matters for a nation situated on what amounts to a very large island, with some 85 percent of its population concentrated on the coasts.

Some of Morrison’s talking points sounded more like a backhanded indictment of the United Nations than a celebration of its importance. For example, he spent several minutes discussing the menace of illegal fishing, which he described as an especially serious problem for small Pacific Island nations that are highly dependent on their fishing industries, and talking about how Australia is working to resolve the issue as a regional leader in partnership with countries like Indonesia. It did not sound like this was a problem anyone wanted to wait for the United Nations to identify and resolve.

“There are too many nations standing by while their nationals are thieving the livelihood of their neighbors,” Morrison said of illegal fishing. “Australia is acting not only in our own interests but helping our Pacific Island family to reduce illegal fishing.”

Although he did not challenge China directly in his speech, Morrison’s complaints about infringements against maritime sovereignty could certainly be taken as a jab at Beijing, which is the primary regional threat to such sovereignty. Chinese boats are among the worst perpetrators of illegal fishing activities, and they’re not always subtle about it.

After speaking at great length on environmental and climate issues, Morrison made what could be taken as a criticism of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg and, more directly, the adults who handle her. The relevant passage in his address on Wednesday closely paralleled comments he made Tuesday on Thunberg’s appearance at the U.N.

“We must respect and harness the passion and aspiration of our younger generations, and we must guard against others who would seek to compound or, worse, facelessly exploit their anxiety for other agendas,” he said.

“We must similarly not allow their concerns to be dismissed or diminished, as this can also needlessly increase their anxiety,” he added. “What parent would do otherwise?”

“Our children have a right not just to their future, but to their optimism. Above all, we must let our children be children. Let our kids be kids. Let our teenagers be teenagers while we do the work positively together to deliver the practical solutions for them and their future,” he urged.

Morrison’s speech also chastised climate change activists for undervaluing Australia’s environmentalist actions, lamenting that critics “willingly overlook or ignore our achievements” because “the facts simply don’t fit the narrative they wish to project.”"

The Hong Kong Free Press reported that police were not pleased by efforts to monitor their activities in Mong Kok:

Ming Pao reported that a 13-year-old girl was among those detained. When an onlooker tried to ask her name, a police officer interjected and said that the onlooker was not a lawyer. As arrests were being made, some officers shone head-mounted strobe lights at reporters trying to record the scene.

The pace of protest marches is not slowing down, reflecting the determination of protesters to have all five of their core demands met, not just permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill that sparked the current political crisis:

Though the bill has been withdrawn, demonstrators are demanding a fully independent probe into police behavior, amnesty for those arrested, universal suffrage and a halt to the characterization of protests as “riots.” More protests have been planned throughout the week, including a rally at 8pm on Friday at Chater Garden in Central against alleged police brutality at the San Uk Ling Holding Centre. Meanwhile, an “anti-Chinazi” march will be held on Sunday at 2:30pm – protesters plan to march from Sogo department store in Causeway Bay to government headquarters in Admiralty. The organizers have said they will not seek police approval.

A good deal of emphasis in the protests is moving to police brutality and the need for a proper investigation, not just an internal review that would be dismissed as a whitewash.

Elderly protester Chan Ki-kau, part of a group of “grandpas” that tries to protect young demonstrators from harm, said in a radio interview on Wednesday that he was pepper-sprayed and shoved to the ground without warning on Saturday night merely because he asked the name of a young demonstrator arrested by the police.

“Nowadays the police would use false pretenses, and protect those officers who knowingly break the law,” Chan said.

Chan added that he was not the old man in a yellow vest who was dragged into an alley and kicked by police officers in a viral video from the weekend, but said the man was another member of his Protect Our Kids Campaign.

The South China Morning Post on Wednesday reported Chinese authorities appear to have convinced themselves the true cause of the uprising is expensive Hong Kong real estate, which causes young people to feel nervous about their futures even though the semi-autonomous city has extremely low unemployment rates.

Some of the protesters do complain about unaffordable housing, and occasionally blame it on Chinese real estate speculators as well as local development cabals, but the notion of dissipating political unrest with housing subsidies did not have many takers.

The SCMP’s interviews with young protesters suggested resentment against the Beijing-controlled government of Hong Kong was much deeper than previously understood and the extradition bill served to focus that resentment into mass political action. The youth of Hong Kong was said to have grown increasingly demoralized as Chinese domination loomed and their unique civic identity slipped away.

“Without genuine, universal suffrage, we won’t get a leader who will really carry out policies that benefit the people. Problems such as high property prices will only persist,” said one protester who had good reason to complain about Hong Kong’s lousy housing market, having spent her entire 32 years on Earth in a 300-square-foot apartment with her parents.

All of the protesters interviewed by the SCMP described universal suffrage and true representative democracy as the key demand of the movement because all other promises could easily be broken in the future by the current undemocratic system.

Former U.S. ambassador to Singapore Kirk Wagar told CNBC on Wednesday that Beijing has “no good options in Hong Kong” because Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping long ago made an unwise decision to deliberately “devalue” the city to “teach a lesson to the rest of China.”

Wagar expressed pleasant surprise that China has not cracked down on the Hong Kong protest movement yet, but saw little chance that the remaining four core demands of the protesters will be met, especially that all-important call for universal suffrage."

“No disrespect to the judiciary”, he began – using the time-honoured formula he will have learned from his teenage children, meaning “Maximum disrespect, actually, you scum-sucking losers” – “That court decision was wrong.”

His prorogation of parliament, Boris went on to insist, was essentially a political event – and therefore one which ought to be beyond the jurisdiction of the judiciary.

He certainly wasn’t going to apologise – as, of course, all those on the Remain side of the argument have been urging him to do.

Rather, he was going to come back at his critics, all guns blazing.

PM Bojo Throws Down the Gauntlet to Remainers: Challenge me in an Election or I'll Deliver Brexit https://t.co/fi9CdLuBdc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019

His strategy is clear. Boris is going to drape himself in the mantle of the British people who, he will continually – and not unreasonably – argue have been betrayed by a remote, shadowy elite. The Supreme Court — a creation of constitutional wrecker Tony Blair, stuffed with politically correct, Europhile placemen and placewomen — is very much part of that problem.

He thundered:

“This parliament does not want Brexit to happen at all.”

and

“The people of this country can see very clearly what is going on”.

Johnson laid into the “Surrender Act” — his description of the bill, introduced by Hilary Benn and ratified in record time by Remain-dominated parliament with the connivance of the Remainer Speaker John Bercow.

He accused his Remainer opponents in the House of “living in a fantasy world” in which they imagined that they could cancel the result of the first EU referendum, legislate for a second referendum, and that this time the public would vote for Remain and parliament would honour it.

He lambasted them for they way they had continually, through “ever more elaborate manoeuvres”, thumbed their noses at the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit.

To jeers from the Labour and SNP benches, he taunted Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn again and again for his failure to propose the No Confidence motion which would lead to a general election – not out of principle but “to avoid facing the electorate” in an election which Corbyn would certainly lose.

This was not the speech of a Prime Minister on the back foot – much as that is how the mainstream media, the BBC especially, would love to present him.

“We will not betray the people who sent us here,” Boris said — meaning the voters.

Members of the House of Commons were challenged to bring the government down if they disagreed with its determination to deliver Brexit as promised Wednesday night, with the PM — freshly returned from the United Nations in New York after the UK Supreme Court ruled against his government — saying that such a vote could be brought as soon as tomorrow, Thursday.

Sky News reported Downing Street sources even as the Prime Minister spoke that if the opposition declined to bring the government down — as it could easily do if it chose to — then the government would assume Parliament had faith in the government’s plan to leave the European Union “do or die” at the end of October and push on in that direction. Extraordinarily, it also reported the Prime Minister would not rule out a second prorogation if necessary.

In the chamber, the Prime Minister repeatedly challenged the opposition to go to the country at large, and to test their respective positions in the court of public opinion, calling out “come on!” at members as they jeered in response.

‘They Are Too Cowardly!’: Anti-Brexit MPs Taunted in House For Refusing General Election https://t.co/SUFtZg42FR — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019

Laying the blame for the United Kingdom having not left the European Union yet solely at the feet of the anti-Brexit majority in Parliament, Mr Johnson said: “three years ago more people voted to leave the European Union than had ever voted for any party or proposition in our nation’s history. Politicians of all parties promised they would honour the result. Sadly, many have since done all they could to abandon those promises and to overturn that democratic vote… The truth is the majority opposite are not opposed to no deal, they don’t want Brexit to happen at all.”

Following comments by his colleague the Attorney General earlier in the day that politicians who had rejected a general election to clear out the parliamentary blockage preventing any progress on the matter of Brexit were “cowardly” and members of a “dead Parliament”, the Prime Minister said anti-Brexiteers had “turned tail and fled” from the British people.

He said: “It is not just that this parliament is gridlocked, paralysed, and refusing to deliver on the priorities of the people. It is not just unable to move forward, it is worse than that. Out of sheer selfishness and political cowardice, members opposite are unwilling to move aside and give the people a say. They see MPs demanding that the people should be given a say one week and then running away from an election that would provide the people with a say the next.

“…[is Jeremy Corbyn] going to dodge a vote of no confidence in me as Prime Minister, in order to escape the verdict of the voters?… Will they have the courage to act or will they refuse to take responsibility and dither and delay. Why wouldn’t they, what are they afraid of?”

Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the Prime Minister’s speech as “ten minutes of bluster” and called on him to resign.

The Prime Minister has already given the house two opportunities to approve a general election, both of which it has rejected — a first in British political history, where it is generally assumed the opposition would always wish to fight a general election to replace the government with themselves.

A ComRes poll has found that the point spread between the four largest parties is narrowing, with the Conservatives and Labour jointly on 27 per cent, the pro-EU Liberal Democrats on 20 per cent, and the Brexit Party on 17 per cent, having gained four points since the last survey.

With the Brexit Party again rising in the polls in the wake of the Conservative government losing a Supreme Court case on proroguing parliament and Labour turning its back on its Brexit supporters, a separate poll found that more Leave voters are looking to Nigel Farage for guidance on voting.

Data from ComRes commissioned by Britain Elects suggested that Brexiteers may employ tactical voting at the next General Election, with 43 per cent of those polled saying they were more likely to vote for a Leave-supporting Conservative candidate if Nigel Farage endorsed them compared to just 11 per cent who said they would be less likely.

Notably, nearly one-third, 28 per cent, of Labour Leavers would be “more likely” to vote for a Leaver Tory in their constituency if Nigel Farage endorsed them.

A majority, 60 per cent, of Leave voters also said they would “vote for the party in favour of Brexit that had the best chance of winning” if the party they traditionally vote for did not have a chance of winning in their constituency.

Labour Leavers Switching to #Brexit Party, Not Tories; ERG Urge Boris to Agree Election Pact https://t.co/HtfjM2kZxJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 14, 2019

On the issue of a non-aggression pact, where the Conservatives and Brexit Party would agree to the tactical standing of candidates so as not to split the Leave-supporting vote, 57 per cent of 2016 Leave voters agree a pact is the best chance for Brexit to happen, with 63 per cent of Tory voters and 79 per cent Brexit Party supporters agreeing.

Founder of Britain Elects, Ben Walker, said: “The data we have commissioned offers further evidence to the fact British politics is experiencing a realignment where a number of Labour Leave voters are considering voting Conservative in order to see a Brexit supporting candidate win.

“What the data also shows is that Nigel Farage, once the stepping stone for sending former Labour voters gone UKIP over to the Conservatives, has sizeable influence in pushing Leave voters in a certain direction.

“This, and the willingness for a pact from both current Conservative and Brexit Party voters is significant insofar as it suggests the Leave vote could be less likely to fragment between the two parties in a constituency than we previously thought.”

Mr Farage’s frequent calls for an election pact have been rejected, however, with a spokesman for Boris Johnson’s team saying he was not a “fit and proper” person to be allowed near government, the prime minister later promising he would not sign a pact with the Brexit Party.

Farage wrote on Tuesday night that Johnson had made a “huge mistake” in turning down the pact, saying such a deal he “was a logical and winning formula which would have guaranteed killing two birds with one stone: delivering a clean break Brexit; and smashing the undemocratic Lib Dems and increasingly dangerous Labour Party. Yet he has turned up his nose at this opportunity. I think he has made a huge mistake.”"

The Munk debate, which was originally scheduled for September 28th, was set to take place in Toronto, with the leaders of the three main opposition parties, the Conservatives, the leftist New Democrats (NDP), and the Green party, all agreeing to attend, CBC reports.

Rudyard Griffiths, who chairs the Munk Debates, expressed regret over the prime minister’s refusal to attend the debate saying: “the prime minister’s refusal to attend our debate has denied Canadians the only real opportunity they had this election to see his foreign policy record challenged in a substantive and sustained fashion.”

This is not the first debate Trudeau has walked out on in this election campaign. A debate hosted by the magazine Macleans and broadcaster CityTV was held without him earlier this month, with Mr Trudeau’s podium standing empty on stage during the event.

All three opposition party leaders attacked Trudeau during the debate with NDP leader Jagmeet Singh commenting: “Mr Trudeau hasn’t shown up for people for four years and he hasn’t shown up today for the people.”

“I think I’ve found some consensus. I think we can all agree Justin Trudeau is afraid of his record,” Tory leader Andrew Scheer said.

The Macleans debate occurred shortly before the massive blackface scandal that has rocked Trudeau and the Liberal Party he leads.

What started as a single image of Trudeau in blackface at an “Arabian Nights” party, turned into a scandal as more images of the Canadian leader in blackface emerged.

Last week, Trudeau claimed that he did not even recall how many times he may have darkened his skin, stating that he had forgotten about one of the three incidents revealed over the course of the week.

Polling released following the breaking of the blackface scandal has revealed a dip for the Liberals, with the Tories now slightly in the lead."

Speaking at the launch of the Vegan Now campaign, Michael Mansfield QC said in comments reported by The Telegraph: “I think when we look at the damage eating meat is doing to the planet it is not preposterous to think that one day it will become illegal.”

The concept may seem absurd, but the Nanny State in Britain has already introduced a ‘sugar tax’ on soft drinks and Public Health England’s draft guidelines tell restaurants and supermarkets to shrink the size of pizzas due to rising obesity. The UK has already become a hostile environment to smokers, with smoking banned inside public places, including pubs and restaurants, and work places.

While these related to forcing changes of Britons’ lifestyle for the purpose of improving health, Mr Mansfield’s suggestion stems from a perceived need to safeguard the health of the planet. Referencing the smoking ban, the lawyer continued: “There are plenty of things that were once commonplace that are now illegal such as smoking inside.

“We know that the top 3,000 companies in the world are responsible for more than £1.5 trillion worth of damage to the environment with meat and dairy production high on the list.

“It is time for a new law on ecocide to go alongside genocide and the other crimes against humanity.”

The vegetarian added that he wanted to “make ecocide an international crime” and blamed the United States and United Kingdom for blocking ‘ecocide’ being included as under the remit of the International Criminal Court.

An Oxford University study last year urged the government to impose a red meat tax — one enthusiastically backed by the Green party — while in Germany, legislators propose raising taxes on meat to 19 per cent to fight alleged man-made climate change.

Meat bans have been imposed on local scales to ‘fight’ climate change, with the London University’s leftist Goldsmith’s College having banned all beef products from its campus.

Vegetarianism and veganism are on the rise in the UK, with those who refrain from eating meat — or all animal products including eggs, milk, and cheese in the case of vegans — wanting their lifestyle choices to be recognised as a ‘protected characteristic’ in law, shielding them from discrimination in the same way a minority is protected from discrimination on grounds of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.

In June, lawyer Alex Monaco said that vegans should be exempt from the great British tradition of the Work Tea Round because it is discriminatory to ask them to handle milk."

Abascal, who recently attended an event in Italy held by the national-conservative Brothers of Italy (FdI) alongside guests such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, said that he believed Brussels had pushed to get rid of Salvini to keep cheap migrant labour flowing into Europe, Il Giornale reports.

“Spain and Italy have common borders and the Spanish and Italians share the concern to protect their borders from the migratory invasions caused by European oligarchies flooding our countries with cheap labour,” Abascal said.

“It is clear that Minister Salvini was the victim of what he had denounced for 18 months, that Italians are less and less the masters of their destiny, which once again was decided between Brussels and Strasbourg,” he added.

“I find it particularly shameful that for this operation against Italian sovereignty, a boat with the Spanish flag, the Open Arms, was used. And for this I apologised to Italy in the name of all the Spaniards from the Chamber of Deputies,” he said.

Hungarian Minister: With Salvini Europe Was Safe https://t.co/eIwJ0tBU2X — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 20, 2019

Salvini, who was still interior minister at the time, had told the Spanish NGO it could not dock at an Italian port in August, telling the vessel to go to Spain instead. Despite this, over 80 migrants were brought into Italian territory only days later.

Following the failed negotiations to form a working coalition government, Spain once again faces a new election in November.

Abascal commented on the prospects for VOX saying: “I am convinced that in the upcoming general elections on November 10th, Vox will consolidate its presence in the Spanish parliament, where we have proven to be the only alternative to progressive policies imposed by the left and approved of by the right.”

Noting VOX’s 50,000 person membership, Abascal said there was little to differentiate the main establishment parties in Spain saying they had become “increasingly difficult to differentiate, so it would be perfectly understandable if they ran together in the elections”."

General Assembly on Wednesday stressed the heavy toll of warfare upon nations around the world, including his own nation’s conflict with Russian-backed separatists.

He notably avoided mentioning the telephone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump that has become the center of the Democrat Party’s long-delayed push for impeachment, or the dealings his predecessors had with the family of former Vice President Joe Biden.

Given the overall theme of his address – a plea for world attention on Ukraine’s plight, a reminder that devastating large conflicts tend to begin after smaller problems are unwisely ignored for too long – Zelensky would doubtless be crestfallen to learn U.S. media completely lost interest in his U.N. appearance once it became clear he would not mention Trump.

Zelensky asserted the crisis in Ukraine’s Donbas region is precisely the sort of conflict the United Nations was created to avoid. He warned other nations that they ignore or indulge Russia’s actions in Donbas at their peril.

“Nobody will feel safe while Russia is waging war against Ukraine in the center of Europe. The thought this has nothing to do with you or will never touch your interests will be fatal,” he warned the General Assembly.

“Ending the war, recovering all occupied Ukrainian territories, and restoring peace are my primary objectives, but not at the cost of the lives of our citizens, freedom, or the right of Ukraine to make its own choice,” Zelensky said. “That is why we need wide international support.”

“I do realize every country present here has its own challenges to tackle, and the problems of others should not worry you more than your own,” he added. “But I understand that in the modern world where we live, there is no longer any such thing as ‘somebody else’s war … We cannot think globally while turning a blind eye to small things.”

“Ukraine has always demonstrated to the world its readiness to ensure peace in a civilized manner,” he argued. “We made particular steps towards international security – for example, when we abandoned our nuclear arsenal, which at that time exceeded the nuclear capacities of the United Kingdom, France, and China combined.”

“We believe in a collective drive to build a new world – a world where your thoughts are heard, and reckoned with, regardless of whether you possess nuclear weapons or not, a world where you are respected for your deeds and not for having nuclear warheads,” he said.

“At the end of the day, in this new world, my country has lost a part of its territory, and keeps losing its citizens almost every single day,” he noted ruefully.

Having thus shamed the U.N. for not doing enough to make up for the protection Ukraine sacrificed when it gave up its nuclear weapons, Zelensky hastened to assure the General Assembly that his country still has great faith in international institutions, “but we have to recognize that the existing system is not perfect.”

“Let’s be candid: Are the nations indeed united nowadays, and if they are, what makes them united?” he asked, suggesting the time has come for the U.N. to step up and put real effort into fulfilling the lofty promises routinely made from behind its podiums.

Zelensky said the bloody conflicts currently raging around the world, from Ukraine to hotspots like Yemen and Syria, offer depressing evidence that humans “still prefer to solve conflicts by murdering their own kind.”

A major goal of Zelensky’s speech was puncturing the notion that technological advances and global interconnectedness have made warfare obsolete. His address was peppered with grisly anecdotes that challenged the efficacy of the U.N. approach to conflict resolution.

To paraphrase part of Zelensky’s speech, the planet may have gotten smaller, but the wars really haven’t, and too many aggressive leaders have learned how to use the United Nations as a “political theater” where they “declare good intentions that will later be crossed out by the darkest acts.”

“In my opinion, we all need to understand that a strong leader is not one who, without the blink of an eye, sends thousands of troops to a sure death. A strong leader is the one who cares about the life of every person,” he said.

Zelensky said the U.N. should make every effort to keep aggressors from believing they can achieve their goals through violence, quoting Ernest Hemingway’s observation that “no one ever stopped when they were winning.”"

The Attorney General, who had been under considerable pressure to resign his position after the Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday dramatically turned the tables on the opposition Wednesday morning as repeated attempted blows from the benches failed to land.

As anti-Brexit members of the house lashed out at the government over perceived anti-democratic behaviour, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told the house that while they were “cowardly” for running from the British public for now, there would soon come a day when the “turkeys” would be no longer able to postpone Christmas.

BoJo Compares Endless Brexit Delay to Eternal Torture of Classical Myth in UN Speech https://t.co/LYmaa4I2Re — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019

Cox’s already famously loud and deep voice surged as he furiously reminded the house of the two opportunities it had been given to call a general election which were rejected, and the three opportunities to pass Theresa May’s Brexit deal, also rejected. These circumstances being the case, he said, the government was left with no choice but to plough on with a no-deal Brexit.

On Parliament’s refusal to give the British people a say on the type of Brexit to go going forward with via the ballot box, having a variety of parties with differing views on the way ahead to choose from, Mr Cox told the house it had surrendered its right to legitimacy.

Excoriating the house, Cox said: “This Parliament is a dead Parliament. It should no longer sit.

“It has no moral right to sit upon these green benches… while they block 17.4 million people’s votes, this Parliament is a disgrace.”

The Attorney General’s metaphor of members of parliament being Turkeys unwilling to vote for Christmas follows a report on the same lines by Breitbart London earlier this month, laying out the much-changed political landscape which means for the first time in British history, the opposition no longer wants a general election and with it the opportunity to form a government.

Because Parliament now has the ability to prevent the mortally wounded government from calling a general election and ending the impasse in the house, the anti-Brexit opposition is able to effectively govern from the shadows, passing anti-Brexit legislation without having to go through the formalities of actually being in power.

The government is reported to be preparing to call for a general election once again in the coming days, and likely as soon as tomorrow, Thursday. It remains unlikely Parliament will agree to the demand.

This year, the campaign begins during “the year of infanticide,” says its president and CEO Shawn Carney on the organization’s website.

We are in uncharted waters…https://t.co/lHNF2W7hIV — 40 Days for Life (@40daysforlife) September 20, 2019

“We are in uncharted waters,” he states. “The barbaric nature of abortion – and infanticide – is front and center right now in America. Many in Washington and the media are willing to leave a baby girl who survives an abortion on a table to die.”

Carney says, this year, 40 Days for Life will be held in 505 cities.

“Please pray for our nation as the world looks to see how America responds to the unprecedented attacks on our most innocent children,” he invites.

We will remain steadfast and determined in our mission to peacefully save lives and end abortion as we head into the largest 40 Days for Life campaign ever with more than 500 cities in 30 countries participating. https://t.co/DlzLrbToxt — 40 Days for Life (@40daysforlife) September 20, 2019

In Bristol, Tennessee, former Planned Parenthood manager and current 40 Days for Life director of outreach Sue Thayer is an upcoming speaker at Bridge Assembly of God, reports the Rogersville Review.

“40 Days for Life volunteers in the Tricities area have worked tirelessly for the cause of life,” Thayer said. “We know that prayers in front of an abortion facility save lives and change hearts. Around the world, we’ve seen expectant moms turn away from abortion facilities and choose life for their babies.”

Using herself as an example, Thayer added that abortion workers “are walking out of their jobs, and facilities are closing their doors forever.”

In College Station, Texas, people gathered Tuesday evening at Thomas Park for the kick-off of 40 Days for Life.

“We’re praying for an end to abortion,” said Patricia Hefti, organizer for the College Station event, reported the Eagle. “We’re praying for our community’s leaders, we’re praying for women and men who have been through abortions and need healing — we’re just praying.”

Hefti emphasized the 40 Days for Life campaign is peaceful, with all participants asking to sign a statement of peace and pledging to act “in a Christ-like manner at all times.”

“There is nothing mean or judgmental — anything like that,” she added. “It is the love of Christ for people that we want to see … save lives, and we want women to be empowered to be the moms that they can be or to give the child for adoption, but to give that child life.”

Jennifer Saucier shared the story of her decision to “choose life” with the College Station participants. She carried her pregnancy to term after rape in 2016, though she knew she could have an abortion, the Eagle reported.

Standing with her toddler, Saucier told the crowd, “I am why you guys do what you do.”

In Ireland, where voters decided last year to strike down the country’s Eighth Amendment banning abortion, Life Institute says in an email letter the first 40 Days for Life campaign is being held across the road from National Maternity Hospital in Dublin.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted in July his social media company banned a number of pro-life ads on the platform just ahead of the Irish abortion referendum.

Nevertheless, Life Institute reports the campaign organizers say, “Contrary to what secular media is claiming, 40 Days for Life is not a protest, it is a group of Christians gathering to pray to end abortion, which is happening in the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin.”

“We are praying because abortion is overwhelming, it ends the life of a human being and it causes a woman to think she has no other option than to pay a doctor to end the life of her child,” the pro-life campaign says."

Impossible? The modern-day Chinese have mastered Sun Tzu’s tactics with an unarmed assault on the United States.

No shots have been fired, no bombs dropped, no rockets launched, no boots on the ground, no declaration of war, yet the carnage by China’s stealth infiltration of America with its fatal fentanyl weapon is an undeclared war. This insidious poison, deployed with the impact of a nuclear missile strategically aimed at the heart of America, has mushroomed into a silent blitzkrieg of mounting American deaths. Its devastating power is causing nothing short of a generational meltdown.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, U.S. overdose deaths have soared to 21 percent over the previous year. More than 70,200 Americans died in 2017 from drug overdoses. The spike in deaths is attributed to the availability of fentanyl, as highlighted in a CBS report:

Two-thirds of last year’s drug deaths — about 42,000 — involved opioids, a category that includes heroin, methadone, prescription pain pills like OxyContin, and fentanyl. Fatal overdoses that involved fentanyl and fentanyl-like drugs doubled in one year, to more than 19,000, mostly from illegally made pills or powder, which is often mixed with heroin or other drugs.

As the victims of the infamous 19th-century Opium Wars, the Chinese people historically understand the devastation of a drug invasion upon a country and its military-age men. The 19th-century British invaded China and ravaged its people through the wide dissemination of opium. Opium helped the British gain economic superiority over its Chinese trading rival. The dark history of British oppression is embedded in the Chinese consciousness and still taught as “patriotic education” in its modern curriculum as a constant reminder of the “Century of Humiliation.”

Has America entered its own 21st century of humiliation?

China is manipulating its currency at a distinct disadvantage for American products.

China steals our intellectual property with impunity.

China has forced transfer of our technology with impunity.

China violates trade laws by dumping its cheap products to create a large U.S. trade imbalance.

China now wages its fentanyl war against the U.S., killing thousands of our young people with impunity.

Make no mistake, the Certificate of Origin for fentanyl trade is China. China manufactures and exports its fentanyl weapon system using a variety of fentanyl products, including raw fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and counterfeit prescription drugs like oxycodone that are laced with fentanyl. China’s ridiculously cheap ordnance packs 50 times more power than heroin.

This weapon of mass destruction, fentanyl, lobbed directly and covertly from our second-largest trading partner, China, is killing far more young people in one year than all Americans killed in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars combined.

In August, U.S. law enforcement conducted a fentanyl bust large enough to kill 14 million people. The fentanyl seized was made in Chinese labs, ordered from Shanghai and delivered to Virginia through the U.S. mail. Recently, CBS’ 60 Minutes featured a story on the increase of drug overdose deaths from fentanyl pouring into the United States. The 60 Minutes investigation found that:

It is a fact that the People’s Republic of China is the source for the vast majority of synthetic opioids that are flooding the streets of the United States and western democracies. It is a fact that these synthetic opioids are responsible for the overwhelming increase in overdose deaths in the United States. And it is a fact that if the People’s Republic of China wanted to shut down the synthetic opioid industry they could do so in a day.

China is bombarding America by manufacturing and exporting fentanyl to the U.S., not by means of a complex weapon system, but through the U.S. Postal Service, causing death and devastation. Additionally, Mexican cartels are now reaping the financial benefits by selling fentanyl derived from chemicals obtained from China. America’s porous border offers an easy pathway for the fentanyl delivery system.

While the volume of fentanyl law enforcement seizures is staggering, it represents only a small percentage of interdicted trade shipments of fentanyl. The vast majority of imported lethal fentanyl from China is never intercepted by law enforcement.

Undoubtedly, China’s high-tech surveillance state can easily and precisely pinpoint where and who manufactures fentanyl. Communist Party leader Xi Jinping can’t claim ignorance of China’s fentanyl criminal trade strategy. His vast internal CCP technological spy network knows the identity, work, and whereabouts of China’s 1.4 billion citizens. Xi can immediately call an armistice to this invasion. Xi and his CCP thugs can instantly turn off the Chinese fentanyl spigot, but they won’t until they feel the pain. His military campaign to destroy the U.S. from within has been wildly successful, and Xi hasn’t spent one yuan from his defense budget on this ongoing fentanyl skirmish on American soil.

According to Reuters, President Donald Trump accused Xi “of failing to meet his promises to crack down on the deluge of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs flowing into the United States. China labeled that ‘blatant slander.’”

China is waging an unrestricted non-military fentanyl war against America’s military-age young men.

Enough Chinese fentanyl is smuggled into the country to wipe out every American several times over. Yet, where is American outrage over China’s strategic lethal poisoning of our population? Where is the national outrage and repercussions over this Chinese-initiated fentanyl battlefield littered with the dead bodies of our youth?

Welcome to America’s century of humiliation. Sun Tzu would be proud.

General Assembly on Tuesday he is open to meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in person in an attempt to “normalize” relations between the two countries, strained by Japan’s brutal conquest of Korea in the 20th century and Pyongyang’s ceaseless belligerence since becoming a communist state.

Abe enthusiastically supported President Donald Trump’s approach to the North Korean problem of simply meeting Kim and attempting to reach a middle ground with minimal bureaucracy.

Trump’s approach has yielded three in-person meetings with Kim, the first time a North Korean dictator has met an American president. Kim has not tested a nuclear weapon since 2017 and diverted most of his country’s belligerence towards the United States over to Japan, instead, regularly “testing” short-range missiles in Japan’s direction.

On paper, Trump and Kim have only agreed to work towards “denuclearization,” but Washington and Pyongyang disagree on the definition of the word.

Abe spent most of his speech discussing women’s rights and economic opportunity.

“One of the country’s primary objectives is to harness the power of individuals one by one. To continue to do so is at the very essence of what Japan can contribute to the rest of the world,” Abe told the General Assembly, boasting of skyrocketing labor participation rates for women in his country, but omitting that, given strict misogynist traditions that limit women’s opportunities in Japan, that has been paired with a plummeting birth rate.

“If women were able to demonstrate the potential they hold, the world would sparkle that much more. But that is an obvious truth, isn’t it?” Abe asked. “In Japan, where the labor participation rate for women has seen a marked rise, we are witnessing that self-evident fact on a daily basis.”

Following an extensive story about Japanese citizens volunteering in Africa, Abe turned to the issue of North Korea.

“Japan supports the approach taken by President Trump, the approach by which the two leaders talk candidly with each other and try to work out the issues at hand while seeing a bright future ahead has changed the dynamics surrounding North Korea,” he told the audience. “I am determined to meet Chairman Kim Jong-un myself face to face without attaching any conditions.”

“Japan’s unchanging objective is to normalize its relations with North Korea through comprehensively resolving the outstanding issues of concern with North Korea – including the abductions, nuclear, and missile issues, as well as settling the unfortunate past.”

The Japanese government believes North Korea has abducted nearly 1,000 Japanese citizens, likely forcing them to teach North Korean spies the Japanese language and customs so they can blend in. North Korea has admitted that it kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens. Despite most of the instances being cases from the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese officials believe many of the individuals are still alive and have been indoctrinated, like the citizens of North Korea, to worship the Kim family.

Abe’s mention of “the unfortunate past” appears to be a reference to Japan’s occupation of Korea, in which Imperial Japan committed countless crimes against humanity against the Korean people. Among the most well-known is the use of sex slaves, or “comfort women,” who endured rape by Japanese soldiers on a regular basis as a form of morale-boosting during World War II.

Elsewhere in his speech, Abe noted the attack on one of Saudi Arabia’s top oil facilities this month, calling it an “extremely contemptible crime that holds the international economic order hostage,” and championed the use of “multilateral frameworks and globalism” to lift individuals out of poverty.

“The world does indeed change. We are able to change it through the efforts we make,” Abe concluded.

Abe first offered to meet Kim Jong-un without preconditions in May, following the collapse of talks between Kim and Trump in Vietnam. He said meeting personally could potentially “break the current mutual distrust.”

“I would like to meet him without setting preconditions and hold frank discussions. I hope he’s a leader who can determine flexibly and strategically what is best for his country,” Abe said at the time.

North Korea appears actively unprepared for such diplomatic discussion. As recently as this Tuesday, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) – North Korea’s official state propaganda outlet – was publishing stories condemning “Japanese imperialists” for World War II crimes.

“They cooked up the ‘Korea Mining Act’ in December 1915 in order to ensure their monopolistic and massive loot,” KCNA complained. “After provoking the war of aggression on the continent and the Pacific War, their moves to pillage underground resources became more desperate.”

“Japan should apologize and make reparation to the Korean people for all the crimes it committed in Korea in the last century,” KCNA insisted on Tuesday, making a demand that has become a nearly daily occurrence in state media.

KCNA also directly attacked Abe for his longtime desire to expand the role of the Japanese military. Japan technically does not have a military – only “self-defense forces” – as a concession to the world following World War II. Abe has argued that Japan has paid its debts from that war and is now a different country, one clearly responsible enough to have a military.

“[T]he island nation is working hard to turn itself into a military giant and realize the wild ambition for overseas expansion,” KCNA warned this week. “Japan’s desperate moves for constitutional revision are aimed to turn itself into a war state by setting up a legal and institutional mechanism for unleashing a war.”

North Korea’s foreign minister is expected to address the U.N. General Assembly this week.

Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow reopened the Commons at 11:30 on Wednesday morning, telling MPs that the official record will be changed so the reference to parliament being prorogued will be “expunged”, with it being recorded instead that it had been adjourned until today.

The first urgent question was from Joanna Cherry of the pro-EU, leftist Scottish Nationalist Party, who brought one of two cases to the Supreme Court to force parliament to reopen. Cherry asked for the government’s Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to give a statement on his legal opinion on his advice to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament.

Documents leaked to Sky News show Mr Cox had advised prorogation was “lawful and within the constitution” and that should anyone dispute it, they were doing so for “political consideration”.

Mr Cox responded to Ms Cherry, saying that while “we were disappointed that in the end the Supreme Court took a different view”, the government would respect the ruling.

“At all times the government acted in good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional,” he said.

Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, is set to make a statement at around 2pm on no deal preparations and Operation Yellowhammer, the no deal Brexit planning document.

Phillip Lee, the former Conservative MP who defected to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, told Mr Cox that he should be showing more humility, after Remainers had tried to pressure the attorney general to apologise for telling the government that prorogation was lawful and constitutional.

Incredulous at the being told to be more humble by an MP who was elected for the Tories and now sits as a Lib Dem without holding a by-election, Mr Cox said: “Words fail me, Mr Speaker, the Right Honourable Gentleman arises in the full force of his morality having been elected for one party and sitting there for another!”

12:30pm — Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: Parliament is “dead” and “has no moral right to sit”

The attorney general hit out at the opposition for twice blocking government calls for a snap general election, saying: “This parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.”

“This parliament is a disgrace,” he continued. “Given the opportunity, given since I am asked, let me tell them the truth, they could vote no confidence at any time, but they are too cowardly!”

“They could agree to a motion to allow this House to dissolve, but they are too cowardly!” he continued.

“This parliament should have the courage to face the electorate. But it won’t because so many of them are about preventing us leaving the European Union. But the time is coming when even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas,” he added.

12:20pm — Attorney General Geoffrey Cox refuses to rule out Tories suspending parliament again.

Remain-backing MP Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Conservative Cabinet minister who lost the party whip after voting against the government, asked Mr Cox if there would be another suspension of parliament “that save a few days before a Queen’s Speech” before the end of October.

The attorney general said there will be no prorogation which does not comply with the Supreme Court judgment, but did not rule out another suspension of parliament."

The accusations levelled against the judges were made during a Cabinet conference telephone call on Tuesday, according to sources speaking to the Daily Mail.

The Brexiteer is also reported to have said that the Supreme Court had undertaken “the most extraordinary overthrowing of the constitution” and accused the senior judges of being wrong, saying “some elements of the judgment are factually inaccurate”.

On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court, the highest court in the United Kingdom, ruled that Prime Minister Johnson’s decision to prorogue (suspend) parliament was unlawful, with Lady Hale saying “it had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without justification”.

Mr Johnson denied any wrong-doing, saying after the verdict, “I strongly disagree with this decision of the Supreme Court,” and also implied that the court case was not about preserving parliamentary democracy, but had been prompted by those who want to “frustrate Brexit”.

The prime minister returned to the UK on Wednesday morning after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, and is unlikely to be preparing to apologise to the House of Commons for the so-called ‘unlawful’ prorogation.

Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit preparations, also would not bend to pressure from Remainers to apologise, telling the BBC this morning: “I don’t think the Government should apologise also for saying that we are attempting to honour the democratic will of the British people.”

Delingpole: A Sinister, Nebulous Shadow Government Is Holding Brexit Hostage https://t.co/gOTAcTeIuD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019

It was reported last night that advice on suspending parliament had come from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the chief legal adviser to the government, who also is alleged to have said during the conversation that the court had overturned decades of precedent, saying he did not believe that “any prorogation over the past 50-100 years would have survived today’s judgment”.

The ruling has raised questions of whether the Supreme Court had extended its reach into political matters, with a senior ally of Mr Johnson telling the Daily Mail: “The effect of this is to pose the question, who runs this country? Are the courts saying they want to run the country now?”

The Supreme Court was only established in 2009, performing the formerly judicial functions of the House of Lords, after being created by the Tony Blair government in 2003. Reports at the time of its opening said that law lords were unhappy with its establishment, considering it ‘political vanity’ and not a properly considered piece of constitutional reform.

The Supreme Court is becoming a sacred cow in Britain which is beyond criticism; former Conservative MP Lord Peter Lilly however wrote for Brexit Central that “we are entitled to criticise this judge-made law”.

Stating that he had been informed by acquaintances of some of the Supreme Court judges that they had “expressed strident disbelief that anyone could support Brexit”, Lord Lilly warned of the problem of a politicised senior court that could make determinations on British laws.

The Brexiteer wrote: “The court’s failure to consider recent statute or precedents is alarming in itself. But it is even more alarming as a symptom of judges taking upon themselves the right to derive new laws from vague and selected abstract principles.

“That can only lead to politicisation of judges, their selection on the basis of their political philosophy and the consequent loss of public respect for the judiciary and the law.”"

Mr Johnson made a simple retelling of a Classical legend while addressing the United Nations Wednesday morning where a Titan displeases the gods and is punished to eternal torment in revenge, and alluded to the grave offence made by the British people not following the instructions of the pro-Europe elite when they voted for Brexit in 2016. The Prime Minister said:

“…when Prometheus brought fire to mankind in a tube of fennel, as you may remember with his brother Epimetheus, Zeus punished him by chaining him to a Tartanian crag while his liver was pecked out… by an eagle. And each time his liver regrew, the eagle came back and pecked it again.

“And this went on forever — a bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK if some of our parliamentarians have their way.”

It is not clear from his words whether Mr Johnson sees himself as the Titan Prometheus — doomed to be tortured for eternity by an invisible and unaccountable elite on Mount Olympus or whether Britain itself is the bringer of fire. In this case, Mr Johnson could self-identify as the Greek hero Heracles, who after several years slays the punishing eagle and saves Prometheus/Britain from the eternal torturous depths of Brexit-delay hell.

The remark — which given Mr Johnson’s well-known enthusiasm for the classics and frequent references to myths and legend in his speeches is not unusual — came in a speech that otherwise avoided the topic of Brexit and focussed on the importance of harnessing new technology for good rather than evil.

Name-checking Google as a corporation collecting vast amounts of data about citizens with little oversight, the Prime Minister warned of a new reality where maintaining privacy or even keeping secrets was all but impossible.

Mr Johnson is returning to the United Kingdom today, cutting his trip to the United Nations short after the UK Supreme Court ruled against his government, finding that he had acted unlawfully in suspending Parliament. Mr Johnson said Tuesday that while he respects the courts, he disagrees with the decision and hit out at remainers frustrating the Brexit process.

Parliament will resume sitting Wednesday morning following the ruling."

“We at the Commission decided not to intervene, at the request of David Cameron, and that was a big mistake,” Mr Juncker told Spanish daily El País.

This is not the first time the most senior figure in the European Union has thought it was his place to meddle in Britons’ decision to leave the EU, saying in May that then-Prime Minster Cameron was wrong telling him not to “intervene” in British affairs.

“It was a mistake [for Brussels] not to intervene and not to interfere, because we would have been the only ones to destroy the lies that were circulated round,” Mr Juncker had said.

“I was wrong to be silent at an important moment,” he added.

If the head of the EU’s executive arm appeared restrained during the time for a sovereign nation to make a decision, it was rare moment for Brussels, which is notorious for asking its Member States’ citizens to vote again if the vote was against the bloc’s interest.

In 1992, Denmark voted against the Maastricht Treaty — which advanced integration and turned the European Community, as the bloc was then known, into the European Union — but Danes were made to vote again.

Ireland voted ‘no’ to the Nice Treaty — which introduced a defence cooperation policy as an endeavour of Brussels — in 2001, but was made to vote again.

The French and the Dutch voted against the European Constitution in 2005, but were ignored. Mr Juncker, then-prime minister of Luxembourg, rejected the decision of both nations, saying: “The French and Dutch did not really vote ‘no’ to the European Constitution.”

Extraordinarily, Juncker had said ahead of the French vote that essentially, the people’s decision was immaterial, saying: “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’.”"

Let’s not waste time poring over the legal niceties of its decision. This is a coup by the judicial establishment, the vast majority of which happens to be comprised of shameless, doctrinaire Remainers.

It’s not, of course, the first time this has happened. Back in 2016, while it was still a pro-Brexit newspaper, the Daily Mail infamously ran a front-page story headlined Enemies of the People.

It was infamous not because what it said was in any way inaccurate — the judicial Establishment is indeed setting itself against the democratically expressed will of the majority of the British people in the EU referendum.

Rather, it became infamous because the liberal elite, pro-Remain Establishment declared it to be so.

Canting, posturing Remainer after canting, posturing Remainer lined up to tell anyone who’d listen just how disgraceful it was of the Mail to suggest that Britain’s senior judges are anything but impartial.

But they are not impartial. We know this from their decision-making which has tended in an almost wholly Remainer direction.

They will say – as every Remainer is already saying on social media – that their personal biases had absolutely no bearing on today’s Supreme Court decision.

No one on the Brexit side of the argument is remotely convinced by this.

The lessons are part of the All About Me sex education programme being taught to six- to ten-year-olds, with children being taught “self-stimulation” and that touching their own “private parts” in bed or in the bath is perfectly normal, according to documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday.

The lessons are being taught at 241 primary schools across Warwickshire County Council and as part of sex education classes.

Under a section entitled ‘Touching Myself’ targetted at six- and seven-year-olds, teachers are told to explain to the young children that “lots of people like to tickle or stroke themselves as it might feel nice” which may include touching their “private parts”. The teachers were told to make clear that even if someone may said that masturbating is “dirty”, they should tell their young charges that it is “very normal”.

Children are to be taught “rules about self-stimulation” such as that it is “not polite” to touch your genitals in public, but should be done in the bathroom or in bed. In one lesson, pupils are told a girl called Autumn “has a bath and is alone she likes to touch herself between her legs. It feels nice.”

Kids Being ‘Groomed’ into Copycat Sex Swaps, Warns Whistleblower at School with 17 ‘Trans Pupils’ https://t.co/76ywRrEzVF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 19, 2018

Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) classes for all schoolchildren from the age of four have been made mandatory by the Conservative government from September 2020, and the All About Me lesson cycle could be introduced by other school districts across the country.

Two parents pulled their sons out of lessons at Coten End Primary School in Warwick during the week the programme was taught, which is currently the right of any British parent. However, the government has made RSE classes mandatory from next year and parents will not be allowed to withdraw their young children from learning about masturbation or other topics set to be taught including gay relationships and transgenderism.

The notionally Conservative government has set out a broad and vague guidance on RSE and for age-appropriate lessons; however, individual schools, authorities, and lesson providers will produce content they deem fit for topic and age which the parents cannot object to.

Conservative Party MP David Davies, who backed the government forcing all schoolchildren to receive RSE, criticised the “sexualisation” of young children through these lessons, saying: “I and many other parents would be furious at completely inappropriate sexual matters being taught to children as young as six. These classes go way beyond the guidance the Government is producing and are effectively sexualising very young children.”

Parent Backlash as Cross-Dressing Men Sent Into Primary Schools to ‘Promote Tolerance’ https://t.co/7T1wdrhxnq — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 25, 2018

Religious and family groups have warned that the vague rules set by the Department for Education for RSE could result in chlidren being taught inappropriate content, with parents legally powerless to protect their children from sexualised material or ideas incompatible with mainstream religious beliefs.

Breitbart London has been reporting since 2016 on the Conservative government’s plans to overhaul how sex education is taught in the United Kingdom, taking it out of the hands of parents and fully under State control. Sold to the public as a means of teaching beyond the “science of reproduction”, the government said it aimed to protect children by arming them with knowledge of domestic abuse, sexual grooming, and online safety, as well as “preparing young people for success in adult life” in “modern Britain”.

It was then in February 2017 that the government announced that these classes were not just intended for teens, but for children as young as four years old, that parental opt-outs would cease, and classes would be forced upon children not just in State-run schools, but private schools, academies, free schools, and religious schools which are by nature socially conservative.

Draft guidelines kept mostly under wraps, in December 2017 the government confirmed that part of the four-to-eighteen curriculum would include lessons on same-sex relationships and transgenderism, with a shift from taking sex education out of the realms of biology into the realm of “values” whereby progressive ideas about sexuality and gender are to be taught from the position of acceptance and, as parents and conservative activists argue, celebration. The government maintained that lessons would be developed around “age-appropriate content” and taught in a “sensitive” manner.

February 2019 revealed government guidance would include teaching young children on gender reassignment, LGBT “families”, and discussing challenges to religious teaching on gay sex.

Schools Ordered to Teach Eight-Year-Olds That ‘Boys Can Have Periods Too’ https://t.co/k01OOBoogs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 16, 2018

Regulations on teaching relationships, sex, and health education were passed on May 9th, and despite petitions and calls from religious and parenting groups, the government did not back down from allowing parents opt-outs for their children.

Christian group Christian Concern warned that teaching about sex, transgenderism, and LGBT lifestyles to young children risks “robbing them of their innocence”, while a Jewish orthodox activist warned that Jews may be forced to leave the UK rather than allow their children to be taught from a young age from the government’s progressive sex education agenda, counter to religious teaching.

In June, the education secretary confirmed that all children will be taught same-sex relationships in keeping with the “diversity of our society”, and some schools ran with the Conservative government’s new regulations to begin teaching same-sex relationships to very young children now, the lessons sparking protests in spring and summer 2019 from parents in Muslim-majority schools after teachers began teaching gay relationships to their children.

Mass protests were held for weeks at Birmingham schools Anderton Park Primary School, Parkfield Primary School, and Chilwell Croft academy, with Muslim community leaders and parents saying the classes were “promoting homosexuality” and were “sexualising” children, with some as young as four showing signs of confusion after being told that girls can be boys and boys can be girls. The i newspaper reported last week a spike in the number of children in Birmingham being pulled out of mainstream schools into homeschooling, determining it to be related to Muslim parents’ objection to sex education classes.

Whether seeking to stay faithful to the letter of the government’s law, or taking it to extremes such as the Warwickshire schools in teaching six-year-olds about masturbation, it is likely that more parents will opt to homeschool, with homeschooling having increased 40 per cent in three years, numbering some 48,000 children as of 2018.

However, the government is set to take control over teaching in the home as well, with legislation planned to force parents of homeschooled children to sign a register agreeing to protect their children from “dangerous influences”. Parents and homeschooling activists are concerned that the proposed law will result in government intrusions into the foundations of family life."

Sir Jim, a joiner’s son who grew up in a council house but now leads INEOS — Britain’s biggest private company — is best known as a petrochemicals tycoon, but expressed a desire to get into the carmaking business after Jaguar Land Rover announced it would be ceasing production of its iconic Defender due to European Union emissions regulations.

Jaguar Land Rover opted to take advantage of the EU’s free movement regime to build its new version of the Defender in low-wage Slovakia, with the move out of Britain assisted by £110 million in state aid from the Slovakian government which the EU approved — much to the chagrin of British taxpayers, who transfer significant sums of money to Slovakia through their loss-making contributions to the EU budget each year.

Sir Jim’s new Grenadier 4×4 was mooted as something of a tribute to the Defender, with his INEOS Automotive subsidiary now developing a production site at Bridgend, Wales, for a planned launch in 2021.

Engineered for the world. Built in Britain. We’re delighted to announce that our #uncompromising 4×4 will be built in Wales and named @INEOSGrenadier.

“The decision to build in the UK is a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing which has always been at the heart of what INEOS stands for,” Sir Jim said of his new project, to which he has committed £600 million in investment.

The announcement is good news for Bridgend residents, who were facing job losses as the town’s Ford plant heads for closure — a fact Remain-leaning broadcasters have been keen to highlight, although Ford itself has confirmed the plant is being closed because it is “economically unsustainable” and not because of Brexit.

In fact, Ford Europe is cutting jobs across the continent, with Germany actually set to lose more jobs than Britain despite being far more firmly embedded in the EU’s structures and firmly committed to continued EU membership.

Major broadcasters such as the BBC, Channel 4, and Sky News appeared to give these European job cuts far less prominence than the smaller British job cuts in their reporting.

The prince has already announced he and the duchess will have no more than two children because of the concerns they share for the environment.

Even so, the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, their grace and favour home on the Windsor estate, at a cost to the taxpayer of £2.4 million, drew criticism for unnecessary extravagance.

So too did the Duchess of Sussex’s last-minute dash to New York two weeks ago to watch her friend Serena Williams play in the U.S. Open tennis final.

The British Labour party, the main opposition and sometimes party of government for almost a century has been discussing policy and platforms at its annual conference, with party members voting on a surprising raft of areas. In addition to its determination to give the vote in future national elections to foreign citizen residents — who party leaders figure would be sympathetic to their open-borders rhetoric — and decision to forcibly seize the property of private schools, Labour members polled at the conference admit to holding a range of extreme views.

Labour members at the conference — where delegates routinely refer to each other as “comrade” — were polled at 50 as being embarrassed by singing the national anthem against 20 in favour, 48 per cent in favour of abolishing borders against 25 in favour of retaining them, and 43 per cent of being ashamed of Britain against 15 per cent who were proud.

These figures against a backdrop of an attempted purge against top Labour figures proving difficult to the party leader Jeremy Corbyn paint a picture of a party in the last stages of a successful takeover by its most hardline members, Brexit leader Nigel Farage had said.

Speaking to Breitbart London, the Brexit Party frontman and MEP said of the party and Momentum, which grew out of the campaign vehicle which brought Mr Corbyn to be its leader in 2015: “I think it’s obvious the Labour Party is moving towards the hard left. It’s a Momentum takeover… there is a relentless war within the hard left to take over the Labour Party and they’ve come a very long way.

“And where the Labour party stands, where their members stand on issues like the Monarchy puts them so far away from traditional Labour voters… They are becoming a cult.”

Referencing both the last, and ultimately unsuccessful attempt by the hard-left to capture the Labour Party before left-centrist Tony Blair transformed it into an essentially globalist party in the 1990s and Jon Lansman, who has variously been described as the third most powerful man in the Labour Party and Mr Corbyn’s enforcer has been a key figure in pushing the latest surge to the left, Mr Farage continued: “They are ideologically motivated.

“I don’t think even winning the next election even matters to Lansman and Momentum, this is about a longer-term thing, having a hard-left Labour party in this country. They tried jolly hard in the late 70s and early 80s… but this time it looks like they are going to win.”

The Labour Party took another swing to the far-left under socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn after its members voted on Sunday to back plans that would see a future Labour government abolish Britain’s private schools, signalling members want the motion included in the party’s next election manifesto.

Members also voted to force universities to cut the number of independent school pupils they accept, whereby where currently 10 per cent of university matriculations are private school pupils, that would be capped at seven per cent, in line with the proportion of the wider population of children who attend fee-paying schools.

Speaking at the party’s conference in Brighton last night, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Labour will set its Social Justice Commission “to work on making the whole education system fairer through the integration of private schools”.

Labour: We will abolish private schools.

Me: But didn’t Corbyn go to a private school?

Labour: You can’t hold him responsible for his parents’ choices.

Me: But Diane Abbott sent her son to a private school.

Labour: That was years ago.

Me: But Shami Chakrabarti…

Labour: FASCIST! — Toby Young (@toadmeister) September 22, 2019

The members resolved “To include in the next Labour party general election manifesto a commitment to integrate all private schools into the state sector,” which would include “Endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions.”

Assets are often used by private schools to generate income, either to help maintain their independence, or, along with the tax-exemption charitable status — which Labour also vows to abolish — allows them to provide bursaries and scholarships to working class pupils.

The take-over of private schools would not be without cost, however, with the BBC noting that it would result in some 600,000 formerly-independent school pupils — the school population of Wales — to be educated by the public purse, an estimated £3.5 billion on top of the education budget.

Independent Schools Council chief executive Julie Robinson branded the move “an attack on the rights and freedoms of parents to make choices over the education of their children”, while the Independent Schools Association’s Neil Roskilly pointed out that if integration occurred, “teachers in the private sector wouldn’t choose to transfer into the state sector”.

Former deputy chairman of the Conservatives Lord Ashcroft pointed out that as a result of Labour’s to stop parental choice, private schools will “just pop up in Ireland or elsewhere”.

From tomorrow private schools will be consulting lawyers to find ways to transfer assets out of the U.K…predictable capital flight… pic.twitter.com/QZgK3PZFM2 — Lord Ashcroft (@LordAshcroft) September 22, 2019

Labour was criticised for its hypocrisy, as a number of MPs in the shadow government and other senior figures had either benefitted from private education themselves or sent their children to independent schools, including: party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Seumas Milne, his communications director, and Jon Lansman, the Momentum chief, who all attended private school; shadow home secretary Diane Abbott sent her son to the private City of London school; and Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti sent her son to the private Dulwich College.

Concern was also raised last night by Labour’s “chilling” seizure of private assets, with David Gauke MP, formerly of the Conservative Party, saying: “I didn’t go to a private school. My children don’t go to private schools. But Labour’s new policy on abolishing private schools and seizing private property is chilling.”

After Labour had banned establishing new academic-attainment selective grammar schools in a previous government, there is the question of where Labour’s policies of stopping school choice or making illegal so-called “unfairness” in the education system would end, given British parents also pay privately for tutors, music teachers, and other non-State controlled extracurricular activities. The BBC’s education and family correspondent Sean Coughlan wrote: “Why not other forms of non-state education – whether it’s nurseries, private tutors, professional training, universities or driving schools for that matter? Apart from property rights, there would be questions about human rights. How can you stop a parent choosing to pay someone to teach their child?”

While in theory no previous British government can bind the next, even if a successive Conservative government decided to reestablish private schools, those institutions would be without the assets, land, and other endowments that enabled them to be independent in the first place. Assets once seized and redistributed by the State cannot be returned to its owners with ease or without enormous further cost to the taxpayer."

Another woman, identified as her mother can be seen attempting to physically restrain her as she becomes violent, to which she responds “No, let me hit.”

According to witnesses, the tirade began after the woman’s mother began complaining to the bus driver that he was letting to many people on board, prompting the Indian male to ask her to stop arguing so the vehicle could continue on its journey.

Addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Macron called on the two nations to begin negotiations in order to mitigate the risk of conflict in the Arabian Gulf region, BFMTV reports.

“More than ever, the time has come for the resumption of negotiations between the United States of America, Iran, the signatories of the JCPOA [the Iranian nuclear deal] and the powers of the region concerned primarily with security and the stability of it,” Macron said.

He added that negotiations should be directed in such a way that there is total certainty that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon and said negotiations could also find a “way out” of the conflict in Yemen.

“I have no naivety and I do not believe in miracles, I believe in the courage to build peace, and I know that the United States of America, Iran, all the signatories of this agreement have this courage,” he said.

Since the G7 earlier this month in France, Macron and the French government have positioned themselves as mediators between the United States and Iran, inviting Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the G7 in a surprise visit.

Earlier this week, Macron also met with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for two hours, allegedly to attempt to convince the Iranian president to de-escalate tensions in the region following the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, an attack many blame on Tehran.

President Macron also reacted to a new complaint filed to the UN by climate activists including Greta Thunberg that seeks to penalise France and four other countries for violating the rights of children due to inaction on the topic of climate change.

“I’m not sure that this is the most effective way,” Macron said and added that he did not feel that the French or German governments were blocking effective change on the issue of the climate."

Reports said the elderly woman from Compiègne, France, thought the 8″ x 10″ painting was just an old religious icon. But when she had it valued, experts said there was no question as to where the piece came from.

“It didn’t take long for us to see that it was an artwork by Italian painter Cimabue. He’s a father of painting so we know his work very well,” said Jerome Montcouquil of art specialists Cabinet Turquin.

“Cimabue, who taught Italian master Giotto, is widely considered the forefather of the Italian Renaissance. He broke from the Byzantine style popular in the Middle Ages and incorporated elements of movement and perspective that came to characterize Western painting,” according to the Charlotte Observer.

The piece by the 13th century artist titled “Christ Mocked” is estimated to be worth between $4.3 million and $6.6 million, France 24 reported.

“The painting is thought to be part of a large diptych dating from 1280 when Cimabue painted eight scenes depicting Christ’s passion and crucifixion,” the report stated.

Expert Éric Turquin said that the tunnels made by wood-eating larvae aided him in confirming the painting’s authenticity.

“You can follow the tunnels made by the worms,” Turquin said. “It’s the same poplar panel.”

Montcouquil said experts used infrared light to examine the painting and discovered that they could even see the distinct corrections made by Cimabue, which matched his other works. The facial expressions of the subjects and the depiction of the buildings also match the artist’s style.

“It’s wonderful to be reminded that there are paintings of such major importance that are still out there and still to be discovered,” said independent art consultant, Alexis Ashot.

Reports said the painting is set to go to the Acteon auction house on October 27 in Senlis, France."

The ruling came about as a result of a court case against a manufacturer which produced “shots” and dissolvable powders it claimed could cure hangovers.

The state court ruled in a verdict released on Monday that since a hangover is technically an illness, the company’s marketing had violated laws on foods being described as able to treat illnesses.

The regional court said in comments reported by The Guardian: “Information about a food product cannot ascribe any properties for preventing, treating or healing a human illness or give the impression of such a property.”

“By an illness, one should understand even small or temporary disruptions to the normal state or normal activity of the body,” the ruling added, which included headaches, nausea, and fatigue associated with recovering from heavy drinking.

The judges noted that doctors do use the medical term “veisalgia” to describe alcoholic hangovers.

Germany’s 186th Oktoberfest started on Saturday, with 7.5 million litres of beer expected to have been drunk by some six million festival goers over the course of 18 days.

A report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in September revealed that people in Europe drink more alcohol than in any other region in the world.

Adults in Europe drink an average of two bottles of wine per week, with Germans, Czechs, and Lithuanians being the heaviest drinkers. Binge drinking was found to be most common in Germany, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Slovenia."

Essentially a cabal of Remainer Establishment stooges in gold-braided judicial robes voted, nem con, to raise their middle fingers to British democracy and to punish Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his temerity in trying to deliver Brexit.

Ostensibly, the court’s ruling concerned the legality of Johnson’s prorogation of parliament.

In reality, it was yet another power play by the Remainer Establishment which for over three years now has done everything it possibly can to frustrate the democratically expressed wish of the British people to leave the European Union.

Other wreckers in the Remainer Establishment have included: John Bercow, the dwarfish Speaker of the House of Commons; Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England; the Archbishop of Canterbury; former Prime Ministers Theresa May, David Cameron and John Major; several leading Conservative MPs including Sir Nicholas (“Did I ever mention that my grandfather was Winston Churchill?”) Soames; the majority of parliament; most of the Civil Service; the BBC; the City of London; the corporations; the City law firms; academe; etc.

Today it was the senior judiciary’s turn to swing the wrecking ball.

Parliament, which is dominated by Remain-voting MPs, had been consistently frustrating Boris Johnson’s attempts to strike an exit deal with the European Union, making his democratically mandated job of delivering Brexit all but impossible.

Boris Johnson briefly suspended — ‘prorogued’ — parliament, so that his government could get on with performing its number one most urgent task unimpeded and, they say, introduce new domestic legislation through a Queen’s speech.

Well that was the plan, anyway.

But Speaker Bercow had other ideas. In the four days in which parliament did sit before its prorogation, the Speaker abused his power to give the Opposition control of the parliamentary agenda and to railroad through a bill that normally could never have been passed in so short a space.

This bill effectively made it a criminal offence for Boris Johnson to deliver a proper, full, No Deal Brexit.

No Deal was — and is — Boris’s best bargaining chip in his negotiations with the intransigent EU which, given half the chance, will impose the harshest terms exit terms possible on the UK in order to prevent any other of its prisoner nation-states trying to escape.

EU Prez: UK’s Experience of Leaving EU Will Serve as a ‘Deterrent’ to Others https://t.co/lr97iLmviR — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 11, 2019

By removing this bargaining chip, parliament removed any incentive the EU might have to produce a ‘deal’ sufficiently attractive to Conservative voters – most of whom are considerably more hardcore on Brexit than Boris Johnson’s government is.

So Boris is now stuck in a terrible bind. Another part of his plan — probably cooked up by his Machiavellian strategist Dominic Cummings — was that Britain would leave the EU, deal or no deal, on October 31. Shortly afterwards, he’d find a way of engineering a general election, which the Conservatives would win with a thumping majority.

But the leaving on October 31 bit looks increasingly unlikely because of the deal parliament has now more or less made impossible.

And the thumping majority looks unlikely too because if Johnson goes into an election not having delivered the Brexit he promised — even through no fault of his own — then a significant proportion of his votes may get hoovered up by The Brexit Party. This, in turn, would run the risk of splitting the Brexit vote and ushering in a reign of terror by Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist opposition.

At the moment, though, even the notion of a general election is academic. That’s because the complexities of the Fixed Term Parliament Act — one of the many stupid legacies of David Cameron’s coalition with the Liberal Democrats — means that Johnson can only engineer an election via a vote of No Confidence in his own government. The Labour opposition refuses to oblige him with this No Confidence vote because its MPs know that many of them will lose their seats and secretly fear the British public deeply disagree with them. So currently, it’s stalemate.

Now, if you didn’t know this already, you’re in a position to understand what is so shockingly anti-democratic about today’s Supreme Court decision.

In one sense it’s trivial to the point of meaningless: Boris’s prorogation of parliament didn’t achieve its purpose so it doesn’t much matter now that the prorogation has now been rendered unlawful — meaning that parliament will go back to ‘work’ (LOL!) tomorrow.

In another sense, though, it’s a constitutional disaster. The Supreme Court is a very unBritish and very recent institution — a hangover from the Tony Blair era, established as recently as 2005 — designed to realign Britain’s old-established legal system with the more modish (as Blair would have seen it) and EU friendly Continental model. With this decision, it has peremptorily arrogated to itself the most extraordinary powers to meddle in areas hitherto considered beyond its purview.

It is, as Peter Hitchens has noted, a form of judicial activism.

Peter Hitchens @ClarkeMicah is absolutely correct. A committee of lawyers has engaged in an act of US-style judicial activism without any of the scrutiny or oversight built into that system. Their legal reasoning is virtually non-existent and reveals totally political motives. — Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) September 24, 2019

In the US there are checks and balances to this kind of judicial activism, with potential Supreme Court candidates being scrutinised on issues like their character and political bias.

The 11 justices of the Supreme Court are subject to little such scrutiny. Hitherto, Britain’s political and legal institutions have been run and regulated on the basis that their denizens will act in good faith, rather than – like the Supreme Court today – like activists for their preferred political cause.

This is very worrying for the future of British democracy.

As Brendan O’Neill rightly points out at Spiked, it is close to tyranny:

What we have seen emerge via this judgement is a borderline tyrannical layer in British politics. A layer that stands above everyone and everything, including the government itself. A layer of unrepresentative, unaccountable individuals who have now presumed the authority to strike down actual government decisions. This instantly weakens any future government’s claim to moral and political authority and their basic ability to relate to parliament, to negotiate treaties, and to act on the will of the people. The precedent set today is that any of that might potentially be subject to the higher, apparently wiser judgement of politicised courts. It is an outrage."

The investigation by the NCA into Leave.EU, Better for the Country Ltd, Arron Banks, and Elizabeth Bilney were triggered after Britain’s electoral commission referred their own investigation to the top crime-fighting agency over conduct during the 2016 referendum.

The electoral commission itself has been persistently dogged by claims over its impartiality and apparent anti-Brexit bias, and Mr Banks said Tuesday he would be taking the commission to court over their persecution of him. The NCA said in a statement:

In carrying out its complex investigation the NCA analysed information, including banking information, which had not formed part of the Electoral Commission’s investigation. It also interviewed Mr Banks and Ms Bilney. In reaching its decision, the NCA obtained advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and expert independent counsel due to the technical nature of PPERA offences and the company structures involved. …The NCA has found no evidence that any criminal offences have been committed under PPERA or company law by any of the individuals or organisations referred to it by the Electoral Commission. It will therefore take no further action against Mr Banks, Ms Bilney, Better for the Country Ltd or Leave.EU in respect of this specific matter. This investigation has been subject to press and social media commentary. The NCA has not received any evidence to suggest that Mr Banks and his companies received funding from any third party to fund the loans, or that he acted as an agent on behalf of a third party.

The announcement follows a separate move earlier this month by the Metropolitan Police that their own investigation into alleged criminality by the Leave.EU campaign was being wound up as they had found nothing to investigate.

“It was right to investigate the allegation [against Leave.EU], however following detailed enquiries it became apparent that the nature of potential breaches of the regulations, the criminal standard of proof required in court and the actions taken by Leave.EU to adhere to the regulations, mean that it is now appropriate to take no further action,” explained Commander Alex Murray, of the force’s Central Specialist Crime team."

The Wall Street Journal reports that German prosecutors have charged -Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Herbert Diess, Chairman Hans Dieter Pötsch, and former CEO Martin Winterkorn for allegedly misleading shareholders in the months prior to the firm’s 2015 “Dieselgate” diesel emissions-cheating scandal. The 635-page indictment from prosecutors in Braunschweig near Volkswagen’s headquarters in Wolfsburg argues that the executives withheld key information about the scandal from investors in an attempt to uphold the firm’s share price.

The company has attempted to put the emissions scandal behind it for some time, the indictments of the executives and in particular, Chief Executive Herbert Diess is a huge blow to the firm. The company’s shares dropped by nearly half in value in 2015 when it was revealed that the firm that cheated the emissions tests of diesel-powered vehicles for almost a decade. The ensuing criminal and civil cases along with fines and penalties cost the company around $30 billion.

Volkswagen and the accused executives have stated that the indictment is groundless and Diess stated through his lawyer that he would continue to operate as CEO of the firm. Prosecutors argue that the executives knew about the cheating and potential damages in 2015 and should have informed financial markets about the U.S. investigation.

“But instead, each one of them intentionally and with full awareness decided not to publish an ad hoc statement in order to keep Volkswagen’s share price at its current level and prevent losses for VW AG,” said prosecutors in a statement. Attorneys for Pötsch who became chairman in 2015 stated that the indictment was groundless saying: “In the summer of 2015, no obligation to inform the capital market arose at any time even from a purely capital-market law perspective.”

Attorney for Winketron stated that the former Volkswagen CEO who resigned following the 2015 scandal “had no prior knowledge of the intentional use of illegal engine control software in U.S. diesel cars.” Arndt Ellinghorst, an automotive analyst at Evercore ISI, a brokerage, commented on the indictment stating: “These charges will trigger a long-lasting court case and we believe it to be unlikely that VW will face material negative financial and/or management consequences.”

Following the Dieselgate scandal in 2015, two Volkswagen executives pled guilty to U.S. law violations and are serving time in U.S. prisons.

Reuters reports that Google will not be forced to apply Europe’s “right to be forgotten” law worldwide following a ruling by a top E.U. court. This means that while Google will have to remove links to sensitive personal data from Internet search results in the E.U. when required, it does not have to remove these results from searches from other parts of the world.

The case is being viewed by policymakers and companies as a test of whether or not European Union laws can be extended beyond the continent’s own territory. The ruling applies to all search engines and is surprisingly positive news for the tech industry which has been heavily scrutinized in recent months with talks of heavy regulations.

In the judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union stated that the right to have personal data protected is not an absolute right. The court stated in its ruling: “The balance between the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the freedom of information of Internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world.”

Google commented on the decision stating: “It’s good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.” Patrick Van Eecke, global chair of the data protection practice at law firm DLA Piper, stated that the ruling would directly impact the effectiveness of a successful right to be forgotten application as it would only apply to searches within the E.U.

“This might obviously be frustrating for people who will see that people from outside Europe will still be able to find the de-listed search results when performing the same search on Google in New York, Shanghai or any other place in the world,” he added.

As a member of the European political bloc, the UK is not able to negotiate and sign its own trade deals — as with many other areas of competence, this is managed by the central EU bureaucracy based in Brussels. But with the British people having voted in 2016 to leave the EU for good, it is presumed that the country will soon be free to conduct its own business.

The United States has been a steadfast ally of the United Kingdom since President Donald Trump took office, with several senior figures in the administration praising the mutual benefit to be had from a new trade deal. Speaking Tuesday morning in New York, President Trump again stated his faith in the plan, telling delegates to the United Nations:

“As the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the UK that will bring tremendous benefits to both of our countries. We are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal.”

Boris Johnson himself also spoke approvingly of improving trade with the United States Tuesday, telling a breakfast meeting of U.S. and Canadian business leaders in New York that he intended to “roll out the red carpet” to North American business. He told the gathering: “We’re going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give whether it’s new tax allowances for businesses or speedier public procurement contracts or creating new free ports, enterprise zones, devising better regulations for sectors the UK leads the world [… and] more competitive tax rates.”

President Trump’s words will be a boost to Mr Johnson on a difficult day where the Prime Minister has faced negative press at home after the UK Supreme Court ruled he had acted unlawfully in suspending Parliament prior to a new session in October. Mr Johnson for his part said he disagreed with the ruling and cited anti-Brexit partisans fighting his attempts to deliver the result of the 2016 referendum in Parliament and elsewhere was a source of instability in the United Kingdom.

The two leaders met for a bilateral Tuesday and shared a photocall before going into private meetings where President Trump praised Mr Johnson in glowing terms, expressing his confidence that Brexit on October 31st would go well and that positive results from Brexit would be visible in November. When a journalist asked whether Mr Johnson would be resigning, the President again spoke up for Mr Johnson, saying: “don’t you worry, I know him, he isn’t going anywhere.”"

Addressing American and Canadian business leaders at a breakfast reception in New York City on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Prime Minister Johnson said he wants to deepen North American-British trade.

“We want to do so much more, because our country is going up a gear,” the prime minister said. “On October 31st, we intend to be more global, more outward looking, more committed to the rest of the world than ever before.

“We’re going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give whether it’s new tax allowances for businesses or speedier public procurement contracts or creating new free ports, enterprise zones, devising better regulations for sectors the UK leads the world [… and] more competitive tax rates.”

The United States is the United Kingdom’s second-largest trading partner, and European leaders are frightened the effect that a closer Anglo-American alliance would have on the bloc: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week that she feared the UK becoming an “economic competitor” on Europe’s doorstep; European Council President-elect Charles Michel expressed concern how the EU would keep close ties with the UK if it is “now looking more and more toward the United States”; while Guy ‘Europe-Must-Become-an-Empire’ Verhofstadt said the EU will not accept the UK becoming a low-tax, low-regulation “Singapore on the North Sea”.

Mr Johnson continued: “We will roll out the red carpet for our American friends. We are increasing the number of visas for scientists. We’re ensuring that your brilliant students can stay on for two years so as to get real value from their studies and so that our economy in the UK benefits from their expertise.”

“We want to do the much-vaunted free trade deal,” the prime minister added, and lamented how current trade rules — in the EU and the U.S. — are preventing more trade, saying “it is absolutely absurd that there should be tariffs in the UK on Californian wine or British shoppers should pay over the odds for Florida orange juice. But it is also absurd that the population of America has gone for decades with not eating a morsel of British lamb, or beef — let alone haggis.”

“The US military are banned from buying British tape measures as if there were some kind of general prejudice still against British rulers of all kinds,” he joked, the prime minister managing to remain relaxed and in good humour despite the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling that his suspension of parliament was unlawful.

The Sun reported this week that the U.S. and UK could agree a bilateral trade deal that is wrapped up by as soon as July 2020. A senior government source told the tabloid: “The political will is there now on both sides to do the deal by July. It’s a great win for us, and Trump is also really keen to shout about it in the States.”

President Trump and Prime Minister Johnson are set to discuss trade on the fringes of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday."

In an interview with Europe 1, Macron branded the complaint as “very radical” and warned it would likely “antagonize societies.”

“All the movements of our youth — or our not-so-young — are helpful,” explained the globalist leader. “But they must now focus on those who are furthest away, those who are seeking to block the way.”

He went on to add that he rejects the notion that “the French government nor the German government, currently, were blocking the way.”

According to the suit — filed Monday by Thunberg and 15 other children — Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina, and Turkey have violated the activists’ rights as children. The five named countries are parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty signed by dozens of nations 30 years ago.

The children responsible for the suit claim the five nations haven’t done enough to prevent climate change’s “deadly and foreseeable consequences.”

“Our homes are being swallowed by the ocean, the places where memories are made,” Carlos Manual, a teenager from Palau, a nation consisting of 340 islands in the South Pacific, said at a press conference announcing the suit. “I am standing in front of you because I care about my generation.”

Earlier Monday, Thunberg, who has become the de facto leader of the youth climate movement, addressed attendees of Monday’s Climate Action Summit at the U.N. headquarters.

“You are failing us,” Thunberg told the politicians and policymakers assembled at U.N. headquarters. “But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”

The lawsuit does not seek monetary damages. If the suit is upheld, the U.N. would be forced to classify the climate change crisis as a human rights crisis.

Brune Poirson, France’s Ecological Transition Minister, joined Macron in criticizing Thunberg’s remarks, telling French radio station France Inter: “I am not sure that you mobilize people with despair, with what is almost hatred, setting people against each other.”

Asked by French media whether Thunberg had gone too far in her comments, France’s Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer bluntly responded, “Certainly.”

Appearing on the BBC radio show Desert Island Discs, Yorke said he was trying to change his ways.

“The thing I’ve always struggled somewhat with is that if I’m campaigning on climate change, I’m someone who has to fly for my work, so, boom, I’m a hypocrite,” he said. “I totally agree I’m a hypocrite, but I’m trying to do something about it, and yes, you’re right, I’m a hypocrite.”

Many might find Yorke’s honesty somewhat refreshing given that other prominent environmental activists, including former President Barack Obama, Prince Harry, and Leonardo DiCaprio have faced criticism for regularly flying on private jets. His confession comes as Swedish teen climate alarmist Greta Thunberg continues to lecture the world for what she says is global governments’ inability to combat climate change.

Thom Yorke has long been a committed environmental activist. Earlier this year, his band Radiohead responded to an alleged hack on a trove of their unreleased music by donating the $150,000 ransom fee to the environmental group Extinction Rebellion.

The 50-year-old is also a prominent political activist and supporter of the left-wing British Green Party, which champions environmental causes.

In 2017, Yorke and his bandmates enraged anti-Israel activists after dismissing a petition calling on them to refuse to perform in Israel in adherence to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.

“Playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing the government,” Yorke said at the time. “Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.”

Speaking to Kossuth Radio, the Szijjártó warned that the situation in Greece, where the flow of illegal migrants is once again rising into the thousands, has darkened, and that its islands are becoming “appallingly crowded” with new arrivals.

The Fidesz politician also warned of thousands of illegal migrants in the Western Balkans, many of whom are from Muslim-majority Albania and Kosovo — European countries but not members of the European Union or its borderless Schengen area — are “wreak[ing] havoc on the life of locals” and in shows of “extremely aggressive behaviour”.

Moreover, the Hungarian is ooncerned that the European Union’s only strategy for dealing with the migrant crisis is to try and “cram mandatory migrant quotas down the throats of European countries” with “anti-migration” governments — who have been weakened now that the Italian populist Matteo Salvini’s League (Lega) party has been displaced by the left-establishment Democratic Party (PD) in the Mediterraneran country’s coalition government.

Hungarian Minister: With Salvini Europe Was Safe https://t.co/eIwJ0tBU2X — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 20, 2019

Italy’s new “pro-migraiton leftist government”, Szijjártó lamented, has “dropped Salvini’s policy” of refusing to allow so-called “rescue” ships operated by NGOs seeking to land migrants from Libya exclusively in European ports to dock in Italy, and “returned to Brussels’ false narrative that illegal migration trends cannot be stopped” and must instead be “managed”.

For refusing to accept the migrant redistribution policy which the EU has attempted to impose, Hungary has “suffered a political revenge” in the form of various sanctions for alleged offences, the foreign minister claimed.

His comments follow a similar statement from Hungary’s new Minister of Justice, Judit Varga, claims that the “real cause” of these “offensives” is that “Hungary and Hungarians have refused since 2015 to allow the policies of the pro-immigration political forces” to be implemented.

“That’s why they’re attacking us, because we said no to migration.”

Perdue OKs Silicon Valley Takeover of College Graduate Job Market,"Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) now supports Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) green card giveaway bill, which will allow investors to reward many more Indian graduates for taking middle-class jobs from American college graduates.

Perdue’s decision to end his opposition to the bill clears the way for Lee to rush his bill through the Senate on Thursday. If no other senators object, Lee’s bill will move through the Senate, putting it much closer to becoming law.

The bill allows investors and their companies to reward many more Indian graduates who agree to take the college graduate jobs needed by young American graduates. The reward is the grant of 120,000 invaluable green cards — up from roughly 20,000 today — to the Indian outsourcing workers and their families.

That’s a huge boost for the investors in the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, who now import Indian graduates to spike stock prices by chopping white-collar payroll costs. So Perdue’s retreat is also a huge economic hit to the roughly 800,000 Americans who are graduating in 2019 with degrees in health care, science, engineering, accounting, business, software, math, or architecture.

The bill could also disrupt the immigration system for many other foreign migrants, including younger “dreamer” illegals and university scientists, as well as the next wave of foreign students, scientists, and professionals who are seeking to move into the United States. The House has already passed its version of the bill, H.R. 1044.

Perdue’s retreat was reported by Immigration Voice, a lobbying group of foreign workers who were imported by investors to take the middle-class jobs sought by U.S. graduates. The McClatchy News Service reported Perdue’s switch:

Georgia Sen. David Perdue says he no longer objects to Sen. Lee's green card bill: ""I supported his bill. It's consistent with what the White House has been working on. We just had some nuances in the language with regard to rural nurses and basically we worked that out."" — Bryan Lowry (@BryanLowry3) September 25, 2019

The Indian visa workers are now urging their members to call Sen. Dick Durbin’s (D-IL) office out of fear he might block Lee’s giveaway:

🚨ILLINOIS ACTION ITEM ALERT 🚨 Dear Friends, We need our members in Illinois to call Senator Dick Durbin in his Washington DC office at 202.224.2152 and ask him to support the unanimous consent of the bi-partisan Harris-Lee – Fairness For High Skilled immigrants act. Team IV — Immigration Voice (@immivoice) September 25, 2019

Durbin’s potential opposition was spotlighted by a September 7 report in the Wall Street Journal:

Democrats in the Senate have qualms, too. “They are increasing the immigration from countries like India a marginal small amount at the expense of cutting back on immigration from other countries in a much more dramatic fashion—I don’t think there’s equity in that,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).

Perdue’s office did not respond to Breitbart News. On September 19, Perdue explained his hold on Lee’s bill:

I want to comment my good friend from the great state of Utah, SM Lee, for his work on putting this bill together and pulling the people together to support this bill. I support this bill. Madam President. We have some language that needs to be clarified, and I still have some concerns about the impact this legislation would have on some specific industries, you know in my state but in the country. I want to work with Senator only in addressing these concerns and come to a resolution on this very quickly. I commit to working with him and his team to make sure that we get to a resolution because we want the exact same thing. And this is totally consistent with President [Donald] Trump is trying to do in as long term work to fix our broken immigration system in with that.

Activists say no GOP senators are ready to step forward to protect American graduates from the huge inflow of underpaid Indian graduates. Even populist senators such as Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) have avoided criticizing the investors’ stealthy no-hearing, no-debates rush to pass the bill.

Their passive stance comes amid a huge but stealthy push led by the technology companies and investors, such as Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and the Washington Post. The backers include Mark Zuckerberg, who met with Lee on September 19, on the same day that Perdue blocked his bill.

The demand by investors for endless migrant labor has created a new thing: The US-India Outsourcing Economy. This no-regulation zone redirects new wealth into a few cities & a small elite. Elites want to expand it, so US college-grads get #HR1044. https://t.co/4lWHtI3sUk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) July 19, 2019

Business groups have told senators that the bill is a minor change to immigration law and is intended to rectify what they describe as anti-Indian “country caps” discrimination. Those business groups already employ roughly 1.5 million foreign white-collar workers in the United States, including at least 800,000 Indians graduates.

Opponents and supporters of the green card giveaway are using Facebook and Twitter to urge their supporters to call senators to block or support the bill.

Only one GOP senator is needed to stop Lee’s bill, which is expected to be brought to the Senate floor on Thursday for a no-debate, no-media, fast-track “Unanimous Consent” approval process.

Few Democrats — if any — oppose Lee’s S.386 bill, which is strongly backed by the pro-Democrat Silicon Valley investors.

Nearly all Democrats voted for the House version of the bill.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have said they oppose the Indian outsourcing bill — but White House officials have not said if the bill will be opposed by President Donald Trump — even though Trump needs to boost his sagging support among white-collar suburban voters.

White-collar Americans have formed a series of groups to defend their careers against the investors’ visa workers. They include the American Workers Coalition, ProUSworkers, and Doctorswithoutjobs.com.

These groups say that the expanded number of green cards will flood the labor markets for engineers and software experts. The bill will also allow U.S. investors to annually recruit hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates to compete for American college jobs and green cards. The Indians can get work permits via the uncapped Optional Practical Training (OPT), B1, L-1, H4EAD, and H-1B visa worker programs. U.S. workers also say they are routinely discriminated against and excluded by the U.S.-based Indian managers and Indian recruiters who run the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy.

Lou Dobbs, on Fox News, has repeatedly denounced the giveaway:

#AmericaFirst– @EdRollins: @POTUS has made a commitment to create jobs for Americans, particularly young Americans coming out of college. This Senate bill would create competition for them by giving visas to Indian students & give them jobs at lower wages. #NOS386 #MAGA #Dobbs pic.twitter.com/ipZuAlQllv — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) September 23, 2019

Populist groups — such as Americans for Legal Immigration PAC — also oppose the Silicon Valley takeover.

Additionally, would-be immigrants are opposing the Lee bill because it will push the investors’ current army of at least 300,000 Indian tech workers — plus more to come — up to the head of the line for 120,000 green cards each year. For example, the Multinational Coalition includes many Chinese graduate students who will have to work as low-wage student lab technicians for many years in their late 20s if they hope to get green cards.

These pro-migration opponents of Lee’s bill also include Support All of Us and many other pro-migration groups who are keeping their opposition quiet.

This shift towards Indian outsourcing will also cut off the flow of employer-sponsored migrants into Florida’s Spanish-speaking economy, say immigration lawyers in Florida.

This bill is a giveaway overwhelmingly to one industry (tech) and it means that individuals from one country (India) will get most to all of the employment-based visas for the next 10 years, within even longer backlogs after that. — Amy Maldonado (@AmyMaldonadoLaw) September 25, 2019

But Perdue’s shift is being cheered by the India visa workers who take the graduate jobs needed by Americans. For example, “Ramesh S,” who is working in North Carolina, applauded Perdue’s switch:

Thank you 🙏, @sendavidperdue for hearing us and agreeing to support and co-sponsor S386 bill. pic.twitter.com/Y3LxPfLZeg — Ramesh S (@chandar2020) September 25, 2019

Most of the Indian workers are being imported to run the U.S. side of the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, which is used by investors to transfer Americans’ salaries into their Wall Street stock values.

For example, Walmart is boosting its stock value by outsourcing 569 finance and accounting jobs in North Carolina to cheaper H-1B workers from India. If the company saves $10,000 per employee, Walmart will save $5.7 million per year. On Wall Street, Walmart’s price to earnings rate is 25 to one, so the $5.7 million in payroll savings will boost its stockholders’ value by $142 million.

Walmart picked an American company, Genpact, to supply the Indian workers. The company is a spin-off of General Electric, and it prospers by providing Indian H-1B workers to many companies in the United States. For example, the company asked for 271 H-1Bs in 2018, 410 H-1Bs in 2017, and 307 H-1Bs in 2016.

Genpact’s H-1Bs work on the U.S. side of the vast and growing U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, now worth roughly $78 billion per year. Part of the H-1Bs’ job is to funnel additional work back into India. For example, Genpact may only need to use 100 H-1Bs in North Carolina to help steer the work of the 569 fired American finance experts back to large teams of low-wage Indian graduates in India.

Genpact’s $3.3 billion in revenue is enough to generate $7.5 billion in stock value for its investors, which include Bain Capital, Blackrock, and Charles Schwab Investment Management.

Employers reward the low-wage Indian workers by giving them green cards, which allow them to become U.S. citizens — and to then import their immediate and extended families from India to the United States.

The investors are mostly based on the coasts, so their wealth is helping to spike income and real estate values in New York and California — while the reduced investment and payroll in heartland states reduce their business income, real estate values, skilled workforces, and political power.

H-1B imported workers in Georgia get paid less than Americans, so they spend less (about $300M less) on local groceries, retail, rents, etc. Investors send the savings to Wall St. to get 25:1 gains. IOW, visa workers hurt many & help the few wealthy @S386 https://t.co/LI7eHEAfN3 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 25, 2019

Immigration Numbers

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full-time, year-round work."

This 54 to 41 vote was not about the border wall, but whether “the Congress of the United States of America should yield its constitutionally prescribed power of the purse to the President,” said Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins.

“The answer to that question, regardless of who is in the White House … should be no,” Collins continued. “Congress alone is empowered by the constitution to adopt laws directing money from the U.S. Treasury.”

The president “stole” the money, and “I will not stand for that,” said Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy. The president took the funding from other projects, such as the replacement of older schools at military bases, said Leahy, who is the top Democrat on the appropriations panel.

Senators should vote against the resolution because “there is no Earthly reason why Democrats would force us to have one or the other,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).

“The joint resolution is passed,” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney announced from the Senate’s chair.

The 11 GOP senators who voted against the emergency and the wall included Collins, Romney, retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (TN), along with Sens. Roy Blunt (MO), Mike Lee (UT), Jerry Moran (KS), Lisa Murkowski (AK), Rand Paul (KY), Rob Portman (OH), Pat Toomey (PA), and Roger Wicker (MS).

Collins spoke during the brief debate and vote, saying she supported additional construction at the border.

Several GOP senators declined to vote.

Trump will likely veto the resolution, and the 54 votes in favor are not enough to overcome the president’s veto.

Trump announced the emergency in February after Democrats blocked the funding for the border wall. Trump’s emergency declaration uses powers that prior Congresses voted to give to the president."

The Atlanta Fed’s Business Expectations survey showed expectations for growth in capital spending rising for the third consecutive month. The gauge is at the highest level recorded in the five-year life of the survey.

The composite index for business expectations declined, largely due to a sharp decline in expectations for growth in employment. This is likely a reflection of the tightness of the labor market that has led many businesses to say they are having trouble finding workers to fill open positions. In August, the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent for the third month in a row, and the number of unemployed persons was essentially unchanged at 6.0 million.

Expectations for sales growth also dipped slightly.

The ongoing improvement in expectations for capital spending could indicate improving economic conditions. In its most recent statement, the Federal Reserve pointed to lower levels of business investment in recent months as a source of sluggishness in the U.S. economy.

The Survey’s Business Uncertainty index also declined in September to its lowest level since March. The uncertainty index climbed in the second and third quarter this year as global growth slowed and on-and-off again talks with China clouded the path of trade policies."

The oversubscription is an indication that the stress on the repo market has not lifted despite the central bank’s intervention, now in its seventh day.

The Fed has been intervening in the repo market, which provides short-term funding vital to the largest Wall Street banks, ever since interest rates spiked on at the start of last week. The cause of the interest rate spike remains a matter of speculation. The most popular theory on Wall Street is that the Fed’s earlier balance sheet reduction has left the market with toor few dollars relative to Treasuries held by financial institutions.

The repo market is at the center of the U.S. financial system but it is little understood even by most people working in finance.

The word repo is short for repurchase. In a repo, one party sells another a security while promising to buy it back at a later date, often the very next day. The repurchase price is a bit higher than the initial sale, creating a positive return for the cash provider. Although technically structured as sales and repurchases, essentially what’s going on here is the creation of short-term loans collateralized with Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt. The higher repurchase price is equivalent to earning interest on the loan.

Big Wall Street banks borrow cash to finance their trading activity, for themselves and for clients, by selling securities and promising to buy them back the following day. The cash comes from investors with lots of dollars looking to make a little extra interest, such as money-market funds and government-sponsored housing agencies such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan banks. Typically, the interest rate on repos falls within the Fed’s target range for the fed funds rate, the rate banks pay to borrow reserves from each other.

Here’s how it works. Each morning, traders at the big Wall Street firms put in bids to borrow cash and cash investors accept bids. The bids are promises to pay an interest rate and a pledge to post securities as collateral. Later the day, the securities get allocated to the cash investors. The following day, the repos get unwound in the morning. The cash investors get their cash back and the Wall Street banks get their securities back. Then it starts all over again.

Why do the big Wall Street banks fund themselves this way? It’s really just a more intense version of the basic model of banking: borrow short-term, lend long-term, and make your profit on the difference between the rates.

Usually, the repo process is nearly seamless. Most of the previous day’s trades just get rolled over into the next day’s repos, with a slight tinkering of the rates and slight shifts in the collateral.

But the market started to malfunction last Monday, with the implied interest rate rising far above the Fed Funds target. Ever since, the Fed has intervened to hold the rate down. It now seems increasingly likely that this will become a permanent feature of the market."

The data shows U.S. companies asked for 20,000 H-1B workers in 15 career tracks during 2017, and likely received 8,000 of the requested lower-wage workers.

Robert Heath, a programmer in Boynton Beach, Florida, compared the pay promised for the 8,000 imported H-1Bs to the higher pay which is already being earned by Americans who are working in those careers in Atlanta.

The promised pay is described in the “Labor Condition Application” document filed by H-1B employers at the Department of Labor. The Americans’ pay is tracked by the Bureau of Labor Standards.

The comparison showed that promised wages for the 8,000 H-1Bs are far below the wages paid to Americans with average skills.

The LCA-to-BLS payroll gap amounted to $355 million per year, said Heath, who runs H1Bfacts.com.

But only 40 percent of the visa requests get an H-1B worker for the employers, so the estimated payroll gap drops to $140 million.

But the H-1B program allows employers to keep their H-1B workers for six years. So the six-year payroll gap for the 8,000 workers imported in 2017 balloons to almost $840 million.

Advocates for the H-1B program say it is needed to fill “highly skilled” jobs because not enough Americans have the required skills.

Opponents say education data and the slow growth of graduates’ salaries nationwide show there is no shortage of skilled Americans, and that skilled Americans are losing job opportunities and salaries to imported visa-workers. Americans lose the jobs because executives and recruiters in the overlapping networks of subcontracting firms have their own financial incentives to hire visa workers for jobs instead of American graduates, say critics.

If the 8,000 H-1Bs are supposed to get jobs that would be otherwise be sought by highly skilled and highly paid Americans, then Georgia’s annual payroll gap jumps to $470 million, according to Heath’s analysis of the federal data.

Over six years, the payroll gap from these 8,000 workers would take $2.8 billion from spending by high skilled Americans on Georgia retailers and restaurants, apartment rentals and furniture sellers, auto dealers and gas stations — and also from the state and local tax collectors who fund schools and road construction.

If the total loss is only $300 million per year, the outsourcing slices half a percent from the state’s total economy.

That payroll loss an unwanted problem for Georgia politicians, including Sen. David Perdue.

Perdue is now blocking a bill by Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee that could dramatically increase the payroll loss caused by the cheap visa-workers imported into the United States. The bill should be delayed until legislators can study the impact more, Perdue said.

Lee’s bill would remove the “country caps” on the award of green cards. Those caps now limit the ability of allied U.S. and Indian firms to recruit Indian graduates for jobs currently held by American graduates. Lee’s bill would give the CEOs up to 140,00o green cards each year which they can grant as no-cost deferred bonus payments to the Indians who accept low wages in the American jobs.

The left-wing West Coast investors who formed the FWD.us lobbying group are signaling their opposition to Perdue’s pro-American position, via their Georgia representative:

Georgia's tech economy thrives with immigrants. If we are to remain the #1 state in which to do business and keep Atlanta the technology capital of the east coast maybe @sendavidperdue should rethink his passions for cutting legal immigration by 50% #gapol https://t.co/LQDs4odHsG — Sam Aguilar (@SamAguilarATL) September 24, 2019

Mark Zuckerberg, the main funder for FWD.us, is pushing the S.386 bill. He met with Sen. Lee on September 19 — the day when Perdue blocked his green card giveaway bill.

Other states are also losing payroll because of imported, lower-wage H-1B workers. Heath’s data suggests that three states of Kentucky, Utah, and Missouri lose from $500 million up to $1.7 billion in payroll each year. Nationwide, if each of the roughly 800,000 resident H-1Bs is paid just $5,000 less than the Americans they replace, the program chops payroll by $4 billion.

Heath says his data understates the economic loss to Georgia businesses in the local Chambers of Commerce, to retail and real-estate rents, and to the tax receipts earned by state and local governments.

Federal agencies, including the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, hide much of the data, said Heath. Also, he did not calculate the payroll loss for all visa workers in Georgia because, “it would have taken me a month to do it … I am trying to get an order of magnitude approximation.”

The analysis covers 20,000 of the 35,000 H-1B visa requests submitted in 2017, he said. He roughly 15,000 visa requests from many small-scale career tracks, he said. This focus excluded roughly 6,000 H-1B workers who were moved into Georgia’s jobs in 2017, he said.

Companies use the H-1B rules to sideline skilled Americans — often by hiring H-1Bs who are so untrained they must be trained by the Americans who are being fired.

The LCA data shows that 63 percent of the 20,000 visa requests in Georgia were for workers assigned to the lowest of four skill categories, Heath said. Only 17 percent of the requests declared they were seeking workers with skill levels of 3 or 4, he said. The requests said that 63 percent were for levels 1 and 2, marked for “Entry Level” and “Qualified” graduates.

The result is that 62 percent of the request workers were promised salaries of below $80,000. Another 22 percent were promised wages between $80,000 and $100,000, leaving just 16 percent with promised wages above $100,000.

The data is available at SAITJ.org, which also links to H-1B data in the other states and every House district.

Heath said his estimate is also understated because he cannot track the money diverted by fraud and corruption in the visa-worker programs.

More than two-thirds of the imported H-1B workers are from India. Their payroll can be less than the promised payroll because some Indian managers refuse to pay them while they are unemployed or “benched” for weeks or months until the U.S.-based Indian recruiters slot them into new jobs ahead of Americans. Also, many H-1B workers are forced to pay under-the-table payment to their employers because they prefer to work in the United States than back home in India. This month, an Indian company owner was sentenced to seven years in jail for at least 250 cases of H-1B fraud, according to a September 23 article in the Seattle Times:

Pradyumna Kumar Samal, the former CEO of two companies, Divensi and Azimetry, which supplied workers to tech companies including Microsoft and Amazon, used fraudulent and forged documents to get H-1B visas, according to his plea agreement. The documents made it appear the workers had jobs to go to, when in fact they did not. … Workers brought to the U.S. by Samal paid a partially refundable “security deposit” of as much as $5,000 regardless of whether they ever got paying jobs, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle. … Samal got visas for workers before having job offers in order to have a pool of talent at the ready, according to court documents. It was a “short cut,” Samal said in a letter to the judge, one aimed at growing his business.

Also, H-1B workers are migrants, and many send some of their wages back to their homes, including to their extended families in India.

Indian-run companies also import many additional visa workers who are allowed to work under the B1, L-1, H4EAD, or Optional Practical Training programs.

Workers imported via the B-1 program received Indian wages, while L-1 workers can be paid at state-set minimum wages. Many of the OPT workers are kept in sweatshops, and accept low wages in the hope of getting promoted into the H-1B program so they can get green cards.

More than 800,000 Indian graduates work in the U.S. white-collar jobs sought by U.S. graduates. The Indians also transfer the work performed by at least two million additional white-collar Americans back to the Indians’ parent companies in India.

The payroll loss is important because Lee’s pending bill could dramatically swell the number of Indians working in U.S. jobs.

The bill — S.386 — that would reward Indian college-graduates with more green cards if they agree to take jobs from American graduates, via the uncapped OPT, B1, L-1, H4EAD, and H-1B visa programs.

Current “country caps” allow Indians CEOs to provide roughly 20,000 green-cards per year to their Indian workers and family members, instead of salaries.

But the S.386 bill, being pushed by GOP Utah Sen. Mike Lee, would allow Indian CEOs to recruit even more Indian graduates for U.S. jobs because it would enable the Indian — and U.S. CEOs — to offer up to 140,000 green-cards to Indian workers and family members each year.

India’s population is huge, so there are millions of Indians who could rationally take U.S jobs at low wages to compete for the CEOs’ bonus of 100,000 green cards per year.

The green cards are immensely valuable to Indians because they would allow the Indians –plus their immediate and extended families, and all of their descendants — to leave caste-ridden, poor India to become U.S. citizens.

Indian CEOs already violate visa rules to import cheap workers for competitive advantage.

On September 19, the Department of Homeland Security described large-scale visa B1 and H-1B fraud by Indian managers at a prestigious Indian company in Chicago, Mu Sigma:

Mu Sigma – a large, advanced analytics service provider headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with its main delivery center in Bangalore, India – was illegally circumventing U.S. government H-1B visa regulations by actively employing B1 visitor visa holders under contract within the U.S. In addition, the company’s invitation letters for the B1 visa holders misrepresented the nature of the B1 visitors’ intended business. Furthermore, company officials illegally instructed potential B1 business visitors and company handlers how to avoid detection by U.S. authorities. …. Mu Sigma B1 visa holders who were illegally working in the United States were also paid in India at India-based wages, which are substantially lower than their U.S. counterparts. This unlawful employment tactic greatly increased Mu Sigma’s profit margins and the company’s ability to provide low bids for end-user contracts. … This investigation identified about 400 potential B1 visa violators, and more than 300 instances of illegal visa bond contracts, during the defined five-year statute of limitations. Investigating special agents also identified nine Mu Sigma executives and managers who actively participated in these schemes.

Federal data reveals how the H-1B program sucks billions of payroll $$$ from heartland states and cities, & sends it to Wall St investors. Eg, Kentucky loses $100M to $400M per year in payroll. GOP Senate votes today on @S386 to increase the payroll loss. https://t.co/8IJMQWcjqP — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 19, 2019

A growing number of lawsuits allege that fraud and anti-American discrimination are endemic throughout the Indian economy within the United States. “Based on your time in the U.S., you have basically defrauded everyone you could defraud,” the judge told the Indian CEO as he sentenced him to seven years in jail.

A 2018 survey even reported widespread caste-related discrimination by Indian elites against Indians in the United States, according to an NPR report:

This survey provides data for what many in the community already know: any time there’s a dominant population of South Asians — whether they’re living in Silicon Valley or New Jersey, or working at an office or a restaurant — caste biases emerge. It could be anything from refusing to date or marry someone from a lower caste, to being on the receiving end of a casteist slur, to being made to sit separately because of your perceived “untouchability.” “We have people who responded who were in the assembly lines for a Campbell soup factory in Central Valley, as well as people who work for Google, Facebook and the other big tech companies,” Soundararajan said, naming workplaces that employ large numbers of South Asians.

DHS exposes trafficking of Indian graduates to US jobs via B1 & H-1B visas. Smuggled B1s are paid Indian wages so they help Indian CEOs grab white-collar jobs from US grads & companies. Crappy jobs for you & your kids if @SenMikeLee's @S386 becomes law. https://t.co/xfsR99hn3O — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 23, 2019

Fraud and discrimination is the norm among major Indian-run companies in the United States, say critics:

But where does the diverted Georgia payroll go?

Most of the gains are sent from Georgia to Wall Street investors in New York and California.

For example, Walmart is boosting its stock value by outsourcing 569 finance and accounting jobs in North Carolina to cheaper H-1B workers from India. If the company saves $10,000 per employee, Walmart will save $5.7 million per year. On Wall Street, Walmart’s price to earnings rate is 25 to one, so the $5.7 million in payroll savings will boost its stockholders’ value by $142 million.

Walmart picked an American company, Genpact, to supply the Indian workers. The company is a spin-off of General Electric, and it prospers by providing Indian H-1B workers to many companies in the United States. For example, the company asked for 271 H-1Bs in 2018, 410 H-1Bs in 2017, and 307 H-1Bs in 2016.

Genpact’s H-1Bs work on the U.S. side of the vast and growing U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, now worth roughly $78 billion per year. Part of the H-1Bs’ job is to funnel additional work back into India. For example, Genpact may only need to use 100 H-1Bs in North Carolina to help steer the work of the 569 fired American finance experts back to large teams of low-wage Indian graduates in India.

Genpact’s $3.3 billion in revenue is enough to generate $7.5 billion in stock value for its investors, which include Bain Capital, Blackrock, and Charles Schwab Investment Management.

The investors are mostly based on the coasts, so their wealth is helping to spike wages and real-estate values in New York and California — while the reduced payroll in Georgia, Kentucky, Utah, Missouri reduces business income and drops real-estate values in the heartland states."

American servicemen are enjoying a period of drastically decreased unemployment, fueled by the economic stability of a strong post-2008 economy. Last year, both male and female veterans showed a significantly lower jobless rate than their non-veteran counterparts: 3.5 percent against 3.7 percent for men, and 3 percent versus 4 percent for women.

As of 2017, male veterans drew a median of about $51,000 in annual income, versus $40,000 for their civilian counterparts. For women, the salary difference stood at $41,000 over $30,000.

Of course, many veterans struggle to adjust to a lifestyle outside of their time in the armed forces. That is where organizations like Volunteers of America come in: “I think it’s important to note that most veterans come back, re-acclimate, go back to work and do quite well in the civilian life,” said Barbara Banaszynski, a VOA senior vice president of the group’s veterans’ programs.

“The majority of those veterans, with a little bit of concentrated help, are able to resume lives in the community, hold jobs and stand and move forward,” said Banaszynski. And when they cannot, even mega-corporations like Google have begun to step in.

One such measure is a “Grow with Google” utility that allows veterans to find careers using their military occupational specialty code. Banaszynski also applauded companies like Home Depot and Bank of America for making veterans a cornerstone of employee recruitment.

Still, problems persist. Complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by the veteran population jumped 47 percent in 2016 alone. Inaccurate credit reports, credit cards, and unpaid debt top the concerns.

“We regularly hear from servicemembers who are worried that incorrect information on their credit reports will put their security clearance, duty status, potential promotion, or even military career in jeopardy,” wrote the CFPB’s Office of Servicemember Affairs in its 2018 annual report.

Still, veteran poverty rates remain lower than the general population: In 2017, service member poverty stood at 6.4 percent while the non-military rate was hovering at 10.9 percent. President Trump has taken a personal hand in the issue, having signed an executive order in August that forgave 50,000 veteran student loans."

Perhaps Neumann’s biggest transgression has been his handling of WeWork’s delayed initial public offering, with reports swirling in recent days that the company is considering drastically cutting its valuation.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Tuesday that Adam Neumann has been forced to step down and cede control of the shared-office-space company. The report, which cited anonymous sources who are “familiar with the matter,” said Neumann will take on the role of non-executive chairman.

A separate report from CNBC quoted a statement from Neumann: “While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive.”

CNBC reported that SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son, who has invested billions of dollars in WeWork, led the effort to oust Neumann.

Neumann co-founded WeWork in 2010, helping to turn the start-up into a millennial-focused juggernaut. But reports have depicted him as an erratic leader who engaged in bizarre behavior more suited to a frat house than a public company.

The Journal reported that Neumann was once forced off a private flight after crew members found a cereal box filled with marijuana.

Neumann also reportedly received $5.9 million from WeWork for use of the word “we” when the company rebranded itself as The We Company in anticipation of the IPO. He eventually returned the money following widespread criticism.

WeWork delayed its IPO in September after tepid investor response.

Reuters reported the company may seek a valuation between $10 billion and $12 billion, down sharply from the $47 billion valuation it achieved earlier this year.

It has been a wild day for stocks. Initially, the major indexes opened up but headed down after consumer confidence fell by more than expected and rumors that House Democrats were planning to impeach President Trump began spreading during the president’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly. Stocks took another downward jag when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office said she would make an announcement on impeachment at 5 p.m. Tuesday.

But they bounced back after President Trump’s tweet on the transcript.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been down by more than 200 points at the low of the day, was down just 96 points, 0.36 percent, about twenty minutes after the Zelensky transcript tweet. The S&P 500 halved its losses for the day."

During his address to the United Nations on Tuesday, Trump blasted globalist politicians from both political establishments for enabling China’s entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) and subsequently overlooked trade abuses.

“In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization. Our leaders then argued that this decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us and for private property and for the Rule of Law,” Trump said. “Two decades later, this theory has been tested and proven completely wrong.”

“The World Trade Organization needs drastic change,” Trump continued. “The second-largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a developing country in order to game the system at others’ expense.”

“For years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored, or even encouraged,” Trump said. “Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests.”

Under his administration, Trump said China is finally being confronted on the massive decades-long trade imbalance where huge tariffs have been placed on American exports to China, while Chinese goods are readily imported with little to no tariffs.

“But as far as America is concerned, those days are over,” Trump declared. “To confront these unfair practices, I placed massive tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese-made goods. Already, as a result of these tariffs, supply chains are relocating back to America and to other nations, and billions of dollars are being paid to our treasury.”

Thanks to Trump’s implementation of tariffs, China’s economic growth has slowed to its weakest pace since 1992, as Breitbart News reported, and experts say major companies are being forced to relocate outside of China.

For decades, free trade has helped gut working and middle-class U.S. jobs and stripped whole middle American towns of their industries and livelihoods. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed and China was allowed to enter the WTO, nearly five million American manufacturing jobs and more than 50,000 manufacturing facilities have been eliminated from the U.S. economy. This mass elimination of jobs due to free trade has coincided with an almost 600 percent increase in trade deficits.

CNBC reports that recently unsealed court documents provide more context around a lawsuit filed by Tesla investors against the firm. The documents were published by legal transparency advocates PlainSite and show that shareholders are accusing Tesla of improperly valuing its $2.6 billion acquisition of the solar power company SolarCity in 2016, providing flawed analysis and misleading investors.

The lawsuit which was filed in 2016 just adds to Musk’s legal issues, which include a lawsuit from Walmart against Tesla over claims that the firms solar panels caused fires at multiple Walmart locations, at least two wrongful death lawsuits filed against Tesla after drivers died while using the firms Autopilot system, and a defamation lawsuit against Musk personally from British cave diver Vern Unsworth who Musk accused of being a pedophile on Twitter.

The court documents outline a tangled relationship between Musk’s firms Tesla and SpaceX where he is CEO and SolarCity where he was the largest shareholder and chairman. The documents claim that: “Prior to the Acquisition, Musk described Tesla, SolarCity, and SpaceX as a ‘pyramid’ atop which he sat; it was ‘important that there not be some sort of house of cards that crumbles if one element of the pyramid . . . falters.’”

Shareholders state that Musk had previously invested SpaceX money in SolarCity, which was hidden from auditors Ernst & Young before Tesla acquired the firm. The brief states that SpaceX invested $1654 million into SolarCity as non-recourse bonds and it was not disclosed to E&Y how quickly they would be forced to make two large payments related to these bonds back to SpaceX.

CNBC outlined Musk’s personal relationship to members of SolarCity stating:

In addition, the brief claims that a majority of Tesla board members had financial interests on both sides at the time of the deal and wanted to see SolarCity bailed out rather than bankrupted in order to protect their own reputations, and their bets on other companies where Musk was and is still CEO.

For example, Elon and Kimbal Musk, Antonio Gracias, and Steve Jurvetson were all Tesla board members at the time of the SolarCity acquisition and were early backers of and board members at SpaceX. Ira Ehrenpreis, a long-time Tesla board member, held a board seat at SolarCity after funding it via his venture firm, Technology Partners. Kimbal Musk is Elon Musk’s brother. And Lyndon and Peter Rive, co-founders of SolarCity, are first cousins of Elon and Kimbal Musk.

The LA Times report on the documents points out that the suit argues that Musk’s private company, SpaceX, played major role in propping up SolarCity:

In a further entanglement, another Musk company, the privately financed SpaceX, had loaned money to SolarCity to help keep the solar panel company’s cash position from dipping below $169 million, an event that would have triggered a bond default and possibly led to bankruptcy.

Tesla commented on the shareholder’s lawsuit to CNBC stating:

These allegations are based on the claims of plaintiff’s lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders who support our mission and ultimately voted in favor of the acquisition. The accusations made in the plaintiff’s brief are false and misleading, as Tesla and SolarCity published all material information in its proxy and other public filings for all shareholders to consider before deciding on the transaction. Providing clean, renewable energy generation through solar has been a critical part of our mission ever since 2006, and our acquisition of SolarCity has enabled and continues to enable a significantly faster path to achieve our goals.

The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell in September to a reading of 125.1, down from 134.2 in August. Economists had been expecting a much shallower dip to 133. The guage was sharply up in July.

Both views of current business and labor market conditions and short-term outlooks for income, business and labor market conditions declined in September.

“The escalation in trade and tariff tensions in late August appears to have rattled consumers. ,” said Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. “However, this pattern of uncertainty and volatility has persisted for much of the year and it appears confidence is plateauing.”

The share of consumers claiming business conditions are “good” fell from 40.9 percent to 37.3 percent, while those saying business conditions are “bad” rose from 9.9 percent to 12.7 percent. Consumers’ assessment of the job market also soured somewhat. Those saying jobs are “plentiful” declined from 50.3 percent to 44.8 percent, while those claiming jobs are “hard to get” also declined slightly from 12.0 percent to 11.6 percent."

The N.Y. Fed added $75 billion in overnight funding. Banks bid for $80.2 billion, $5.2 billion more than the Fed made available.

The N.Y. Fed also added $30 billion in a two-week repo operation maturing October 8. This offer received $62 billion of bids, more than twice the offer. The Fed said this was the first of three two-week repo offerings planned for this week.

The fact that both operations were oversubscribed dashed any hopes that Monday’s smaller amount of demand signaled an easing of stress in the short-term funding market.

The Fed has been intervening in the repo market, which provides short-term funding vital to the largest Wall Street banks, ever since interest rates spiked on Monday. The cause of the interest rate spike remains a matter of speculation. The most popular theory on Wall Street is that the Fed’s earlier balance sheet reduction has left the market with too few dollars relative to Treasuries held by financial institutions.

The repo market is at the center of the U.S. financial system but it is little understood even by most people working in finance.

The word repo is short for repurchase. In a repo, one party sells another a security while promising to buy it back at a later date, often the very next day. The repurchase price is a bit higher than the initial sale, creating a positive return for the cash provider. Although technically structured as sales and repurchases, essentially what’s going on here is the creation of short-term loans collateralized with Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt. The higher repurchase price is equivalent to earning interest on the loan.

Big Wall Street banks borrow cash to finance their trading activity, for themselves and for clients, by selling securities and promising to buy them back the following day. The cash comes from investors with lots of dollars looking to make a little extra interest, such as money-market funds and government-sponsored housing agencies such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan banks. Typically, the interest rate on repos falls within the Fed’s target range for the fed funds rate, the rate banks pay to borrow reserves from each other.

Here’s how it works. Each morning, traders at the big Wall Street firms put in bids to borrow cash and cash investors accept bids. The bids are promises to pay an interest rate and a pledge to post securities as collateral. Later the day, the securities get allocated to the cash investors. The following day, the repos get unwound in the morning. The cash investors get their cash back and the Wall Street banks get their securities back. Then it starts all over again.

Why do the big Wall Street banks fund themselves this way? It’s really just a more intense version of the basic model of banking: borrow short-term, lend long-term, and make your profit on the difference between the rates."

Just as 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts.

“Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the declaration states. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.”

The scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.

“There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.”

The signatories of the declaration also insist that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable frenzy of the day.

“There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,” they note. “We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.”

“If better approaches emerge, and they certainly will, we have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world,” they state.

In particular, the scientists criticize the general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is currently founded as “unfit for their purpose.”

“Therefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models,” they propose. “Current climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power.”

“We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation,” they declare.

An annually released report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimates that that illegal population living in the U.S. has risen nearly two million in two years, now standing at about 14.3 million illegal aliens.

FAIR analysts fault the increase in illegal aliens to an unsecured southern border, growing sanctuary city policies, widespread available U.S. jobs with no nationwide E-Verify mandate, an increase in social welfare programs, exploitable asylum laws, and the ongoing promise of amnesty by GOP and Democrat lawmakers.

The rise in the illegal population, FAIR analysts find, means illegal aliens are costing American taxpayers nearly $132 billion every year. That fiscal burden to Americans is set to grow even larger without major immigration-reducing reforms, according to the study.

“Unless the federal government takes meaningful action to eliminate the incentives that fuel illegal immigration, the total number of illegal aliens residing in the United States could surge to over 21 million by 2025, at a cost of nearly $200 million, annually,” FAIR analysts project.

The FAIR study is among many that have attempted to estimate the illegal population living in the U.S. Researchers from Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have estimated an illegal population of 22 million, while Pew Research Center regularly cites an illegal population of 11 to 12 million.

As noted previously, the FAIR study confirms that the illegal population is largely concentrated in six states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois — four of which are sanctuary states where criminal illegal aliens are shielded from deportation.

California, for example, is home to more than three million illegal aliens with the broadest sanctuary state policy in the country. Texas has an illegal population of more than two million, and Florida is home to nearly 1.1 million illegal aliens despite both outlawing sanctuary city jurisdictions.

The sanctuary states of New York, New Jersey, and Illinois have a combined illegal population of about 2.22 million.

Illegal immigration is not only fiscally burdensome on American taxpayers to the sum of billions every year, but an increase of foreign workers in the U.S. labor market due to legal immigration levels — where about 1.2 million immigrants are admitted every year — reduces the wages of America’s working and middle class. Conversely, less immigration increases Americans’ wages.

Extensive research by economist George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota reveals that the country’s current mass legal immigration system burdens working and middle class Americans while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth every year to major employers and newly arrived immigrants. Similarly, immigration keeps wages low for employers and stagnant for employees.

For every one-percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers’ occupations, their weekly wages are cut by about 0.5 percent, Camarota finds. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.75 percent.

Today, about 17.5 percent of the American workforce is made up of foreign-born workers. About 7.8 million of these foreign-born workers are illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to the latest analysis by Pew Research Center.

Melania Trump greeted schoolchildren in a sleeveless black Prada dress featuring a matching belt and giant front flap pockets — a signature of the Italian brand.

Most notably, Mrs. Trump wore a pair of patent leather buckle pumps by Rogier Vivier, the French designer who famously slipped his stilettos on Catherine Deneuve for her role in Belle de Jour. The ensemble is a kind of modern spin on Deneuve’s mod wardrobe from the 1967 film.

Mrs. Trump originally wore these Roger Vivier heels with a black Christian Dior coat while visiting France on her European tour this summer, loyal Fashion Notes readers will recall.

The official announcement said the new Mac Pro will begin production “soon” at the same Austin facility where Mac Pro has been made since 2013.

Apple’s decision comes following pressure from President Donald Trump, who said Apple wouldn’t receive a tariff waiver or relief for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Those parts would be imported for assembly in the U.S.

On Monday, Apple said that it has received a federal product exclusion “for certain necessary components,” but didn’t mention China by name. The exclusion is expected to allow Apple to import the parts without paying tariffs on them.

“The Mac Pro is Apple’s most powerful computer ever and we’re proud to be building it in Austin. We thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,” Cook said in the announcement.

Apple continues to make its popular products like the iPhone in China.

The company said Monday that the new Mac Pro will include components designed, developed and manufactured by more than a dozen American companies. It said the value of American-made components in the new Mac Pro is 2.5 times greater than in Apple’s previous generation Mac Pro.

In June, Apple was reportedly ready to move production of the new Mac Pro from the U.S. to China. The news came amid escalating trade tensions between the two countries, with Trump threatening new tariffs.

But following pressure from Trump, Cook indicated in July that he wanted to keep making the Mac Pro computer in the U.S.

The Mac Pro is marketed toward professional users and is priced at $6,000 for starters.

In an article titled “Snap Detailed Facebook’s Aggressive Tactics in ‘Project Voldemort’ Dossier,” the Wall Street Journal outlines how Snap Inc.’s legal team compiled a dossier of Facebook’s aggressive business tactics titled “Project Voldemort.” This information comes to light as the FTC has begun contacting dozens of tech executives and app developers as part of an investigation into startups that became defunct after losing access to Facebook’s platform, as well as those who sold their company to Facebook.

The WSJ writes:

The files in Voldemort, a reference to the fictional antagonist in the popular Harry Potter children’s books, chronicled Facebook’s moves that threatened to undermine Snap’s business, including discouraging popular account holders, or influencers, from referencing Snap on their Instagram accounts, according to people familiar with the project. Executives also suspected Instagram was preventing Snap content from trending on its app, the people said.

The FTC’s actions appear to show that the firm is attempting to determine if Facebook has displayed a pattern of behavior that prevents competition to Facebook’s main business model. Within Facebook, many are reportedly worried about what rivals could be telling the FTC, according to the WSJ:

Inside Facebook, senior leaders are concerned about the possibility of rivals divulging damaging information to federal officials and have discussed ways to improve the company’s relationships around Silicon Valley, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The FTC investigation is one of several antitrust probes into Facebook and major tech giants in the U.S. and around the world. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee requested Facebook executive communications about the company’s decisions to buy the photo- and video-sharing network Instagram in 2012 and the messaging app WhatsApp in 2014. Lawmakers have contacted several of those companies’ rivals as part of that probe, the Journal reported previously.

The WSJ notes that one key area of focus is Onavo, an Israeli mobile-analytics startup that was purchased by Facebook in 2013. The app described itself as a way to “keep you and your data safe” by providing a free virtual private network which redirected internet traffic through Facebook servers allowing the firm to log every action by users in its central database. The WSJ writes:

Snap was founded in 2011, when Facebook was already the dominant player in social media. It quickly became a social-media hit after its Snapchat messaging app took off among young people. At one point, Facebook—through Onavo—was able to see Snap data as specific as the number of messages a user sent or how much time those users spent in specific Snapchat features, the former employees said. Facebook couldn’t see the content of the messages or images. The visibility into Snap usage lessened considerably after Snap encrypted its app traffic.

Multiple instances — one of which involved a student hightailing it across campus with a stolen pro-First Amendment sign — were caught on video.

It appears that students at UMBC have decided to take it upon themselves to enforce the “free speech zone” policies on UMBC’s campus, according to multiple videos that have surfaced showcasing yet more examples of ways in which some students react to conservatives at universities today.

The term “free speech zone” refers to when university administrators designate a specific area on a college campus for one to exercise their First Amendment rights, which in turn, seems to have given students the false narrative that the United States of America in itself is not a “free speech zone.”

While recruiting students on UMBC’s campus, TPUSA northeast regional manager Taylor Cisinski had several of his promotional materials stolen, to which Cisinski reacted by following after the students in an attempt to retrieve his signs and posters, while filming the occurrences.

In one video, a male student can be seen running across campus with a stolen TPUSA sign that read, “Free Speech Has No Zone in America.”

Watch below:

“Can I have my sign back?” Cisinski can be heard saying to the student in the video, after catching up to him. “If it was a socialist table, I wouldn’t take their stuff.”

In a second video, another male student appears to assault the TPUSA activist while he is filming inside a student center in pursuit of a third student who had stolen a stack of posters.

Watch below:

“Do not touch me,” the TPUSA activist can be heard saying in the beginning of the video while a male student is seen extending one arm toward the camera, causing the camera to lose focus. Cisinski then follows after another student who is seen walking away with several posters.

“Can I have my posters back?” said Cisinski to the student after catching up with her. “That’s pretty fascist, taking people’s stuff, shutting down their free speech.”

“Oh shit, oh my God, I’ve always wanted to be in one of these,” said the student upon realizing that she was being filmed, likely in reference to the plethora of videos that have surfaced on the Internet, which showcase leftists harassing conservatives on college campuses.

“Why do you think it’s okay to take people’s stuff?” continued Cisinski in the video. “Can I have those back? If it was a socialist table that I disagreed with, I wouldn’t go and be rude and take their stuff.”

“Do you have a right to be here?”

“Yeah, we do,” responded the TPUSA activist. “We paid for that table. We went up to the office. Now can I please have my stuff back?”

“Do you have a permit [to be on public property]?”

“Yes.”

“Oh, somebody told me you didn’t have a permit,” reacted the student, before finally handing Cisinski back his posters.

Last week’s incident involving multiple students stealing TPUSA materials was preceded by an incident one week earlier, in which UMBC administrators told TPUSA activists that they needed permission from the school in order to exercise their First Amendment rights on public property.

“We were told that a group of students put a bounty out on our materials that we were not giving away,” explained Cisinski to Breitbart News. “Throughout the day, we had multiple students coming up and stealing our stuff.”

Cisinski added that before the students began stealing the TPUSA materials, they first attempted to rid the conservative activists from campus by calling security on them. But when calling security was to no avail, the students took matters into their own hands.

“Oftentimes, these leftist students will call us fascist on campus, but then they’ll display those exact tendencies by trying to shut down our political speech and disrupt our events,” said Cisinski. “It was also very ironic that this one student decided to steal our sign supporting freedom of speech.”

“College campuses have created a culture where it’s okay to shut down conservative viewpoints by any means necessary,” he added. “When you constantly label the other side as racist, fascist, and evil, then it becomes okay to act erratic in an effort to silence conservatives.”

During a recent interview with the Financial Times, Google CEO Sundar Pichai expressed his concerns about “rushing” into the regulation of artificial intelligence technology. “It is such a broad cross-cutting technology, so it’s important to look at [regulation] more in certain vertical situations,” Pichai said. “Rather than rushing into it in a way that prevents innovation and research, you actually need to solve some of the difficult problems.”

Pichai acknowledged issues with AI such as algorithmic bias and accountability but still appeared hopeful for the future of the technology. Google has received some backlash to certain AI-driven projects, but overall AI is a huge growth market for the firm. Google’s drone contract with the Department of Defense, Project Maven, was ended following fierce backlash from employees. Thousands signed a petition to have the firm end the program as many felt that it was unethical for Google to use AI in a military application. In March, Google allowed the contract to lapse.

But AI continues to be a future growth area for all of Silicon Valley, and Google in particular. During a first-quarter earnings call this year, Pichai stated that almost three-quarters of Google’s advertising clients were using automated ad technologies which utilized machine learning and artificial intelligence. Given that Google makes the majority of its revenue from advertising, this is an extremely lucrative area for the firm.

Sandra Wachter, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, told Business Insider in an interview that how AI us utilized should change how it is regulated: “I think it makes a lot of sense to look at sectorial regulation rather than just an overarching AI framework,” Wachter said. “Risks and benefits of AI will differ depending on the sector, the application, and the context. For example, AI used in criminal justice will pose different challenges than AI used in the health sector. It is crucial to assess if all the laws are fit for purpose.”

Former Google engineer Laura Nolan who was recruited to Project Maven and resigned over ethical concerns stated: “Algorithmic decision-making is definitely an area that I believe the US needs to regulate. Another major area seems to be automated biometric-based identification (i.e., facial recognition but also other biometrics like gait recognition and so on). These are areas where we see clear problems emerging due to new technological capabilities, and not to regulate would be to knowingly allow harms to occur.”

Nolan added: “The use of AI in warfare absolutely needs to be regulated — it is brittle and unpredictable, and it would be very dangerous to build weapons that use AI to perform the critical function of target selection.”

The “Hannity” host called the move “a huge favor” for Trump.

What we have, though, at the root of all this is an irrational hatred — Trump rage,” Hannity said. “It is all this party, the Democratic Party, now stands for today. And I will predict tonight, they have done Donald Trump a huge favor. It will all backfire and blow up right in their face. Speaker-in-name-only, Nancy Pelosi, she was forced to cave to a radical base that announced an impeachment inquiry against President Trump. By the way, that’s what we’ve been living through the last three years.”

“Make no mistake: This has nothing to do with Ukraine,” he continued. “This has nothing to do with collusion. This has nothing to do with high crimes and misdemeanors because there are none. This has everything to do with the left’s unyielding, unhealthy, what is an obsessive-compulsive hatred of President Trump. They can’t accept that he won. That was November of 2016. They are still there.”

“And I think they even doubt they can beat him at the ballot box which is why they are trying to do this now,” he added. “He occupies every single conscious thought in their minds. It’s like the moment they make wake up is the moment they fall asleep — Donald Trump lives in the heads of these psychotic Democrats and their friends in the media mob. He kind of lives there rent-free every hour of every second of every day. It is a sickness, but now it’s officially hurting the country as it rules their lives.”

Wallace said, “The fact is that President Trump and his staff have really said quite a lot since Sunday in trying to explain or defend what they did that puts a lot of meat on the bones. The fact that the president says that in that congratulatory phone call with the president-elect at that time of Ukraine, he did talk about Joe Biden. He did talk about Joe Biden and his son and possible corruption and expressed some concern about wanting the Ukrainian president to look into that. We also know, because it was admitted today by Kellyanne Conway, the story that was on the front page of The Washington Post, that the president did ask acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, before he made that phone call in July, to stop the provision of military aid to Ukraine, which had been overwhelmingly passed by Congress that everyone seemed in the government to want and the president said that he wanted it to be stopped.”

He continued, “So the two parts of the basic story here — that the president wanted Biden investigated, and that he had previously stopped aid that had been approved by Congress for Ukraine — those have been confirmed by the administration. The president denies that it was a quid pro quo.”

He added, “It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there’s going to be something here for Congress to investigate, whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don’t know.”

BREMMER: No, but it’s hard to imagine Joe Biden wasn’t aware of it. And I expect that President Obama, if he had known about the reality of this situation, would have probably told Biden, “Get rid of this.

In one of the President’s strongest statements on social media bias yet, Trump argued that social media censorship is incompatible with a free society. He also drew attention to the growing trend of censorship, “canceling,” and blacklisting in general.

“We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control,” said the President. “Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty.”

“A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power, over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say,” he continued.

“A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive and defiant of the will of the people. A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule. Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions and values.”

“In the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.”

“A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people. And a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling or blacklisting their own neighbors.”

Trump’s statements put him at odds with globalist political leaders, who want social media platforms to engage in more censorship, not less. At a summit dubbed the “Christchurch Call for Action” earlier this year, the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, and New Zealand demanded social media platforms clamp down on “violent extremism.”

President Trump’s White House publicly refused to co-sign the call for action.

Censorship and discrimination on the basis of political viewpoint have become widespread across big tech platforms. As Breitbart News revealed earlier this year, Facebook maintains a list of political figures and commentators that it considers potential “hate agents.” And Google-owned YouTube has deliberately reordered its search results in response to ideological complaints from left-wing journalists.

Even the President’s son, Donald Trump Jr., has been affected by big tech censorship — in February, Facebook-owned Instagram deleted a post from Don Jr. about notorious hate crime hoaxster Jussie Smollett. Instagram later claimed the removal was an “error.” More recently, Don Jr. reported that his name and that of the President were not appearing in Instagram search suggestions.

Instagram’s explanation? Another “error.”

Levin lobbied Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to be as aggressive as his House counterparts, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, in the use of subpoena power.

Transcript as follows:

MARK LEVIN, AUTHOR “UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS”: My take is the Biden family is corrupt. My take is that Joe Biden obstructed justice. You want to find obstruction. There it was. My take is that he blackmailed that government to get that prosecutor removed. And not just to protect his son, but to protect his future running for President of the United States.

And you have a massive Democrat scandal here. That’s why the media are conducting themselves the way they are. That’s why the Democrats are trying to turn this insight out to immunize Biden and to attack Trump but it won’t work. You see, Trump came into office a very, very rich man, and he’ll leave office a very, very rich man.

Joe Biden came in a very poor man. And then he left office a very rich man as did his family. Look how the media have covered this. First, we heard that Trump pressured Ukrainian President to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and held up military aid. The Wall Street Journal says, “well, not exactly.” Trump pressured the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, but there was no quid pro quo.

Then, we get the whistle-blower complaint being withheld from Congress. And Nancy Pelosi is very angry about that, that’s great. That takes us to impeachment territory. Justice Department and the DNI say, “No.” There we find out really there is no whistle-blower. There is some guy who heard something or read something but wasn’t in on the President’s conversation.

By the way, I am sick and tired of this President’s conversation with foreign leaders been leaked to the media and Democrats on Capitol Hill. I don’t remember a damn one of those happen at all to Obama or any other President. Our President has to be able to speak to other heads of state without this kind of tyranny taking place.

Now, Ukraine, through their foreign minister, denies that Trump pressured them. But you see it doesn’t fit their narrative. Now, let’s take a look at what took place with Biden. By the way, we need a Special Counsel. I have an idea. We should appoint a Special Counsel and make sure all the assistant special councils either donated to the Trump campaign or worked into the Trump campaign because only then will we have an honest investigation.

Make sure the issue of really thick report. That’s what they should to do. Exhibit one, our buddy Peter Schweizer, this is April 16, 2014, Devin Archer Hunter Biden’s business partner made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with the Vice President Biden. Five days later, Biden landed in Kia for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials.

Soon thereafter, the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund found more than a billion dollars into the Ukrainian economy. The next day a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, the fist went Hunter Biden would join the board. Hunter Biden has no background in energy, no background in anything really, other than being the son of a Vice President and other things of that sort.

Now, that’s exhibit one. Exhibit two. This is from The Washington Examiner. John Kerry’s stepson. Oh, it was precious to see John Kerry on TV Sunday attacking Trump, defending Biden when his own stepson has something to answer for it too.

His stepson rushed to play damage control to State Department after his business partner, Hunter Biden sealed the incestuous relationships, cut a deal with oligarch owned Ukrainian Gas Company in 2014, the one we just mentioned. An email released to The Washington Examiner shows that Biden’s decision to join the board of this Ukrainian company sparked immediate concern within his inner circle about the political optics.

Biden’s father, Joe was then Vice President, so they’re very concerned of this point. We have our friend, John Solomon; Biden had made no mention of his son and his 2018 speech that you saw in the video there where he says he stepped in. Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board was rightly reported. So in other words, everybody knew it.

Now, I could go on and on and on. But here’s the deal. Here’s my problem. Where the hell are the Republicans in the Senate? Do you know we control the Senate? Do you know how we control the Senate Intelligence Committee?

Our good friend Lindsey Graham, are you not Chairman to the Senate Judiciary Committee? Then why the hell aren’t you issuing subpoenas like Elijah Cummings? Why the hell aren’t you issuing subpoenas like Jerry Nadler and all the rest of them? Why aren’t you getting to the bottom of this? You have real live corruption, obstruction, blackmail that’s what Ukraine. Wait till we get to China $1.5 Billion. I don’t care what the media thinks. See that over my shoulder? “Unfreedom of the Press”.

We know that they’re incapable of covering this because of their ideology. But the truth shall set us free. I understand what the Democrats are doing in the House. I understand. They want to destroy the President. They are using their committee as opposition research. They are settling the wagon they’re trying to immunize Biden.

What’s going on in the Republican Senate? Subpoenas, under oath testimonies. Why don’t you issue subpoenas for the Biden bank accounts like they do with Trump? Or call in his accounts like they do with Trump? Or Hunter Biden, we can’t touch him but Don, Jr., and Eric and Jerry Kushner and Ivanka? They are free game? Hell, no. We should turn the script. Here’s the difference. Biden is corrupt. Trump is not."

A transcript is as follows:

JOURNALIST: Mr. President, are you happy with the way that Rudy Giuliani has been handling the Ukraine situation? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think he was excellent. I watched a video the other night, I haven’t watched that show [CNN’s ‘Chris Cuomo Tonight’] in a long time. I don’t watch CNN because it’s fake news, but I watched Rudy take apart Fredo [host Chris Cuomo]. Fredo’s performance was incompetent. Rudy took him apart. The press doesn’t give him credit because they take little tiny snippets wherever Rudy was a little bit — if he mispronounces a word they’ll show that, they won’t show the whole [clip]. Rudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners. The first time I’ve watched CNN in a long time. I hate to watch it because it’s so fake. Okay?

The nickname “Fredo” is a reference to a videotaped freakout in which Cuomo threatened a man with physical violence for referring to him as “Fredo” — a term he has claimed was an anti-Italian slur.

“Punk-ass bitches from the right call me ‘Fredo.’ My name is Chris Cuomo. I’m an anchor on CNN,” the host is seen saying in the video shared to a YouTube channel with the title “That’s the Point with Brandon” in August.

The New York Post’s Page Six reported that while CNN’s management was eager to stand behind Cuomo, some in the newsroom were left red-faced by the Cuomo Prime Time host for his flying off the handle.

“Insiders say that — while CNN brass stood by Chris Cuomo after he was caught on camera threatening a man who called him ‘Fredo’ — the newsroom rank and file was “embarrassed by the blowup,” the newspaper reported.

Days after the incident went viral, Cuomo conceded he let the man he berated get the best of him. Cuomo wrote:

Appreciate all the support but – truth is I should be better than the guys baiting me. This happens all the time these days. Often in front of my family. But there is a lesson: no need to add to the ugliness; I should be better than what I oppose.

The nickname “Fredo” was popularized by Breitbart News editor-at-large John Nolte and frequently used by radio host legend Rush Limbaugh."

“We have to ask ourselves, you know, it is relieving, it is cathartic to lash out at that guy on the TV screen,” Acosta told audience members at the Hill Center in Washington, D.C. at an event to promote his book — The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America — according to footage of the event obtained by the Daily Caller on Friday.

Acosta said:

I throw my beer cans at the TV screen too when they’re empty from time to time, but I think we also have to take stock of what we’re doing at home, what we’re doing in our communities. What’s happening in our daily lives that is contributing to this culture of just viciousness? We’ve become a vicious, nasty country.

Acosta, who appeared with longtime progressive radio host Bill Press for the event, then launched into a diatribe in which he claimed he rarely hears Americans discussing the need to make the country better for future generations.

Acosta said:

My concern is, is that we’re tearing each other apart. And this is the country I love, too — my dad as I said earlier came over to this country from Cuba, came over here in 1962, three weeks before the Cuban missile crisis. [They] moved to Northern Virginia, which is where I grew up. There was a Presbyterian church in Vienna, Virginia, that gave my dad and my grandmother coats and sweaters so they could stay warm in their first winter here in the D.C. area. They had never been cold before.

“Are we still that country anymore? Did John F. Kennedy call immigrants rapists and criminals back then? No,” the CNN journalist answered rhetorically in reference to then-candidate Donald Trump’s often misreported June 2015 quip in which he is accused of referring to Mexicans being rapists and criminals.

As a Breitbart News fact-check previously explained, President Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U.S.-Mexico border who commit additional crimes, such as rape — not the entire Mexican population. As Breitbart Texas has documented in depth, human traffickers often “sexually assault or rape the females” traveling to the U.S., and the smugglers are known to “remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree—a rape tree.”

Of course, Acosta is no stranger to making hyperbolic statements or virtue signaling. His frequent outbursts toward President Trump and members of his administration have earned him scorn and mockery from the White House and from some of his establishment media colleagues. In his book, the reporter wrote his abrasive demeanor towards President Trump and other administration officials “bothers some people,” and he admitted to being guilty of “showboating,” even “grandstanding.”

That behavior, especially a heated exchange with the president, infamously landed him a temporary suspension from the White House in November."

Smith said, “There is no known evidence that Joe Biden did anything wrong. The whole thing involved corruption in the Ukraine. A corrupt prosecutor who much of the world was pressuring the Ukraine to remove. Earlier this year the Ukrainian officials said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son, Hunter.”

He added, “The real issue here is a phone call. The claim that the president pressured a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and the failure to pass the whistleblower complaint to Congress. Now, among Democrats, the pressure to impeach this president is building. The top Democrat in Congress, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is warning the White House that refusal to hand over the whistleblower complaint could be a ‘grave new chapter of lawlessness’ by the White House and wrote that it could lead to a whole new stage of the investigation.”

I will go on record as predicting that he will come through this without any meaningful or lasting harm; that he will remain at the helm of Liberty and continue building a remarkable legacy of faith and freedom, one capable of standing up against the prevailing winds of mainstream culture.

Yet this issue has forced me, all over again, to wrestle through a church issue that every Christian must eventually confront.

How should we respond when our brothers and sisters are behaving badly?

For those of us who are Christian, our calling in life transcends our secular obligations. The secular world asks us to conform to a set of rules that are designed to preserve order and civil society. Regardless of any faith or ideology, a sort of mechanical obedience is required and indeed enforced by the rule of law.

Things are not so simple on the Christian side.

Here, the calling is greater and more comprehensive: we are bound by the example that Christ both lived and taught — a bar so high in fact, that only the divine can achieve it. And still we are called to it anyways, a standard much higher than it is for simple, good citizenship. From Protestants to Catholics and Orthodox, we all share the belief that to approach our daily lives rightly means we to ask ourselves: what would Jesus do?

And perhaps nothing is as difficult, or painful, than to watch as the professing faithful behave incongruently with the teachings of Jesus.

Full disclaimer: Jerry Falwell, Jr., has become a personal friend of mine over the past couple of years, and in May I received an honorary doctorate from Liberty at their commencement ceremony. I have the utmost respect for the educational approach and values that emanate from the university’s leadership, and which translate throughout the university.

As someone who travels around the country speaking at universities — large and small, private and public, secular and Christian — I can tell you firsthand that Liberty’s values are values that stand in stark contrast to what the rest of the world is doing.

Clearly not everyone shares my sentiments.

In his interview with The Hill, Fallwell said that documents had been taken from the university for the purpose of causing him and others personal embarrassment. “Our attorneys have determined that this small group of former board members and employees, they’re involved in a criminal conspiracy, are working together to steal Liberty property in the form of emails and provided them to reporters.”

The interview was granted after Politico had published the original story with the headline that should have come complete with a bias alert: “Someone’s gotta tell the freakin’ truth.”

In that piece, a string of accusations were leveled, all attacking Falwell’s integrity. Even the thoroughly discredited perjurer Michael Cohen was cited as saying he “fixed things” for Falwell.

Well, there you have it. If Michael Cohen says he’s bad, he must be, right?

Let me state in the strongest possible terms, without equivocation or qualification, that Jerry Falwell, Jr. is a man of strong and honest character. He is as creative in his role as president as he is generous in his role as a Christian. He is always a leader — whether carrying out Christ’s Great Commission, or helping to keep Franklin’s Republic.

In the Politico article, there is nothing specific about any particular transaction, nor is there even much general context. There are just the same kinds of empty accusations that come from any bitter ex-employee or even any disgruntled secular citizen. In the aftermath of false and sensational accusations made by Jussie Smollet, or aimed at the students of Covington High School, or repeatedly targeting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, it’s high time we view these types of accusations with the high degree of scrutiny and speculation they deserve.

Why do these people resent Jerry Falwell Jr.? Perhaps because of some personal animus, but largely because he’s an outspoken supporter of President Trump. To some people, to support Trump is a bridge too far.

While I am certain they will deny it (in fact, even the Politico article’s author claimed those interviewed were Trump supporters), it is almost certain that politics and President Trump are at the root of their actions. President Trump likely offends their elite sensibilities, and Fllwell’s unabashed support for Trump, based on his record of support for Christian causes, offends them.

I applaud Falwell for not hiding behind a PR firm and trying to do damage control. He faced the reporter head-on and answered the questions asked of him. He will not kowtow to the prevailing media narrative — that to support Trump is evil and an abdication of Christianity’s moral imperative. In fact, Falwell has stated that he believes the exact opposite is true, and that it is his Christian — and American — right to persevere in that conviction despite the predictable pushback.

In bringing in the FBI, Falwell is making a strong, declarative statement that other people in similar positions of power should also make: that he will not be bullied or shamed into hiding.

For many reporters in today’s America, having an opportunity to attack a public supporter of President Trump is of far greater value than real journalism. It is also clickbait that will make many an editor extremely happy. This incident is just the latest example.

Jerry Falwell, Jr. will prevail — for his is a greater calling. As we Christians know from Matthew 5:44, “But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.” Jerry Falwell Jr. will certainly pray, but he will also defend the house and the legacy of his father, and of his heavenly Father.

Fu Guohao claimed to have been seized, kicked, and beaten with umbrellas by demonstrators attending a recent pro-democracy demonstration after they realized he was an undercover reporter. After refusing to show them his press credentials, protesters grabbed his bag and found a T-shirt with the slogan, “I love HK police.”

“Fu Guohao and our other colleagues who have shown outstanding performance in the reporting of Hong Kong [protests] have been awarded. Fu has received the highest award of 100,000 yuan,” Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin wrote on Weibo, China’s state-run equivalent of Twitter.

Speaking at an awards ceremony Sunday, Hu said that Fu had “not been earning much” from his job at the Global Times and had been unable to buy a property in Beijing.

“We jokingly said we hoped the 100,000 yuan would bring him good luck, and that he can buy a flat and be married one day,” said Hu.

The incident took place last month, with the Global Times denouncing the attack as an “act of terrorism” and an attack on freedom of the press, despite China having one of the world’s worst records for freedom of expression.

“The whole newsroom of the Global Times was outraged by rioters treating our reporter in such an inhumane way and strongly condemned the act, which could be considered terrorism,” the outlet wrote in an editorial at the time.

It continued:

We also looked into media reports on the brutality of the mobs and found that some Hong Kong media and Western journalists tried to find an excuse for the brutal act

It’s now become a shame for Hong Kong where these cruel, cold-blooded rioters will attack a defenseless journalist from the mainland, and it is much more wretched for all those Hong Kong media and foreign reporters, who honor freedom of press, to defend such terror-like acts. If they are not accomplices, tell us, what are they?

Hong Kong has been affected by political and civil unrest since early June, when pro-democracy demonstrators began taking to the streets to oppose an extradition bill that would have permitted criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial.

The bill has since been shelved by Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam, although the protests have since merged into wider demonstrations against police brutality, with participants demanding the release of over 1,000 detainees.

The movement is also part of a broader pushback against Beijing’s increasing interference in the region’s internal affairs, undermining the principle of “one country, two systems” that was agreed on following the handover from the British Empire in 1997.

In its zeal to bring down President Trump and hold on to the only part of its customer base that remains — the extreme left — the Times has become what it purports to oppose: a haven of hate for open racists and antisemites

Hiring one racist is an oversight.

Hiring two racists is a mistake.

Hiring three racists is incompetence.

Hiring at least a half-dozen racists is the execution of a deliberate gameplan.

Sometimes you just have to stand back and look at the totality of what is happening in order to fully grasp just how morally corrupted the Times has become… In 2019 America, more than 50 years after the Civil Rights movement, more than 70 years after the Holocaust, here is the roster at what we are told is the premiere news outlet in all of the world:

Jazmine Hughes: Associate Editor New York Times Magazine:

Years and years of antisemitic comments and racist attacks on white people.

Sarah Jeong: Editorial Board(!)

Years and years of viciously hateful attacks on white people, including open calls to be “cruel to old white men.”

Tom Wright-Piersanti: Senior Staff Political Editor

Unbelievable history of antisemitism and spreading hate about people of color.

Gina Cherelus: Fact Checker

Long history of homophobia and racism.

The Editors Behind Antisemitic Cartoon

The Times is still engaging in a cover up to protect the people who published a cartoon that looks exactly like the kind of rabid antisemitism we saw from Germany circa 1936.

No one is playing gotcha here. What we have are four major players at the Times, four people with power and influence, who are guilty of expressing seething racial hostility and bigotry over and over and over again. These disgusting sentiments are not one-offs, are not a poorly-worded joke, or a comment made in the heat of the moment… Again and again and again, these racists proved they are racists, these Jew-haters proved they hate Jews, and did so openly and proudly.

In order to condemn Trump and the Trump White House as racist or bigoted, fake news outlets like the Times have to deliberately take the president out of context, straight-up lie, or assume the very worst of intentions behind something that’s been said.

Not so with the New York Times…

In order to condemn multiple New York Times staffers as racists and antisemites, you need only read and publish their public social media posts.

In order to condemn the New York Times as a haven for hate and bigotry, you need only point to the people the Times hires and appoints to senior positions.

To be clear, I am not asking the Times to fire anyone. I don’t do that. I don’t believe in that. And in this particular case, I’m thrilled the New York Times has chosen to embrace this cabal of racists, because I am always thrilled when a person or organization stops hiding behind lies and reveals who and what they really are.

“Not right now,” Grisham said in a wide-ranging interview with Fox & Friends, when asked if the briefings will return to its previous schedule during her tenure as White House press secretary.

“I mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it’s something we should do, we can do that, but right now he’s doing just fine. And to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater,” she explained. “And I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous. I mean, yeah, they’re writing books now. I mean, they’re all getting famous off of this presidency. And so I think it’s great what we’re doing now.”

While many White House reporters have sought to boost their personal profiles in the Trump era, no example is more apparent than CNN’s chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta, whose frequent outbursts toward the president and members of his administration have earned him scorn and mockery from the White House and even from some of his establishment media colleagues. He even wrote in his book — Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America — that his abrasive demeanor towards President Trump and other administration officials “bothers some people” and he is guilty of “showboating,” even “grandstanding.” Last November, the CNN reporter had his White House press credential temporarily suspended over a heated exchange with President Trump.

Later in her interview with Fox News, Grisham went on to praise President Trump as “his own best spokesperson” and the “most accessible president in history, as all of the media knows.” The president’s frequent gaggles with the White House press corps has been a fixture of his presidency and something his predecessors often avoided.

“I think that it’s so important that, you know, the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there, and I think the president saw that that’s not what was happening,” Grisham continued. “It had become, again, theater, and they weren’t being good to his people. And he doesn’t like that. He’s very loyal to his people and he put a stop to it.”"

Case in point…

If you want to gauge just how desperately stupid a Trump scandal is, there are three tried and true methods: 1) Turn on CNNLOL. 2) Is Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) appearing on State of the Union with former journalist Jake Tapper to scream about having the goods to impeach? 3) Is the disgraced Carl Bernstein appearing on Reliable Sources with Brian “Tater” Stelter to scream about Worse than Watergate?

That’s how dumb this scandal is… The same discredited players saying the exact same things they say every time they want us to believe they got Drumpf fer realzies this time.

Tapper and Schiff.

Stelter and Bernstein.

Dumb and Dumber.

Rinse, wash, repeat…

Welcome to another Russia Collusion Hoax flashback.

These idiots have no imagination, no self-awareness, and they are so exhausted by their own bullshit, so demoralized by loss after loss after loss, they can’t even come up with some fresh ideas or a new way to scream THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN ON THE ORANGE BAD MAN!

Late last week, I wrote about just how stupid this whistleblower scandal is. Now I regret pulling the trigger prematurely, because now that we know more, I underestimated just how stupid this whole thing really is.

The biggest piece of stupid is that even if Trump is guilty of the worst thing he is accused of… So what?

Think about this…

1) After President Obama made Vice President Joe Biden the White House’s point person on Ukraine, Joe Biden’s son, who has absolutely no background — meaning no skill or expertise — in the energy sector, was paid something like a million dollars from a Ukrainian energy company for his, uhm, expertise.

2) When the Ukraine government began to look into this obvious corruption, Biden threatened to withhold critical U.S. aid unless the government agreed to fire the prosecutor investigating his son, and we know this happened because Biden has been stupid enough to brag about it.

3) Trump asks Ukraine to look into all of this.

Here’s today’s big question… Out of those three, which one is a scandal? Bob, I’m going to go with door number one and door number two.

So that’s how the world turns if the scandal is accurate, and we already know it’s not.

Surprise, surprise, y’all — it’s Fake News!

Gee, who saw that coming — I mean, other than everyone.

To begin with, this so-called whistleblower didn’t even hear the phone call he or she is blowing the whistle on. In other words, it’s all hearsay and rumor.

And where does our fake news media hide this rather pertinent fact? In paragraph number 22, naturally.

We also have the Ukrainian foreign minister defending Trump, saying:

I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.

And there you go…

The dumbest part, though, is the political part…

Because the media no longer have any credibility with the public, politicians are no longer judged on these scandals. The public understands the media have an ax to grind and are completely unreliable, so whenever the next big scandal comes along, voters wisely roll their eyes.

What the public does look at, though, is how the politician in question handles the scandal, and if the politician is cool under fire, remains composed, and handles the media storm with savvy and skill, this can actually increase the respect the public have for this person. And so far, Trump is handling the “whistleblower” scandal beautifully, while Joe Biden is having public meltdowns.

Trump has remained calm, cool, confident, and on offense, while Biden, who is already a weak and vulnerable candidate with exploding eyes and loose teeth, looks rattled as he feigns being a tough guy.

“Increasingly, girly boys and tomboys are being told that gender trumps sex, and if a boy is effeminate or bookish or freaked out by team sports, he may actually be a girl, and if a girl is rough and tumble, sporty, and plays with boys, she may actually be a boy,” Sullivan wrote September 20 for New York Magazine.

The cost of that pro-transgender propaganda may be huge, Sullivan wrote:

I don’t have children, but I sure worry about gay kids in this context. I remember being taunted by some other kids when I was young — they suggested that because I was mildly gender-nonconforming, I must be a girl. If my teachers and parents and doctors had adopted this new ideology, I might never have found the happiness of being gay and comfort in being male. How many gay kids, I wonder, are now being led into permanent physical damage or surgery that may be life-saving for many, but catastrophic for others, who come to realize they made a mistake. And what are gay adults doing to protect them? Nothing. Only a few ornery feminists, God bless them, are querying this. In some ways, the extremism of the new transgender ideology also risks becoming homophobic. Instead of seeing effeminate men as one kind of masculinity, as legitimate as any other, transgenderism insists that girliness requires being a biological girl. Similarly, a tomboy is not allowed to expand the bandwidth of what being female can mean, but must be put into the category of male. In my view, this is not progressive; it’s deeply regressive. There’s a reason why Iran is a world leader in sex-reassignment surgery, and why the mullahs pay for it. Homosexuality in Iran is so anathema that gay boys must be turned into girls, and lesbian girls into boys, to conform to heterosexual norms. Sound a little too familiar?

Sullivan backs up his concerns by noting that the teenage sex-change treatment seems to be very hazardous to the physical health of the children:

In the case of merely confused or less informed kids, the consequences of [sex-change] treatment can be permanent. Many of these prepubescent trans-identifying children are put on puberty blockers, drugs that suppress a child’s normal hormonal development, and were originally designed for prostate cancer and premature puberty. The use of these drugs for gender dysphoria is off-label, unapproved by the FDA; there have been no long-term trials to gauge the safety or effectiveness of them for gender dysphoria, and the evidence we have of the side effects of these drugs in FDA-approved treatment is horrifying. Among adults, the FDA has received 24,000 reports of adverse reactions, over half of which it deemed serious. Parents are pressured into giving these drugs to their kids on the grounds that the alternative could be their child’s suicide. Imagine the toll of making a decision about your child like that?

Sullivan’s concern was echoed in an article describing how an Australian teenage girl broke away from her transgender clique by gathering the courage to declare herself a lesbian. The September 21 article in the Australian said:

Seemingly conservative, her parents couldn’t see the liberating appeal of trans. “They said, ‘Why would you say you’re not a woman? Wouldn’t it be better to defy all the expectations that are put on women, accept you’re a woman and be a good role model?’ “I remember going back to the queer group and saying, ‘Can you believe they said something so transphobic to me?’ ” But she began flirting with her own thought crime. She took a risk, in private with a fellow queer group member she judged a friend. “I said, ‘I think it’s OK for women to be only into other women’, which you’d think in a tolerant inclusive community would be an OK thing to say.” … Questions and doubts came in a tumble. “It was very rapid, which was kind of scary because I felt like everything unravelled really quickly, and I think that’s somewhat common. I became really aware that I was going to lose all my friends, lose my whole [transgender] community as soon as I said I was not trans. I moved cities before I told anyone.”

The growing concerns about the radical ideology are forcing some governments to curb the use of drugs and surgery to impose “gender confirmation” on children who are too young to vote:

The Swedish Government announced today that they are putting the brakes on proposed laws reducing the minimum age for gender reassignment surgeries from 18 to 15.@Transgendertrd @cwknews https://t.co/COaxlW6b21 — Marcus Birch (@MarcusBirch5) September 19, 2019

In the United States, President Donald Trump is changing rules and regulations to restore the clear legal and civic distinctions between the two equal, different, and complementary sexes of male and female. This policy has outraged progressive leaders and the transgender groups, and both are asking the Supreme Court to legally abolish the two sexes by declaring that people’s internal feelings of “gender” be declared as always more important than their female-or-male biological sex.

Breitbart News has extensively covered the ideological motives which explain why progressives are so eager to exploit the adults and children who say they want to change their sex, despite much evidence of the medical dangers and loneliness suffered people who try to change their sex:

The progressive authors do not urge the small number of transgender people to seek other options, for example, waiting to see if their feelings change, or perhaps accepting a gay or lesbian identity. Instead, the authors use the plight of transgender Americans to push for a government-engineered transformation of sex and human relations throughout the United States. Progressives believe this sexual revolution is possible because they believe sexual preferences are merely a “social construct,” which can be demolished and rebuilt by government. “Sexual classification is neither natural nor universal, but rather historically and culturally specific …. [and] sexual orientation is more accurately described as fluid … or in a constant state of (re)negotiation,” say the authors, Karen L. Blair, and Rhea Ashley Hoskin. … To change the public’s view that heterosexuality is the normal and best path, the pro-transgender progressives have adopted a strategy of using their allies in universities, media, and marketing to first downplay the linguistic, legal and civic distinctions between the two sexes. For example, progressives are using the vague idea of “gender” to bury the obvious notion of “male or female.” This rhetorical carpet-bombing has also encouraged the claim that men who live as women possess a “female penis.” Also, progressives use outliers — such as gay people, transgender people, or “intersex” people who have some biological attributes of the other sex, or the fact that women produce small levels of the male hormone, testosterone — to deny the overwhelming popularity of two-sex heterosexual normality. … This progressives’ strategy also requires their coalition to hide or downplay facts which spotlight the importance of biological sexual differences. For example, progressives ignore the many young women and men who “detransition” by quitting their damaging efforts to become transgender, and they denounce evidence that young people who would become gays or lesbians are being “transed.”

Progressives use the near-universal sexual rejection of transgender people to justify their demand that government sneak another sexual revolution into Americans' lives & communities. The goal is ending ""compulsory heterosexuality"" & the ""gender binary."" https://t.co/En8OHnfmXA — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 6, 2019

Transgender Facts

In general, the transgender ideology says a person’s legal and civic recognition as a man or a woman must be determined by their “gender identity,” not by their biology.

The ideology also insists that men and women are more or less interchangeable, and it objects to the public’s view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal.

The transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing “transgender rights” laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that biology determines male-or-female status — and also shapes peoples’ likely political, civic, and personal priorities.

Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.

Multiple polls show that most Americans reasonably wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that people’s legal sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of sympathy for people who say they are transgender alongside lopsided opposition to the ideology.

The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have competing goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the differences between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, troubled teenage girls trying to flee womanhood, and people trying to “detransition” back to their sex.

It also includes men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women’s rights, alpha males who insist they are the natural leaders of women, parents eager to support their children’s’ transgender claims, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, revenue-seeking drug companies, surgeons, and medical service providers.

Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study. A Pentagon report commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that “rates for genital surgery are exceedingly low- 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.”

The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many popular social rules. Those rules help Americans manage cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.

These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civil society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy."

Trump’s opponents have cried “quid pro quo” for Trump insisting on information regarding the younger Biden in exchange for foreign aid designated for Ukraine.

“I don’t know that this is the way it went, but my guess is, ‘You guys want your $250 million? OK, send us the Biden file on how all that money went out of there and what was going on in there, what that was all about, and you got yourselves a deal,'” he said. “That is called politics.”

“That is called a quid pro quo,” Clift said.

“What do you think happens every day in this city?” Buchanan said. “[L]yndon Johnson — you want a dam out there in Idaho, you better vote for the war.”

According to Buchanan, this appeared to be the latest chapter in the “Deep State-media alliance” going against Trump.

“Behind this all is what?” Buchanan said. “It is the Deep State-media alliance in this city, which is resisting and attempting to overthrow the government the American people have imposed upon them. Issue after issue it is the same thing and involves these two warring factions in this city.”

He predicted this would backfire on Biden’s candidacy because it would raise questions about Biden’s son.

“Let me tell you who is going to be the loser here: It’s going to be Joe Biden because all this stuff — if it goes to the Hill, people are going to say, ‘What is he talking about, Biden and Ukraine? What happened over there? What did Hunter Biden do? Let’s get all those details out. You get the Freedom Caucus — they’ll be all over this.”

Bernstein said, “Also there is this whole question about the children of presidents of the United States and vice presidents, in this case, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden is a legitimate story to be looked at in terms of his role in this Ukrainian gas company. There is nothing that I’m seeing that substantiates Mr. Giuliani’s or the president’s allegations about crooked prosecutors dropping charges because it was Biden.”

He added, “But if anybody has a history of terrible conflict of interest by his children, it is this president of the United States. And we ought to be looking at all of these questions about the children of presidents and vice presidents of the United States in conflicts of interest.

Jazmine Hughes, an associate editor of the New York Times Magazine, has made a series of racist and antisemitic comments on social media over a multi-year span. A number of the tweets came from Hughes’s personal account, which is associated with her Times email, after she was hired by the outlet in April 2015 and continued well into 2017.

Breitbart News has been able to confirm the authenticity of the tweets, which are still visible on Hughes’s page at the time of the publication of this story. While Twitter has not officially verified Hughes’ account, her official New York Times website biography links to the account, confirming it is in fact hers.

Hughes is a high-profile New York Times editor. Forbes highlighted her on its 2018 “30 Under 30” list of influential media figures. The business magazine even conducted a brief interview with her, where she promoted herself as a champion of “diverse storytelling,” in the words of Forbes.

Hughes is only the latest Times employee to be exposed for making controversial and racially offensive statements. In recent months the paper has been rocked by multiple instances of such behavior at its top editorial ranks.

Although most of the tweets center around every day interactions, a few have pointed to political overtones. Hughes appears to have been particularly irate with white people for electing President Donald Trump. Late on election night 2016, shortly after it became clear that Trump had won the presidency, Hughes took to social media to state she had not been so angry at white people since having learned of Drake and Taylor Swift’s short but ill-fated relationship.

And I thought I was mad at white people when it was rumored that Drake was dating Taylor — Jazmine Hughes (@jazzedloon) November 9, 2016

Another tweet that Hughes sent in the days following the election seemed to imply she blamed white women for Trump’s victory — an argument the Times itself made the morning after the election.

.@allisona15 good morning everyone except for white women, and especially and deliberately except for you — Jazmine Hughes (@jazzedloon) November 11, 2016

Hughes continued making disparaging tweets about white people and Jews well into 2017. Her most recent came in June 2017, when the editor claimed, “Jews are inDEED good with money.”

time and again i find myself reflecting on America's only good white woman, Katie Ledecky — Jazmine Hughes (@jazzedloon) May 19, 2017

honestly it was just a matter of time before jenna slid in to confirm that, yes, jews are inDEED good with money — Jazmine Hughes (@jazzedloon) June 30, 2017

Even prior to joining the Times, Hughes had a history of controversial comments and writings. In February 2015, shortly before being hired by the Times, Hughes stated the “working title” of a piece she had just authored for the New Republic was, “What can take yr freedom, but can’t take a joke? White people.”

My working title for this was ""What can take yr freedom, but can't take a joke? White people"" but that was (rightfully!) edited out :D — Jazmine Hughes (@jazzedloon) February 6, 2015

The article in question discussed what Hughes saw as the “gentrification” of humor at “white people’s expense.” Hughes argued that “racialized humor is an instrument that people of color can use to placate themselves in the face of the overwhelming reality: It’s just better to be Caucasian.”

“By making fun of white people, people of color can, in a small way, push back against stereotypes, opposing racial humor by inverting it,” Hughes wrote, claiming such jokes “gain membership in a club open to all people of color, a space impervious to white hegemony.”

The article’s premise is that as white people become more aware of systematic inequalities, they begin to make light of their privilege in an effort to sympathize with communities of color. In most cases, however, Hughes argued such attempts at solidarity only reinforce the status quo at the expense of people of color.

“This is how the party ends—with white people wanting in on the joke so badly that they create a separate category of ‘cool’ white people who mock their own whiteness in an effort at solidarity,” she wrote.

The article appears to be the only one Hughes authored for the New Republic. Since joining the Times, she has occasionally written pieces centered on the intersection of race and culture. Her most recent project for the Times’ magazine was the 1619 Project, a comprehensive series of articles and essays arguing that slavery was the institution that fundamentally shaped the modern United States.

The newspaper made a massive investment in the 1619 Project, through which it aimed to redefine America’s understanding of the history of slavery. Hughes was no small part of the newspaper’s work on this, as she was on the byline of one of two major feature pieces on the broadsheet print edition of the special.

“The broadsheet special section has two components: A reported essay by Nikita Stewart, a reporter on The Times’s Metro desk, examining why Americans are so poorly educated on slavery, followed by a history of slavery written by Mary Elliott, curator of American slavery at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, and Jazmine Hughes, a writer and editor at The Times Magazine,” the Times wrote about how its 1619 Project feature came together, highlighting the critical role that Hughes played in its publication.

It is unclear if the Times knew of Hughes’s prior controversial tweets before allowing her to undertake a project of such means. Representatives for the paper did not return requests for comment.

The revelation of Hughes’ tweets come shortly after the Times declared it intended to hone in on racial issues leading up to the 2020 presidential race. Those efforts, though, have been severely undercut by multiple revelations concerning the paper’s staff using racist, anti-Semitic, and generally disparaging comments.

Breitbart News reported in August that one of the outlet’s senior news desk editors, Tom Wright-Piersanti, had a history of making anti-Semitic and racist statements on his social media accounts spanning over years. Wright-Piersanti, who helps oversee the paper’s political coverage, apologized for the prior comments, but as of now is still employed by the Times even though the outlet is reportedly “reviewing next steps.”

Two other individuals associated with the outlet, a fact checker Gina Cherelus and a recent addition to its editorial board — Sarah Jeong — have also been exposed for making racist comments. Jeong, in particular, has denigrated white people in the past, comparing them to dogs.

The Times also published a series of antisemitic cartoons in its international print edition earlier this year, which the newspaper later retracted and then admitted were antisemitic. In response, the Times has still not identified the personnel responsible for the publication of the antisemitic cartoons or whether those people have been held accountable–but instead has decided to not publish any more cartoons because it cannot trust its staff to not publish more antisemitism.

All of these incidents and more have amounted to what Breitbart News’ John Nolte has described as a humiliating year for the New York Times, after a summer of public meltdowns and serious institutional mistakes."

All the Time,"Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” host Brian Stelter declared that President Donald Trump’s word could not be “seriously,” because he comes up with “B.S. all the time.”

Stelter said, “The president has exhausted his benefit of the doubt a long time ago because of the constant lies and deflections. I want to show you three examples this week that stood out to me. Trump said something crazy, and the White House doesn’t try to back it up. He said the government used mountain climbers to test the border wall. The White House wouldn’t explain. Then Trump on Twitter said that Obama’s Netflix still should be investigating. Maybe there is something crooked there. They didn’t want to respond about what laws may be broken. So take a look. I asked White House press secretary what laws is he seeing were broken? What statutes have been violated? Obviously, she has not responded to my request for comment. She doesn’t know what to say. There is no illegal partnership. I guess my point is the White House claims these tweets speak for themselves, but the tweets make no sense. What does it reveal about the situation we’re in, especially with regard to this Ukraine scandal that the president’s words can’t be taken seriously?”

Veteran reporter Carl Bernstein said, “There is a major Republican, Senator Burr, who has been a great defender and introduced whistleblower legislation, defended whistleblowers, and it is time for Burr, a senior Republican on the Intel Committee and chairman of the Intel Committee in the Senate to say we need to see all of this correspondence. We need to release under the Whistleblower Act what occurred here. We need the transcript. And the president of the United States says, ‘Oh, this was a beautiful conversation. It was fine, and it was all above board,’ let the president release the transcript if that’s the case.”

Stelter shot back, “We can’t take his word seriously. He comes up with this B.S. all the time. He says things like that. We can’t take those words seriously.”

Bernstein said, “Well, I think the first thing is to find out exactly what has happened here. And if the reporting of Shane Harris and The Wall Street Journal is accurate and it seems to be it clearly moves toward a grievance abuse of power by the president of the United States.”

He added, “I keep getting asked are there echoes of Watergate in this? And there are in the following ways, Watergate was an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the democratic electoral process in the United States our basis of democracy by trying through political espionage and sabotage to nominate through political dirty tricks and misinformation its weakest candidate, George McGovern instead of its strongest candidate, Senator Edmund Muskie who Nixon didn’t want to run against.”

“And something in the same thing seems to be happening here, where Biden who Trump and his people said they fear the most in terms of being an opponent has been an object of these perhaps dirty tricks and abuses of power,” Bernstein continued. “One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a big offense if this is what happened, and it seems to be.”

Mr Humphrys expressed his relief at being free from “the BBC Thought Police” which he claims has “tried to mould the nation into its own liberal-Left image”, despite the broadcaster’s notional legals requirement to remain balanced and impartial, in memoirs which are being serialised by the Daily Mail.

The 76-year-old Welshman revealed the BBC’s “[great] fear of the politically correct brigade and the most fashionable pressure groups — usually from the liberal Left, the spiritual home of most bosses and staff”, and how the “disaster” of the British people’s vote to Leave the European Union in 2016 — against the advice of the left-neoliberal establishment — sent them reeling:

“The morning of the EU Referendum was different. Leave had won — and this was not what the BBC had expected. Nor what it wanted. No nods and smiles when the big bosses appeared. No attempt to pretend that this was anything other than a disaster. Their expressions were as grim as the look on the face of a football supporter when his team’s star player misses the penalty that would have won them the cup.”

Humphrys, though he voted to Remain in the European Union himself, said the result “exposed a fundamental flaw in the culture of the BBC”, and that “Its bosses, almost to a man and woman, could simply not grasp how anyone could have put a cross in the Leave box on the referendum ballot paper.”

He suggested that the public broadcasters was similarly out of touch on issues such as mass migration, and how the efforts of Robin Aitken, a senior BBC journalist, to put together a dossier highlighting the way the corporation had fallen into a “Left-wing agenda [which] was ‘wholeheartedly and unashamedly pro-EU’” were met first with silence and then with an instruction to “f**k off”.

“There is, I believe, a groupthink mentality, an implicit BBC attitude to what makes news,” Humphrys opined, suggesting its “institutional liberal bias” was not so much a product of conspiracy as of its tendency to recruit middle-class liberal arts graduates–” a disproportionately large proportion of whom had been to private schools” — trained by left-wing academics.

“This may explain why the BBC sometimes fails so badly to spot a change in the nation’s mood — in hugely important areas,” he added.

“Immigration was one of them.”

Humphrys is not the first BBC veteran to highlight the corporation’s bias — although for his part Humphrys believes it is still a “force for good” overall — with Peter Sissons, who presented the BBC Nine O’Clock News and the BBC Ten O’Clock News for a decade, having alleged that a left-wing “mindset” was “At the core of the BBC, in its very DNA” in 2011.

“By far the most popular and widely read newspapers at the BBC are The Guardian and The Independent,” he revealed, referring to two major left-wing, europhile outlets.

“Producers refer to them routinely for the line to take on ­running stories, and for inspiration on which items to cover,” he said.

“In the later stages of my career, I lost count of the number of times I asked a producer for a brief on a story, only to be handed a copy of The Guardian and told ‘it’s all in there’.”

The IOC had hoped that their scientific advisors could agree to halve the permitted levels of testosterone in transgender athletes, but the experts could not agree, according to the Guardian.

The current guidelines issued in 2015 maintain that men claiming to be transgender women can compete in the female categories even if they have not completed the transformational surgery only if their testosterone level measures below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before competing.

While some of the IOC’s experts insisted that the current requirements could be lowered further without creating an unfair playing field, others are pointing to recent research which claims that testosterone levels really have little effect on a transgender woman’s biologically male muscle strength.

The Guardian reports that the IOC’s experts went around and around over the issue but could not agree that the new guidelines are warranted.

Another source told the paper that the IOC still has hopes of getting a consensus, but agreement “proved far more difficult than expected because this is such a tricky political and emotive issue.”

In nearly every area of sports where former men compete as women, they have become instant champions over the biological female athletes. From U.S. high school sports, to international cycling competition, to Australian handball, to New Zealand weight lifting, nearly every time a biological male enters women’s categories, biological females lose.

Witnesses say the suspects raced away from the scene in a Chrysler 300.

“In his senior season at Texas Tech, Emmett averaged 20.6 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He was a consensus First Team All-American and was named to the All-Big 12 Team during the 2003-2004 season. Emmett helped Texas Tech get to the second round of the NCAA Tournament that season,” Fox News reports.

After a stellar career at Texas Tech, Emmett became the 35th pick of the Seattle Supersonics in the 2004 NBA Draft. Emmett played most of his pro career overseas, but had two other NBA stops in Memphis and New Jersey. After his NBA career, he went on to stardom in the BIG3, becoming the league’s second leading scorer.

Emmett was inducted into the Texas Tech Ring of Honor earlier this year.

A handful of fans in Portland were prohibited from attending matches this season after challenging a ban on the Iron Front, a symbol with three arrows pointed downward and to the left that was first used by an anti-Nazi paramilitary group in the 1930s. The league had said the emblem violated a ban on political displays included in the MLS fan code of conduct adopted this season.

MLS maintained the symbol is political because it has been appropriated by antifa, loosely organized militant groups of anti-fascists that sometimes engage in violence. Supporters’ groups maintain the Iron Front represents opposition to fascism and persecution — a human rights issue, not a political stance.

Portland Timbers and Seattle Sounders supporters’ groups, as well as the Independent Supporters’ Council, protested the ban, and some fans across the league continued to use the symbol on flags, banners and signs at games.

Both sides met last Thursday in Las Vegas to find a resolution. An additional conference call was held Tuesday afternoon.

MLS President and Deputy Commissioner Mark Abbott said in a statement the league would also form a working group, including representatives from the league, its clubs, the ISC and the supporters’ groups, to re-examine the code of conduct going forward.

“This working group will include representatives from the league office and clubs and work collaboratively with leaders of club supporter groups and a cross-section of diversity and inclusion experts,” Abbott said.

The supporters groups also issued a statement.

“The Independent Supporters Council and supporter groups for the Portland Timbers and Seattle Sounders FC acknowledge the league’s willingness to discuss these complex issues, as well as the league’s affirmation of its long-time opposition to racism, fascism, white supremacy, white nationalism and homophobia,” the statement said. “We appreciate Major League Soccer’s willingness to engage, listen, and learn. We look forward to continuing the dialogue, moving away from direct action in the stands on this issue, and instead focusing our energy on making progress around the table.”

The league’s fan code of conduct, implemented this season, prohibits “using (including on any sign or other visible representation) political, threatening, abusive, insulting, offensive language and/or gestures, which includes racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist or otherwise inappropriate language or behavior.”

Earlier this season, a fan waving a Trump 2020 flag was removed from Providence Park."

Rypien was arrested after an altercation with his wife in Spokane, Washington, on June 30. The ex-Redskins quarterback told police that his wife began acting out while he was driving, hitting him in the head with a cell phone, pouring water on him, yelling at him, and even covering his eyes as he was driving. He told police he struck her to stop her from attacking him as he drove, TMZ reported.

Still, the 56-year-old player was arrested and charged with assaulting the woman.

A previous video obtained by TMZ shows the aftermath of the couple’s alleged altercation. The video shows Rypien’s wife on her hands and knees and seems to be in distress.

But now, police have released a second video showing Rypien’s arrest that also shows his wife sitting on the ground in possible distress.

In the video, Rypien is seen explaining what he claims his wife did while he was driving. “She was covering my face up, and I was scared we were going to get into a wreck,” he says on the video.

A police report noted that officers found that the interior of the car was wet lending veracity to Rypien’s claim that his wife poured water on him.

But his wife is also heard in the video expressing worries about what will happen if the police arrest her husband.

“He raises money for cancer, and it will hurt his reputation,” she tells police.

Officers ultimately arrested Rypien since he admitted that he hit his wife. Eventually, the ex-NFL player had the charges dropped after promising to get counseling.

Rypien released a statement to explain the incident:

In light of the dismissal of the misdemeanor assault charge against me, I want to express my appreciation to the citizen callers who reported this incident and to the officers involved for their efforts to protect Danielle on the day of this incident. I also appreciate the professionalism of the officers, jail staff, court personnel, and the prosecutor’s office in having treated me with respect and civility through a very difficult process. I want to be clear that I did not assault Danielle. We were having an argument, and she put her hands on my face, blocking my view of the road while I was driving. I shoved her aside out of actual fear that I might drive our car into a pedestrian, or otherwise cause a collision that could harm others or one of us. This was done to protect innocent bystanders and both her and I — I had no intent to harm or offend [Danielle] in any way.

The Big 10 coach who once blamed “young people” with cell phones for declining college football attendance, took aim at users of one of the world’s most popular social media cites during a press conference on Monday.

Fitzgerald’s Wildcats, who scored only ten points against Michigan State on Saturday, made it clear that he had no use for the “40,000 experts” on Twitter and their play calling suggestions.

Watch:

It’s debatable whether establishing yourself as anti-cell phone or anti-Twitter, is a good thing when your job requires you to appeal to 18-year-old kids. Then again, Fitzgerald is one of the longest tenured coaches in all of college football so maybe that’s exactly what it takes.

In any event, the offensive struggles of the 1-2 Wildcats are well-established: The Cats have only scored 47 points in three weeks of football. Fitzgerald doesn’t have to listen to anyone on Twitter about how to correct that, but he may want to at least talk to someone on Facebook or Instagram.

The embattled receiver who spent only 11 days on New England’s roster before being cut last week, was due a $5 million installment of that money on Monday. The Patriots, however, did not pay it.

The dispute comes down to whether Brown committed a “forfeitable breach” of contract under the labor deal. For example, as Pro Football Talk explains, the Patriots would have to make the case that Brown commited a forfeitable breach by not making the Patriots aware of the imminent rape and sexual misconduct accusations that were headed his way. The Patriots contend that they would not have signed Brown if they knew those allegations were coming.

Of course, one would have to prove that Brown knew of those charges before he signed with the Patriots. Regardless, though, that type of case is what the Patriots would have to prove in order to prove Brown committed a forfeitable breach which would justify withholding the signing bonus.

“Brown undoubtedly will file a grievance aimed at getting the $9 million, along with the balance of his $1 million guaranteed salary,” Pro Football Talk reports.

Brown’s minimum pay from the Patriots will be $283,333.

But the honor comes on the heels of recent sanctions against several athletes who also protested only just this year.

The USOPC Hall of Fame’s latest induction class will include Smith and Carlos during a November 1 ceremony in Colorado Springs, Colorado, according to the Washington Post.

The pair of sprinters made world news when they protested against the U.S. by raising a militant black power fist in the air on the medal stand after receiving their medals. The protest was a planned affair, not a spur of the moment decision, because the two shed their shoes and wore black gloves to highlight “oppression, poverty, and pride.”

The actions immediately sparked controversy with most voices in and out of the Olympics condemning the protests. Eventually, the USPOC apologized to Mexico, the 1968 host nation, and condemned the Olympians for their actions. However, fearing a widespread backlash among athletes, neither was suspended. Both runners, though, were also expelled from the games and sent home with the threat that if they did not leave, the whole U.S. delegation would be eliminated from the games.

However, 51 years later, all is forgiven, and the two runners are being honored as inductees into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame.

The honor, though, comes on the heels of sanctions leveled against two other Olympians for protesting against the U.S. during this year’s games.

In August, Olympic fencer Race Imboden and hammer-thrower Gwen Berry were both sanctioned with a one-year probation for protesting on the medal stand during the Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, NBC News reported.

Imboden took a knee during the national anthem at the men’s foil team medal ceremony, while Berry raised a fist during the national anthem at the women’s hammer throw award ceremony.

On top of the probations, the USOPC also warned that penalties could be worse for other athletes protesting in future games, including next summer’s Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

Still, the contrast is jarring between celebrating Olympics protesters from 1968 even as Olympics officials sanction today’s protesters.

The season was supposed to end Oct. 17-20 at Clearwater Bay Golf & Country Club in Hong Kong. Instead, the 13th and final tournament will be held Oct. 10-13 at the Macau Championship.

Hong Kong is in the fourth month of protests that occur every weekend, and some have been violent. The protests started out as opposition to a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy. Last weekend, protesters threw gasoline bombs and police responded with tear gas.

Greg Carlson, the executive director of PGA Tour Series-China, said safety was at the forefront of the decision.

“We have analyzed this situation from every angle, and as a group we determined that canceling the 2019 Clearwater Bay Open is the best decision,” he said.

Carlson said the tour looked into an alternate site for the tournament without finding one it deemed suitable. He described Macau as a vibrant part of Asia and the tour had a good experience at Ceasars Golf Macau last year.

Because of the late change, the prize money in Macau will increase by 500 million Renminbi to 2.1 million.

PGA Tour Series-China has played two official events at Clearwater Bay in 2016 and 2018, along with an unofficial event in 2017. Carlson said the tour expects to return.

(AP) — The University of Kansas received a notice of allegations from the NCAA on Monday that alleges significant violations within its storied men’s basketball program, including a responsibility charge leveled against Hall of Fame coach Bill Self.

The notice includes three Level 1 violations tied primarily to recruiting and cites a lack of institutional control. It also includes notice of a secondary violation in football tied to then-coach David Beaty that involved the use of an extra coach during practice.

While the document does not go into detail about what the basketball program is accused of doing, Kansas was among the most prominent programs swept up in an NCAA probe into a pay-for-play scheme that began with an FBI investigation into apparel company Adidas. A former Adidas employee testified that he made payments to the family of one Kansas recruit and the guardian of a current player. Text messages presented in court revealed a close relationship between Self and the Adidas employee.

The school said in a statement that it “strongly disagrees with the assertion that it ‘lacks institutional control.’ In fact, the university believes the record will demonstrate just the opposite.”

“The University of Kansas has high standards of ethical conduct for all our employees, and we take seriously any conduct that is antithetical to our values and missions,” Kansas chancellor Doug Girod said. “While we will accept responsibility for proven violations of NCAA bylaws, we will not shy from forcefully pushing back on allegations that the facts simply do not substantiate.”

Girod also said that the school would “stand firmly behind coach Self,” who delivered its fifth national championship in 2008 and has a team that could contend for another title this season.

The NCAA’s Stacey Osburn declined to comment on “current, pending or ongoing investigations.”

“I have always taken pride in my commitment to rules compliance and led programs that operate with integrity,” Self said, “and I am proud of the success that we have achieved at each program along the way. Every student-athlete who has ever played for me and their families know we follow the rules.

“These allegations are serious and damaging to the university and to myself,” he added, “and I hate that KU has to go through this process. With our staff’s full cooperation, these allegations will be addressed within NCAA procedures with urgency and resolve.”

Kansas had been in the NCAA’s crosshairs since early this summer, when Vice President Stan Wilcox said at least six schools were likely to receive notices of allegations for Level 1 infractions.

North Carolina State was the first of them, getting a notice July 10 of two violations, including a failure-to-monitor charge leveled against former coach Mark Gottfried.

Arizona, Auburn, Creighton, Louisville, LSU and USC have also been under the microscope.

Level 1 infractions are considered the most severe by the NCAA, and often include postseason bans, the forfeiture of wins and championships and the loss of scholarships. But the notice itself is only the beginning of a process that can often take more than a year — the school typically sends a response to the NCAA enforcement committee, setting off an exchange of information.

Ultimately, a hearing will be scheduled and Kansas will be allowed to present its case. The NCAA will then issue its ruling, often within several months, and the school retains the right to appeal.

The former Adidas employee, T.J. Gassnola, testified in October that he made a a $90,000 payment to the family of then-Kansas recruit Billy Preston and $2,500 to the guardian of current forward Silvio De Sousa.

Gassnola, who avoided prison time by cooperating with the investigation, said he also paid $20,000 to Fenny Falmagne, De Sousa’s guardian, to pry the prospect loose from an agreement with Maryland.

Self said last October that “when recruiting potential student-athletes, my staff and I have not and do not offer improper inducements to them, or their families, to influence their college decisions, nor are we aware of any third-party involvement to do so.”

Gassnola testified that Self was unaware of the payments, but text messages and phone records indicate a close relationship with the national championship-winning coach. And an attorney for former Adidas executive James Gatto told a jury that his client approved the payment to Falmagne only after Self and his longtime assistant, Kurtis Townsend, requested Gassnola to provide it.

“The evidence, I submit, shows that Kansas’ head coach knew of and asked for a payment to be made to Silvio De Sousa’s handler,” the attorney, Michael Schachter, said at the time. “More than that, coach Self requested just the kind of help that Mr. Gassnola arranged as a condition for coach Self to permit Adidas to continue their sponsorship agreement with the University of Kansas.”

In April, the school signed a 14-year, $196 million extension of its apparel and sponsorship deal with Adidas. The deal, which is worth $14 million annually, runs through the 2030-31 school year.

Gatto, former Adidas consultant Merl Code and handler Chris Dawkins have been found guilty of felony charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the case. Gassnola was given probation as part of his cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

While Gassnola appeared to try to shield Self from the FBI probe, their relationship came out in text messages presented by defense attorneys at his trial. In one exchange, Gassnola texted Self that “I talked to Fenny,” and the coach replied, “We good?” Gassnola said, “Always. That’s light work.”

Later, Gassnola texted about keeping Self and Kansas happy with lottery picks. Self responded: “That’s how (it) works. At UNC and Duke.”

De Sousa was declared ineligible for two full seasons by the NCAA, and sat out last season before declaring for the draft. He withdrew from the draft when the NCAA approved his appeal to play this season.

The Jayhawks had their run of 14 consecutive Big 12 championships end this past season, when Kansas State and Texas Tech tied for the crown. But with several returning stars and another elite recruiting class, the Jayhawks were expected to be a top-five team in the AP preseason poll.

“We strongly disagree with the allegations regarding men’s basketball,” Kansas athletic director Jeff Long said. “We fully support coach Self and his staff, and we will vigorously defend the allegations against him and our university.

“As for the football violations,” Long said, “we fully met the requirements and our responsibility to the NCAA by self-reporting the violations when our compliance procedures uncovered the issues. I am confident in our process to respond to the allegations and look forward to resolving this matter.”"

She made her call on Monday night when she was crowned the top women’s player at the Best FIFA Football awards in Milan, Italy.

The 34-year-old mentioned various issues within the game, including racism, homophobia and equal pay, as she collected her award, before applauding the position she and other players had to be outspoken and be heard.

Rapinoe then addressed what she claimed were critical opportunities for her fellow players if they took the megaphone of sporting success and turned it back on the world at large.

We have such an incredible opportunity, being professional football players. We have incredible platforms. I ask everyone here – lend your platform to other people, lift other people up, share your success. We have a unique opportunity in football to use this beautiful game to actually change the world for better. I hope you take that to heart, and just do something, do anything. We have incredible power in this room.

Rapinoe is no stranger to mixing sport with politics and social action.

As Breitbart News reported, in June she refused to sing the national anthem during a World Cup game in France, only six days after the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

Rapinioe stood silent with her arms behind her back as the rest of the U.S. team placed their hands over their hearts and sang the Star-Spangled Banner ahead of the contest in Reims, France.

Rapinoe had already warned that she would “never sing the anthem again.”

“I’ll probably never put my hand over my heart. I’ll probably never sing the national anthem again,” Rapinoe said in May adding she views herself as “a walking protest when it comes to the Trump administration,” because of “everything I stand for.”"

Jones believes USA Rugby represent a major hurdle at the event, predicting they will bring the same dynamism and self belief projected by U.S. President Donald Trump to the game in Kobe, Japan.

“I’ve watched every game, but the only game I’m worried about at the moment is the USA,” said Jones, according to Japan Today. “The only game I am interested in is the USA. I know they’ve been down in Okinawa and they’ve had a two-week prep, so they’re going to come out all guns blazing.

“It’s going to be like 15 Donald Trumps out there, so we’ll have to be on our job, because we know they’re going to give it everything they’ve got, just like Tonga did. That’s great for us because we’ll have to be at our best.”

For his part, USA coach Gary Gold admitted he was mystified by the comment.

“I’ve absolutely no idea what he means by that,” Gold said, according to AFP.

“We’re just a team that’s really got to focus on our own processes at the moment. We’ve got to worry about what we do when we get onto the rugby field.

“At this stage, with all due respect, we’re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that. I don’t know what it means.”

Jones is known for his sometimes quixotic comments on both sport and geo politics.

He is known to love and back winners, once saying: “Arrogance is only bad when you lose. If you are winning and you are arrogant it is self-belief.”

The Australian-born coach also observed Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido is, “closer to Russia than you probably want to be.”"

Johnson, who retired from the NFL in 2015 after nine seasons, and appeared in six Pro Bowls, told SI’s Michael Rosenberg that he saw a lot of things in his few short years in the big league. But the constant threat of injury is one thing he won’t miss in retirement.

The 33-year-old retiree told the magazine that he suffered no less than nine concussions during his career. And one way he dealt with the physical toll was to smoke pot “after every game.”

Johnson talked about how he suffered “many” concussions, and even got used to it. But he also says that his past claims about his injuries may have been a bit over the top.

“I misused the terms nerve damage and concussion,” he admitted, but then added, “I knew I was concussed because I blacked out. I wasn’t seeing straight. And they wanted me to change my story.”

Still, he insisted that he usually just played through the concussions because that’s just what is done in the league.

But one way he worked through the pain was to self-medicate. Still, Johnson says that pot is nothing compared to the opioids that many other players used.

“When I got to the league, [there] was opioid abuse,” Johnson told the magazine. “You really could go in the training room and get what you wanted. I can get Vicodin, I can get Oxy[contin]. It was too available. I used Percocet and stuff like that. And I did not like the way that made me feel. I had my preferred choice of medicine. Cannabis.”

Buttigieg also called college football’s current amateur model “problematic.”

The Indiana Democrat was asked about the risk of injury college players face, and in return, Buttigieg said, “First, you need to look at what we owe students. Obviously, the model says you get an education in exchange for contributing this way, plus the sport is supposed to be its own reward, but I don’t think that that’s really fair anymore.”

The idea has been spreading across the country. The California legislature recently passed a bill that would allow for student athletes to make money off their names and images.

Buttigieg noted that he is a Notre Dame fan, especially since he is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, the home of the university. “I think about it from a perspective of a city that relies on college football in the same way that Bahrain relies on fossil fuel,” the Democrat said.

However, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the organization that regulates college athletics, spoke out against the bill saying that it is not a legal measure, and even warned that California could be barred from college championships.

The state of New York may also be preparing to introduce a similar bill.

Buttigieg also said that if he had a son, he would “hesitate to let them play football.”

NFL Loaded with 3-0 and 0-3 Teams After Three Weeks,"The NFL is built for competitive balance and parity, to avoid having a league full of have and have-not teams.

That is why all NFL TV and merchandise revenue is split equally among the 32 teams. That is why their draft and waiver-wire allow teams with the worst records to have first dibs at top college players, and the individuals cut by other clubs.

“While some have described our product with words like ‘parity” and ‘mediocrity,’ I prefer to use the term ‘balance,’ former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle wrote in a 1982 New York Times article.

So the late Rozelle perhaps wouldn’t be thrilled with the beginning of this NFL season, with six teams starting 3-0, and five teams 0-3, with a sixth team, Arizona, also winless, but with a tie.

The six 3-0 teams are the Buffalo Bills, New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers.

The five 0-3 teams are the New York Jets, Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos. If these five teams, along with the Cardinals, continue heading south, it could hurt their fan interest, vis-à-vis attendance.

“Competitive balance is what builds fan interest,” Rozelle wrote. “The entire makeup of the NFL is geared toward keeping teams competitive on the field.”

The odds are long for 0-3 teams to make the playoffs.

“It looks like it’s over for the NFL’s 0-3 teams as history hasn’t been kind to slow starters,” wrote Joe Osborne for oddsshark.com “Going way back to 1980, there have been 176 teams to start a season 0-3, with only six of them going on to make the playoffs — a whopping 3.4 percent! If you’re a fan of one of the 0-3 teams and that 3.4 percent number is giving you hope, it shouldn’t.”

Ideally, the NFL, with its parity-driven business model, would at least want teams hanging around in playoff contention into late November, early December, to keep their fans interested.

So what created this divide between undefeated and winless teams this NFL season?

Usually, the factor you can point to first is the quarterback position. The good teams usually have an answer at this all-important position, and the bad teams don’t.

For instance, the Steelers were considered playoff contenders entering the season, but lost franchise quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, to a season-ending elbow injury in their second game. The Dolphins are reportedly tanking this season to land the first pick in the 2019 draft to likely pick Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa, so Miami might be winless by design.

“It’s unethical and morally reprehensible as far as I’m concerned,” ESPN’s Domonique Foxworth said about the Dolphins’ 2019 plan.

The undefeated Patriots, Chiefs, Cowboys, Rams and 49ers are all getting terrific QB play this season. The Bills have a young QB, Josh Allen, who is much improved from his rookie year, but Buffalo has clearly also has benefited from a weak schedule and strong defense. Buffalo will get their first legitimate test in Week Four when New England come to town.

Clearly the NFL office hopes the divide between the teams with perfect records, and also-rans, starts to reverse itself in the coming weeks.

“The goal of the N.F.L.’s founding fathers was to establish rules that permitted each of the franchises to have the opportunity to field a team that would be competitive with the other teams in the league,” Rozelle wrote."

On Monday, Brown posted an image of his class list to Instagram with the message “Back to school @cmuathletics.”

The photo shows four online classes offered by Central Michigan, including: Introduction to Management, Technical Writing, a religious course called Death and Dying, and Racism and Equality.

Despite the timing of the social media posting, ESPN confirmed that Brown actually signed up for the classes before he was released by the Patriots.

Brown attended Central Michigan from 2007 to 2009 and played for the school’s football team before being drafted by the NFL in 2010.

The now former Patriots player hinted on Sunday that he was through with the NFL with a series of tweets that also lambasted the NFL and various players and owners for their sexual harassment charges.

Brown still faces accusations that he sexually harassed one woman and raped a second.

Jose “Speedy” Espericueta always talked about how he wanted to see his teenage son play football for the first time.

“The one thing he couldn’t stop talking about was Joaquin starting football this year,” Officer Javier Lara told CNN on Sunday.

But Espericueta was shot and killed in June while in the line of duty and never got the chance. He was the first officer to die in the line of duty in more than 30 years.

From that moment on, Mission Police Department — as well as several other law enforcement agencies — made it their promise to be there for Joaquin where his father could not.

“We made a promise to the family that we’re gonna be there for special events,” Lara said. “Being the first football game, we gathered agencies from across the valley to let him know that we’re still there, even though his dad’s not.”

Espericueta was shot dead in June while responding to a call from a woman who claimed her son was shooting at her car.

Espericueta attempted to make contact with the young man, who allegedly turned around and shot him. He later died at a hospital from his injuries.

Before the game, Joaquin and several officers took to midfield for a ceremonial coin toss while a helicopter flew above to honor Joaquin.

“He was really excited. He was real thankful about us being here for him,” Lara said. “He has a huge heart. He’s going to be a good young man.”"

“I see a guy hanging out the window screaming that his kids were in there,” Law told the reporters.

But as he described catching the falling children, Law took the opportunity to give the Philly Eagles’ receiver a little jab in the ribs.

In a Sports Illustrated article published over a week ago, the artist, who remains unnamed, claims that Brown made inappropriate sexual advances toward her while she was painting a mural of him in his home. She declined his advances, but there was apparently a lot more to the story.

After Brown sent a series of text messages to the artist, accusing her of fabricating the story as well as including pictures of her children and urging an investigation against her, the woman’s attorney sent a letter to the NFL claiming that Brown had violated the league’s personal conduct policy.

In that letter, Attorney Lisa J. Banks included this claim about what else happened in Brown’s home that day.

“What is not detailed in the story is that Mr. Brown engaged in other forms of sexual misconduct during the two days that she worked in his home, which included Mr. Brown having sex with another woman while the artist was working in the same room.”

The NFL launched an investigation into the artists claims shortly afterwards. Though Brown denies the allegations, the text messages prompted the Patriots to release the embattled wide receiver after only 11 days.

On Sunday morning, Brown announced that he was never playing in the NFL again. In addition, he took several parting shots at Patriots Owner Robert Kraft who was charged with solicitation of prostitution, as well as FS1 commentator Shannon Sharpe, and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who were both accused of sexual assault.

Despite Brown’s claim that he will never play in the league again, the NFL plans to continue their investigation into the allegations against him.

Three days after the future Hall of Fame quarterback complained on Twitter about the number of penalties in the Thursday Night Football game between the Titans and Jaguars, the league saw a precipitous drop in holding penalties.

According to ESPN, “Officials threw 41 flags for offensive holding in 14 games Sunday, an average of 2.9 per game, according to ESPN Stats & Information. In the first 33 games of the season, there were 188 such flags — a rate of 5.7 per game.”

NFL Senior Vice President of Officiating, Al Riveron, held a conference call with league referees this week to address the issue, ESPN reports.

During the Titans-Jaguars game, a game where referees called ten penalties for offensive holding alone, Brady tweeted his disgust at how the number of penalties were interfering with the players ability to play the game.

Too many penalties. Just let us play!!!! #TENvsJAC — Tom Brady (@TomBrady) September 20, 2019

To be fair, Brady wasn’t alone in complaining about rash of penalty flags being thrown. Thousands of fans and media alike, tweeted their frustration at how unwatchable the game had become.

According to ESPN:

This summer, the NFL asked officials to focus on a technique sometimes referred to as a “lobster block,” when an offensive lineman wraps his arms around a defender while blocking on the backside of running plays. As it turned out, they increased their focus on holding all over the field. During the first two weeks of the season, they threw 178 flags for offensive holding — a 66% increase from the same time period in 2018. The spike also contributed to a 16.2% increase in total penalties compared to Weeks 1-2 of last season, as well as a slight drop in scoring from 21.97 offensive points per game in 2018 to 20.9 in 2019. During Saturday’s call, Riveron instructed referees to continue emphasizing the need for offensive linemen to immediately move their blocks inside the frame of the defender if they initiate the block outside. But on front-side and other blocks, Riveron counseled them to allow for more time to get inside the frame.

The league is already facing a potential ratings crisis with injuries to several high-profile quarterbacks such as Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees, and Cam Newton. So, the last thing the league needs right now is constant interruptions for penalties and less scoring. Making an emphasis on holding penalties, of any type, is especially problematic considering that holding is the one penalty that could literally be called on every play.

While the rules have to be followed and the officials clearly have a job to do, a balance has to be struck. That balance is a lot closer to the way holding penalties were called this past Sunday, as opposed to the first two Sundays of the season.

Thanks, Tom Brady.

The Los Angeles Chargers may be second in the AFC West in this early part of the season, but some fans feel their attendance is in last place. As the Chargers welcomed the Houston Texans to the recently re-named Dignity Health Sports Park (formerly StubHub Center), many fans noticed the empty seats:

However, there’s yet another team that has parted ways with the embattled receiver: O.J. Simpson’s fantasy football team.

Simpson made the decision to cut Brown shortly after the former Steeler, Raider, and Patriot, announced that he was done with football.

“My phone started ringing early this morning, fellow fantasy players called me and said, ‘Have you been watching what Antonio Brown is saying this morning?’” Simpson said in a Sunday morning Twitter video.

Watch:

Sometimes you just have to push the drop button. pic.twitter.com/TAd5V5Vgo0 — O.J. Simpson (@TheRealOJ32) September 22, 2019

After noting that Brown had “hit the trifecta,” by lashing out at Patriots Owner Robert Kraft, Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger, and FS1 analysts Shannon Sharpe, Kraft having been charged with solicitation of a prostitute and Roethlisberger and Sharpe with sexual assault, Simpson summed up his feelings thusly.

“I’m not gonna say he’s wrong what he’s saying, but doesn’t look like he’s gonna be back this year,” Simpson explained, concluding that he had “finally had to push the drop button on my fantasy team.”

“Sorry. Really wanted to keep him all year,” the former NFL running back lamented.

Brown was accused of rape by one woman and sexual misconduct by another, both charges played a role in ending his tenure with the Patriots after only 11 days. The NFL is still investigating the claims of Brown’s accusers.

Particularly disturbing, is at the end of the video when you can see Sanders’ face nearly looking out of where the back of his head should be. Yet, somehow, the first near public decapitation since the Dark Ages did not draw a flag form the over-officious officials who currently officiate the NFL.

While Lions defender Miles Killebrew did not draw a flag on the play, it’s a safe bet he’ll be fined by the league.

On Sunday, we learn that the XFL doesn’t want anything to do with him either.

In an early Sunday morning tweet storrm, Brown let the world know that he was done with the NFL. Hours later, an XFL source to Pro Football Talk told Mike Florio that the new league has no interest in Brown either.

As the New York Post reports, “The seven-time Pro Bowler was cut from the Patriots on Friday, 11 days after signing with the team. Brown is accused of sexual assault by Britney Taylor in a civil lawsuit. A second woman also came forward and accused Brown of sexual misconduct. She later claimed the 31-year-old had sent her “intimidating” text messages after going public with the allegations.”

It’s not unusual to see fledgling leagues sign high-profile players from the NFL. However, some of those high-profile players come with reputations that even new leagues aren’t willing to deal with. Apparently, the swirl of rape and sexual misconduct allegations around Brown were too much for the XFL.

The NFL’s investigation into the accusations against Brown, however, will continue.

Brown went off on the league in a series of tweets on Sunday announcing the end of his NFL career and pointedly noting the reported sexual misconduct of the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger and Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

Brown slammed the league for lacking loyalty and canceling deals with what he seems to feel is the drop of a hat in a tweet where he also seemed to say his football playing days are over. In addition, Brown hinted that he may file a grievance with the player’s union over his firing by the Patriots.

“Will not be playing in the @NFL anymore,” Brown tweeted on September 22, “these owners can cancel deals do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2 months will see if they pay up!”

Brown was released by the Patriots last week after two women came forward to accuse him of sexual assault. Aside from all the “guaranteed money” he lost by jumping from team to team, Brown also went after the sexual abuse problems of several members of the league.

The National Federation of State High School Associations said 80 percent of officials quit before they reached the third-year mark on the job.

A Fox News report stated, “One driving force behind the trend is increasingly abusive and belligerent behavior by parents, including verbal abuse, threats and even fights.”

In June, Breitbart News reported that a brawl broke out between parents at a youth baseball game in Lakewood, Colorado, after a teenage umpire made some “questionable calls”:

These adults took over the field and began assaulting each other on 6/15 during a youth baseball game. We're looking for any info, in particular to ID the man in the white shirt/teal shorts.

The Lakewood Police Department said it later identified the 12 individuals involved in the incident and cited them for disorderly conduct.

On September 14, two people were wounded when a gunman opened fire at a peewee football game in Fort Worth, Texas, according to Breitbart News.

The report said when a fight began between players on the field, a mother allegedly called her older son, who arrived soon after with a firearm and proceeded to shoot.

“[The gunman] was shooting at our sideline,” said coach Jonathan Cunningham. “He was standing at the top of the hill. You could see him pointing down shooting directly at the kids. So we checked on our players, our kids, making sure everyone was OK. That’s when we noticed one of our parents was shot.”

High school baseball umpire Bob Player, who’s been on the field for 34 years in Long Island, New York, said true sportsmanship is becoming a thing of the past.

“Sportsmanship over the past several years is getting much worse on the field,” Player said. “It’s something you almost deal with in every game in one way, shape or form.”

Player said officials are quitting at record rates due to the verbal abuse and threats they receive on a regular basis.

“[They say] I just can’t take it anymore, it’s just not worth it,” he concluded."

The Senate passed S.J. Res. 54, 54-41, which would terminate President Trump’s national emergency declaration on the southern border. The resolution was created by Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and co-sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Susan Collins (R-ME).

Sen. Collins said the bill is not about “whether you’re for or against a border wall.” The Maine senator, who is up for a tough reelection fight in 2020, claimed that she has “consistently supported” funding for physical barriers on the southern border.

However, Congress has failed to provide significant funding to help secure America’s southern border by building a border wall. With Congress’ failure to provide funding, President Trump declared a national emergency to build the border wall, which diverted military funding so that the president can build a wall along the southern border.

The Republicans that voted for the resolution to end the national emergency to build a border wall are Sens. Collins, Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rob Portman (R-OH).

The vote arises as the Pentagon announced in September that they will delay or suspend 127 military construction projects so that $3.6 billion can be diverted to help secure America’s southern border.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that many Republicans might decide to vote with Democrats because local military bases’ funds have been diverted towards funding the wall.

“I don’t think anyone, no matter what state they are from, will want to see money being taken away from their military installations, [which is] very much needed,” Schumer said Tuesday.

Congressional Democrats failed to pass the resolution to override Trump’s national emergency in March, which failed to override the president’s veto.

“Toys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,” Kim Culmone, senior vice president of Mattel Fashion Doll Design, said in a statement. “Through research, we heard that kids don’t want their toys dictated by gender norms.”

When the company rolled out the dolls, Mattel toned down typically masculine and feminine features and featured kits addressed with the pronoun “they” and the slogan “A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in.”

“The battle lines are drawn,” a senior House GOP aide directly involved in the effort to expose Democrats on the floor with recorded votes told Breitbart News on Wednesday evening. “We now know where every member of the House is on impeachment. And we know it is purely partisan.”

While the procedures are slightly D.C. insider-sounding, this vote, forced by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, represents the first time the lower Chamber of Congress has officially gone on record with regard to the impeachment of Trump, and it forces vulnerable Democrats who were waffling on whether to publicly back removal of the president from office by force on the record in support of the radical leftist wing of the party.

“Democrats were caught off guard by this,” the GOP aide said. “They were not ready to go on the record. ”

Pelosi announced on Tuesday late afternoon that the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry of the president, a move she made via press conference. Traditionally, when considering impeachment of an executive branch official, up to and including the president of the United States, the House of Representatives will vote to formally open proceedings. It has done this three times in recent history.

But, because Pelosi attempted to shield vulnerable Democrat members from battleground districts, she did not–as House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) has pointed out repeatedly–hold a formal vote to open the proceedings officially.

There are no real impeachment proceedings ongoing because the House hasn’t voted to authorize them—and the speaker can’t launch an inquiry by fiat. The House should pass legislation that helps the American people instead of trying to sell an impeachment fiction to the public. pic.twitter.com/V0uS6kWkB8 — Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 25, 2019

Speaker Pelosi’s decree changes absolutely nothing. As I have been telling Chairman Nadler for weeks, merely claiming the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry doesn’t make it so. Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry. — Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 24, 2019

So, on Wednesday, McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, drafted a resolution formally condemning the way in which Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry.

The text of the resolution that McCarthy introduced is as follows:

Whereas at a press conference on September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stated: “Therefore today, I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” Whereas House Practice states that: “Under the modern practice, an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges against the officer in question.” Whereas in the past 25 years, the House of Representatives has moved forward with impeachment against a federal officer three times, each initiated by an impeachment inquiry resolution approved by the full House, not by a unilateral decree of the Speaker. Whereas on May 12, 2009, the House approved H. Res. 424, authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire whether the House should impeach Samuel B. Kent, a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Whereas on January 13, 2009, the House approved H. Res. 15, authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire whether the House should impeach G. Thomas Porteous, a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Whereas on October 8, 1998, the House approved H. Res. 581, authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to investigate whether sufficient grounds exist for the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States. Whereas the Committee Report to accompany H. Res. 581 stated: “Because the issue of impeachment is of such overwhelming importance, the Committee decided that it must receive authorization from the full House before proceeding on any further course of action.” Whereas that report further stated: “Because impeachment is delegated solely to the House of Representatives by the Constitution, the full House of Representatives should be involved in critical decision making regarding various stages of impeachment.” Whereas the Speaker’s extraordinary decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry without any debate or vote on such a resolution by the full House undermines the voting privileges afforded to each Member and the constituents they represent. Whereas this unprecedented and politically motivated decision by Speaker Pelosi represents an abuse of power and brings discredit to the House of Representatives: Now, therefore, be it Resolved: That the House of Representatives disapproves of the actions of the Speaker of the House, Mrs. Pelosi of California, to initiate an impeachment inquiry against the duly elected President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Since Democrats are in the majority, they control what votes happen on the floor. But as the GOP leader in the House of Representatives, even though he is in the minority, McCarthy has the ability–he is the only Republican with the ability–to force a vote on a privileged resolution almost immediately. So McCarthy did just that–he introduced the resolution as privileged and forced the full House of Representatives to vote on it on Wednesday evening:

Here is the text of the Rep. McCarthy (R-CA) @GOPLeader privileged resolution – pic.twitter.com/CMdedyGvgR — Republican Cloakroom (@RepCloakroom) September 25, 2019

HAPPENING NOW→ I'm introducing a privileged resolution for the House to vote on.

Read the full resolution↓ pic.twitter.com/9xgYoVAl8P — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) September 25, 2019

Democrats fought back against McCarthy’s efforts, pushing what’s called a motion to table McCarthy’s privileged resolution. That is where the vote of record happened–a vote for the motion to table was a vote against the resolution, and vice versa. The motion to table succeeded along party lines, with 231 House Democrats voting for it and 193 House Republicans voting against it. Former Republican, now “Independent” Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also voted with the Democrats. Five Republicans and three Democrats did not vote.

In other words, in plain English, the Democrats, by shooting down McCarthy’s resolution, have now formally all gone on the record in support of Pelosi’s impeachment inquiry–and the Republicans have now all gone on the record against it. Even more plainly, this was the vote that formally opened impeachment proceedings. They are all on the record now.

No Democrat in the House of Representatives now claim it is not their intention to attempt to remove the duly elected president of the United States from office by force rather than by an election. They also cannot be ambivalent about it anymore. There is no more splitting hairs, no more supporting an “investigation” without backing impeachment, no more saying they need more facts to figure out what’s next. All the cards are on the table: Every Democrat in the House supports removing Trump from office and not waiting until November 2020 to have an election.

What’s more, in perhaps good news for Trump, he lost zero Republicans. The GOP is unified behind its president. Impeachment being partisan is an optics win for Trump, as it feeds his narrative that the Democrats are power-hungry and cannot beat him at the ballot box, so they are using extraordinary measures to attempt to seize the office by force.

“The Democrats can’t hide anymore,” a second senior GOP aide told Breitbart News. “Every last one of them now has the blood of this failed coup all over their hands. And America can see it.”"

Many congressional Democrats publicly declared it the “smoking gun,” while Republicans dismissed their cries by noting the absence of quid pro quo or generally lawless behavior.

However, Democrats are striking a drastically different tone privately, as several reports indicate.

The far-left flank of the Democrat caucus forced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to concede and announce a formal impeachment inquiry against the president on Tuesday. She made the announcement prior to the release of the transcript, which detailed the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

As Republican lawmakers explicitly noted, the conversation contained “zero” grounds for a legitimate impeachment inquiry. The president’s request for a “favor,” Republicans added, was immediately followed by a reference to Crowdstrike and questions revolving around election meddling and hacking efforts. Joe Biden’s (D) son, Hunter Biden, was not mentioned until later in the conversation.

“President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating ‘Crowdstrike’ (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelensky, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond ‘Crowdstrike,'” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said in a statement, noting that Biden’s “possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son” was not mentioned until after the fact.

“Just read transcript of POTUS’ call w/Ukraine Pres. Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote. “This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!”

“Wow. Impeachment over this?” Rep Lindsey Graham (R-SC) expressed. “What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.”

Publicly, Democrats have claimed that the transcript is the “smoking gun,” accusing Trump of betrayal and calling him a “cheat,” while repeatedly taking the lines from the conversation out of context, attributing the “favor” to Biden’s son:

“I would like you to do us a favor”…”whatever you can do with [Barr] would be great.” This #UkraineTranscript is @realDonaldTrump’s version and he admitted to betrayal. America is too great of a country to be led by such a cheat. #ImpeachTrump — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) September 25, 2019

Spoiler alert: President Trump attempted to bribe and extort a foreign leader for political gain. This—and so many other infractions he’s committed against our Constitution—is why it’s time to #ImpeachTrumpNow.https://t.co/OnijHI0p0y — Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (@RepRashida) September 25, 2019

The transcript of the call reads like a classic mob shakedown: – We do a lot for Ukraine

– There’s not much reciprocity

– I have a favor to ask

– Investigate my opponent

– My people will be in touch Nice country you got there. It would be a shame if something happened to her. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 25, 2019

However, the public calls are overshadowed by reports of internal freakouts among Democrats, who believe this is a losing battle. As Breitbart News reported, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed hesitation and concern over the party’s decision to pull the trigger on impeachment. One senior Democrat congressional aide called the impeachment effort “a joke” and “all bullshit”:

Privately, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed concerns about the lack of a focus on the impeachment move; without a clear outcome in mind, Democrats fear that whatever happens will further energize Trump ahead of the 2020 election while failing to remove him. “If you’re going to take a shot at the king, you best not miss,” one House Democrat leadership aide told Breitbart News. “And we do not have a pathway to win without 20 GOP votes in the Senate. We are nowhere near that, not even close.” Another senior Democrat congressional aide added regarding the move to attempt to impeach Trump: “It’s a joke. It’s all bullshit.” Over on the Senate side, most Republicans are in line with Trump. While Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said that he considers the transcript’s contents “troubling,” he declined to discuss “impeachment” at this time.

Politico paralleled those sentiments, noting the “creeping anxiety throughout the party [that] it [impeachment] might only help the president clinch a second term.” The outlet spoke to several Democrat officials, who expressed that impeachment could very well backfire on Democrats.

“Of course, I want impeachment from a moral perspective,” Pete Buttigieg’s former New Hampshire director Michael Ceraso told Politico. “But from a political perspective, I don’t want to spend a year talking about how Democrats tried to impeach him and couldn’t pull it off.”

Instead of health care and kitchen-table economics — the issues the party ran on in last year’s blue-wave election — the campaign will inevitably be consumed by a doomed effort to boot Trump from office, skeptics say. All when Trump will be on the ballot in a matter of months, anyway “The Democrats become single-issue candidates, which weakens them,” Ceraso said, adding that the proceedings will only solidify Trump’s base.

Another Democrat strategist told Politico that Pelosi should have taken “one for the team” as she has been doing for months, rather than succumbing to the left’s call for an impeachment inquiry:

One Democratic strategist familiar with multiple presidential campaigns in Iowa said the party’s eventual nominee would be better served if House Democrats decline to open proceedings, even as candidates publicly urge them to. He reacted with alarm as Pelosi signaled Monday that she had become more open to the possibility of impeachment. “She needs to take one for the team and say, ‘Nope, we’re not doing it,’” the strategist said, before Pelosi greenlighted an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Another Democratic strategist with ties to the national party agreed. Holding the earlier Democratic line — with Democratic presidential candidates calling for impeachment and Pelosi declining to go there — would also help vulnerable Democratic House members with their reelection bids. “I think that works well for both Congress and the candidate because then [House members] can say they stand against the nominee,” the strategist said.

Even Sean Bagniewski, chairman of Iowa’s Polk County Democrats, signaled that Iowans at the Polk County Steak Fry did not have an appetite for impeachment.

“I talked to a lot of people, and it didn’t come up once, not at all,” he told Politico. “I’m sure it really energizes Twitter, but Twitter doesn’t vote.”

Bagniewski suggested that the endless impeachment efforts are distracting Democrats from issues that voters care about.

“The bread-and-butter issues are more important now than ever,” Bagniewski told Politico. “We all need to start deciding what we want to be spending our time on.”

His concerns are not isolated. The Democrat-led House has faced criticism for appearing to spend more time passing relatively meaningless resolutions while only paying lip service to “bread and butter” issues on their social media platforms.

Politico also cited Democrat strategist Hank Sheinkopf – who called impeachment a “national spectacle” – and Democratic National Committee member Bob Mulholland, who called impeachment a “political disaster for us Democrats”:

“It’s a national spectacle that will make people defend the presidency or tune out, which is worse,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime Democratic strategist based in New York. “The incessant banging about it doesn’t help. Stick with issues that work.” Bob Mulholland, a Democratic National Committee member from California, put it this way: “Absent Trump being caught in a trunk with a young boy, impeachment is a political disaster for us Democrats.”

Political analyst Charlie Cook noted that he was “totally underwhelmed by the transcript” and added that it will not help Democrats in their efforts to get Americans on board with impeaching the president:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters. — Charlie Cook (@CharlieCookDC) September 25, 2019

Even presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) went against the outspoken cries from her party, admitting that the transcript does not demonstrate a “compelling case” for impeachment:

NEW: @TulsiGabbard joined @krystalball and me this afternoon. She tell us that the transcript does NOT show a ""compelling case"" for impeaching @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Xyc39eQL2Z — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) September 25, 2019

As the fallout continues, Democrats are moving the goalposts, claiming that there no longer needs to be “no quid pro quo,” as Juan Williams concluded on Fox News’s The Five on Wednesday.

Despite the public cries of victory from certain Democrat lawmakers, Republicans smell blood.

Breitbart News reported:

“The Democrats are fucked,” a senior Senate GOP aide told Breitbart News upon reviewing the transcript. “This is going to unite everyone except maybe Mitt, I bet even Ben Sasse comes around on this and backs the president unless there’s some bombshell with the whistleblower who didn’t even hear this call. Republican operatives I’ve talked to are giddy about this.”

GOP lawmakers are using the left’s hysteria to their advantage, reminding the American people of the issues Democrats are ignoring – health care, border security, and homelessness – whilst distracting themselves with the endless list of grievances designed to take the president down:

As I travel across West Virginia, I talk to folks who are sick and tired of this purely partisan investigation aimed at reversing the results of the presidential election. It is time for Democrats to move on and start focusing on issues that matter to all Americans. — Rep. Alex Mooney (@RepAlexMooney) September 25, 2019

– It was the Ukrainian President who brought up Giuliani on the call AND – Democrats don't wait for the facts before they jump to conclusions when it comes to President @realdonaldtrump — Congresswoman Debbie Lesko (@RepDLesko) September 25, 2019

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) reminded the American people that Democrats have been actively searching for a catalyst to launch an impeachment inquiry since Trump’s inauguration.

“Since the day President Trump was elected, congressional Democrats have been working to find any reason under the sun to impeach the president and undo the results of the last election,” Cruz stated.

“First, it was Mueller, then the Mueller report found no collusion. Now it’s Ukraine. Next month, it will be something else,” he continued.

He added that “facts don’t matter to congressional Democrats” and predicted that Pelosi will “continue to be hounded by the far left of her caucus to halt all other legislative work to focus on attacking the president.”

As Breitbart News reported, Pelosi’s cave demonstrates that she lost the battle for control of her caucus, succumbing to the demands of the far-left “Squad.”

Additionally, the Trump campaign and RNC’s announcement of a combined $5 million raised since Pelosi’s initial launch of the impeachment inquiry essentially confirms the Democrat insiders’ mounting fears: The American public is not on board with impeachment, and the GOP – including Trump’s base – is ready for war."

A regulatory agency in D.C. has since dismissed the complaint.

Attorney Joshua A. Levy filed the complaint to D.C.’s Alcohol Beverage Control Board in June 2018 on behalf of eight purported D.C. residents, claiming that President Donald Trump had been breaking D.C. law by simply owning a business that maintains a liquor license, according to a report by ABC News.

Levy said when he filed the complaint last year:

President Trump is not above the law. In D.C., the law requires an owner of a liquor license to be of ‘good character,’ and Mr. Trump is not. He should transfer the ownership to someone who can comply with the law or show cause why his license should not be revoked.

The complainants argued that the Trump International Hotel in D.C. should be stripped of its liquor license due to the U.S. president’s alleged lack of “good character.”

“With each passing day, the story of Donald Trump’s lack of good character continues to play out in the public,” said Levy. “Residents of the district can and should come forward to urge the liquor board to reach the merits of this complaint.”

Arguments for the complaint were last heard on September 18.

“This is not about the neighborhood, not about the common good and certainly not about the law,” said Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, to ABC after the complaint was initially filed. “This is politics at its worst and an obvious effort to misuse the power of government to advance a political agenda.”

“The statute is clearly being distorted for political gain and the suggested interpretation would create an absurd precedent, not to mention a slippery slope,” he added.

The board has since dismissed the case on the basis of a residency requirement, and it did not end up making a decision on the merits of the claim, according to ABC, which added that the dismissal paperwork noted “that the purported group of eight residents and property owners does not contain at least five residents or property owners” within D.C.

According to the board, only four of the original complainants were found to have been residents and property owners in Washington, D.C., resulting in the case being dismissed.

In December of 2018, Kian, who is also known as Bijan Rafiekian, was indicted in Robert Mueller’s expansive federal probe of Russian Collusion, which ended up proving the whole thing was a hoax manufactured by Democrats and the media, but did ensnare people such as Kian and Michael Flynn, who was President Trump’s national security adviser.

In July of 2019, just eight months after the indictment, a Virginia jury convicted Kian of illegally lobbying in the U.S. on behalf of the Turkish government.

According to the Hill, Kian was facing 15 years in prison.

Hey, another Big Win for left-wing superhero Robert Mueller, right?

Except…

On Wednesday a federal judge overturned the entire verdict, based on a lack of evidence and inadequate instructions to the jury on “the use of hearsay statements, the role of Flynn or the knowledge required to convict Rafiekian on one of the charges.”

“The Government failed to present substantial evidence for a rational juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Rafekian knowingly participated in a conspiracy to…act as an unregistered agent of a foreign government…and make willful and material false statements and omissions in a FARA filing,” the judge wrote.

Prosecutors have not said if they will refile charges, but did release a statement, saying, “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is reviewing the Court’s opinion vacating the jury’s verdict in the Rafiekian matter. We do not have any further comment at this time.”

Think about the possible corruption at work here. It is extremely rare for a judge to overturn a verdict such as this, and the fact that the apparent corruption began with an indictment and lasted straight through to jury instructions is enough to take your breath away.

Robert Mueller and his crooked gang of extremist Democrats were on a vendetta to destroy anyone associated with Trump, and anyone associated with anyone associated with Trump. If they couldn’t indict them, the Mueller cabal tried to bankrupt them or intimidate them, as they did to Gen. Flynn.

Just one more example of the breathtaking abuse of power behind this coup and a corrupt media that aid and bet, rather than expose it.

Last week, the RNC announced “a record $23.5 million [raised] in August” as well as “$53.8 million cash on hand,” as Breitbart News reported.

The spike in fundraising follows the Democrat Party’s heavy push for impeachment, which remains widely unpopular among American voters, as recent polls indicate.

Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday after months of stiff-arming the efforts, telling Democrats in a caucus-wide call last month that the public “isn’t there” yet on impeachment. Nonetheless, the Speaker ultimately succumbed to demands, using the whistleblower complaint as a catalyst for the inquiry.

The transcript detailing Trump’s conversation with the Ukranian president, released Wednesday, showed no quid pro quo and no legitimate grounds for impeachment, as several Republican lawmakers pointed out.

“Since the day President Trump was elected, congressional Democrats have been working to find any reason under the sun to impeach the president and undo the results of the last election,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said in a statement Wednesday.

The president spoke about Biden during a press conference in New York City on Wednesday.

Trump pointed to the enormous pressure put on his administration and his staff by Democrats and the media, suggesting that Biden and his family experienced nothing similar.

“When you look at all of the trauma that these fakers have caused, and the press, look, much of the press is not only fake, it is corrupt,” he said. “These stories they write are corrupt. They’re so wrong and they know that.”

Trump said that House Democrats were vicious in their pursuit of his administration.

This 54 to 41 vote was not about the border wall, but whether “the Congress of the United States of America should yield its constitutionally prescribed power of the purse to the President,” said Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins.

“The answer to that question, regardless of who is in the White House … should be no,” Collins continued. “Congress alone is empowered by the constitution to adopt laws directing money from the U.S. Treasury.”

The president “stole” the money, and “I will not stand for that,” said Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy. The president took the funding from other projects, such as the replacement of older schools at military bases, said Leahy, who is the top Democrat on the appropriations panel.

Senators should vote against the resolution because “there is no Earthly reason why Democrats would force us to have one or the other,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).

“The joint resolution is passed,” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney announced from the Senate’s chair.

The 11 GOP senators who voted against the emergency and the wall included Collins, Romney, retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (TN), along with Sens. Roy Blunt (MO), Mike Lee (UT), Jerry Moran (KS), Lisa Murkowski (AK), Rand Paul (KY), Rob Portman (OH), Pat Toomey (PA), and Roger Wicker (MS).

Collins spoke during the brief debate and vote, saying she supported additional construction at the border.

Several GOP senators declined to vote.

Trump will likely veto the resolution, and the 54 votes in favor are not enough to overcome the president’s veto.

Trump announced the emergency in February after Democrats blocked the funding for the border wall. Trump’s emergency declaration uses powers that prior Congresses voted to give to the president."

But on the basis of one drama queen’s overreaction to a rumor she’d heard about what was said on a phone call she didn’t hear (I’m assuming the whistleblower is Christine Blasey Ford), the Democrats have launched impeachment proceedings against the president.

I guess they figured it’s easier than flying to South Dakota with picks and chisels and carving Trump into Mount Rushmore. But it will have the same effect.

Now that the transcript has been released, it’s the New York Times that doesn’t want anyone to see it.

The transcript I’d like to see is the one of Nancy Pelosi reading the Trump transcript.

F@@@@@@CK! Whose f***ing idea was it to demand this goddamn transcript?

F@CK!

F@@CK!

F@@@CK!

The absolute worst version for Trump — i.e. the one being repeated non-stop on MSNBC — is that he did exactly what Obama and Biden were doing to Ukraine: intimidating an ally into giving us something in exchange for the foreign aid we were giving them.

Biden himself bragged about getting Ukraine’s prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold a big fat check from them.

The Democrats’ argument is: No, no, no! When WE were pressuring Ukraine, we were doing it for good! Don’t you understand? We’re good; they’re bad.

The other reason the media are going to have to bury this transcript is that Trump brought up a few items that the media have been hoping the public would never find out about.

Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Well, that’s something the media haven’t mentioned before. Ninety-nine percent of Americans will be hearing about the funny business with Biden’s son, Hunter, for the first time with the release of this transcript.

Why did Vice President Biden order the Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor investigating the Ukrainian company paying his son millions of dollars? Are Democrats claiming that this company was clean as a whistle and it was an absolute OUTRAGE that it was being investigated?

Ukraine was looking into the company that conveniently placed Hunter Biden on its board long before Trump came on the scene. Something must have made the Ukrainian prosecutor want to investigate Biden’s company — and it sure wasn’t to curry favor with the Obama/Biden administration.

The second issue the media does not want anyone to think about is CrowdStrike.

What is CrowdStrike, you ask? That is the cybersecurity firm that is the sole source of the claim that the Russians hacked the DNC’s emails — which launched the conspiracy theories that tied our country in knots for the past three years.

The Russian collusion story was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 to cover up the utter corruption revealed by the dump of Democratic National Committee emails on Wikileaks. As was her practice whenever a scandal threatened to engulf her, Hillary rushed out and told the press to investigate something else.

And “the great story” about the DNC email hack wasn’t about a “vast right-wing conspiracy” — as she claimed when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. No, this time, it was a vast Russian conspiracy!

At the time, the entire media laughed at Hillary’s Russian conspiracy nonsense — the New York Times, New York Newsday, the Los Angeles Times, and so on. But then Trump won the election, and suddenly the Russia conspiracy seemed totally believable. What else could explain how Americans could put this boob in the White House?

The subsequent three years of breathless Russia coverage was based entirely on the word of one cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, that the DNC’s emails had been hacked by Russia.

Recall that the DNC wouldn’t allow the FBI or any other U.S. government official anywhere near its computers. That’s precisely why so many cybersecurity experts doubted that it was the Russians: The FBI was never allowed to perform its own investigation.

CrowdStrike was founded by Ukrainian Dmitri Alperovitch (now an American citizen apparently — because who isn’t?) and funded by the fanatically anti-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk Foundation.

Talk about interfering with our democracy! Alperovitch and Pinchuk sent one political party and nine-tenths of the American media off on a wild goose chase into Russian collusion that, after years of accusations, investigations and embarrassing conspiracy-mongering … turned up goose eggs.

The entire Russian insanity was launched by a couple of Ukrainians. I think a lot of us would like to get to the bottom of that.

This is why Trump said to President Zelensky: “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

(How’d you like to be the Ukrainian translator for a Trump conversation?)

Trump has been justly criticized for hiring his daughter and son-in-law at the White House. But at least when he pressures a foreign leader for a favor, it’s to investigate corruption, not to get a prosecutor off his son’s back. Maybe Biden’s son was guilty, maybe he was innocent. But it is a fact that Joe Biden held up foreign aid to a desperately needy ally in exchange for their halting prosecution that implicated his son. It’s not Trump’s fault that Biden is now running for president.

823,,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/25/sen-david-perdue-oks-silicon-valley-takeover-of-college-graduate-job-market/,2019-09-25T00:00:00,Sen. Perdue OKs Silicon Valley Takeover of College Graduate Job Market,"Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) now supports Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) green card giveaway bill, which will allow investors to reward many more Indian graduates for taking middle-class jobs from American college graduates.

Perdue’s decision to end his opposition to the bill clears the way for Lee to rush his bill through the Senate on Thursday. If no other senators object, Lee’s bill will move through the Senate, putting it much closer to becoming law.

The bill allows investors and their companies to reward many more Indian graduates who agree to take the college graduate jobs needed by young American graduates. The reward is the grant of 120,000 invaluable green cards — up from roughly 20,000 today — to the Indian outsourcing workers and their families.

That’s a huge boost for the investors in the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, who now import Indian graduates to spike stock prices by chopping white-collar payroll costs. So Perdue’s retreat is also a huge economic hit to the roughly 800,000 Americans who are graduating in 2019 with degrees in health care, science, engineering, accounting, business, software, math, or architecture.

The bill could also disrupt the immigration system for many other foreign migrants, including younger “dreamer” illegals and university scientists, as well as the next wave of foreign students, scientists, and professionals who are seeking to move into the United States. The House has already passed its version of the bill, H.R. 1044.

Perdue’s retreat was reported by Immigration Voice, a lobbying group of foreign workers who were imported by investors to take the middle-class jobs sought by U.S. graduates. The McClatchy News Service reported Perdue’s switch:

Georgia Sen. David Perdue says he no longer objects to Sen. Lee's green card bill: ""I supported his bill. It's consistent with what the White House has been working on. We just had some nuances in the language with regard to rural nurses and basically we worked that out."" — Bryan Lowry (@BryanLowry3) September 25, 2019

The Indian visa workers are now urging their members to call Sen. Dick Durbin’s (D-IL) office out of fear he might block Lee’s giveaway:

🚨ILLINOIS ACTION ITEM ALERT 🚨 Dear Friends, We need our members in Illinois to call Senator Dick Durbin in his Washington DC office at 202.224.2152 and ask him to support the unanimous consent of the bi-partisan Harris-Lee – Fairness For High Skilled immigrants act. Team IV — Immigration Voice (@immivoice) September 25, 2019

Durbin’s potential opposition was spotlighted by a September 7 report in the Wall Street Journal:

Democrats in the Senate have qualms, too. “They are increasing the immigration from countries like India a marginal small amount at the expense of cutting back on immigration from other countries in a much more dramatic fashion—I don’t think there’s equity in that,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).

Perdue’s office did not respond to Breitbart News. On September 19, Perdue explained his hold on Lee’s bill:

I want to comment my good friend from the great state of Utah, SM Lee, for his work on putting this bill together and pulling the people together to support this bill. I support this bill. Madam President. We have some language that needs to be clarified, and I still have some concerns about the impact this legislation would have on some specific industries, you know in my state but in the country. I want to work with Senator only in addressing these concerns and come to a resolution on this very quickly. I commit to working with him and his team to make sure that we get to a resolution because we want the exact same thing. And this is totally consistent with President [Donald] Trump is trying to do in as long term work to fix our broken immigration system in with that.

Activists say no GOP senators are ready to step forward to protect American graduates from the huge inflow of underpaid Indian graduates. Even populist senators such as Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) have avoided criticizing the investors’ stealthy no-hearing, no-debates rush to pass the bill.

Their passive stance comes amid a huge but stealthy push led by the technology companies and investors, such as Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and the Washington Post. The backers include Mark Zuckerberg, who met with Lee on September 19, on the same day that Perdue blocked his bill.

The demand by investors for endless migrant labor has created a new thing: The US-India Outsourcing Economy. This no-regulation zone redirects new wealth into a few cities & a small elite. Elites want to expand it, so US college-grads get #HR1044. https://t.co/4lWHtI3sUk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) July 19, 2019

Business groups have told senators that the bill is a minor change to immigration law and is intended to rectify what they describe as anti-Indian “country caps” discrimination. Those business groups already employ roughly 1.5 million foreign white-collar workers in the United States, including at least 800,000 Indians graduates.

Opponents and supporters of the green card giveaway are using Facebook and Twitter to urge their supporters to call senators to block or support the bill.

Only one GOP senator is needed to stop Lee’s bill, which is expected to be brought to the Senate floor on Thursday for a no-debate, no-media, fast-track “Unanimous Consent” approval process.

Few Democrats — if any — oppose Lee’s S.386 bill, which is strongly backed by the pro-Democrat Silicon Valley investors.

Nearly all Democrats voted for the House version of the bill.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have said they oppose the Indian outsourcing bill — but White House officials have not said if the bill will be opposed by President Donald Trump — even though Trump needs to boost his sagging support among white-collar suburban voters.

White-collar Americans have formed a series of groups to defend their careers against the investors’ visa workers. They include the American Workers Coalition, ProUSworkers, and Doctorswithoutjobs.com.

These groups say that the expanded number of green cards will flood the labor markets for engineers and software experts. The bill will also allow U.S. investors to annually recruit hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates to compete for American college jobs and green cards. The Indians can get work permits via the uncapped Optional Practical Training (OPT), B1, L-1, H4EAD, and H-1B visa worker programs. U.S. workers also say they are routinely discriminated against and excluded by the U.S.-based Indian managers and Indian recruiters who run the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy.

Lou Dobbs, on Fox News, has repeatedly denounced the giveaway:

#AmericaFirst– @EdRollins: @POTUS has made a commitment to create jobs for Americans, particularly young Americans coming out of college. This Senate bill would create competition for them by giving visas to Indian students & give them jobs at lower wages. #NOS386 #MAGA #Dobbs pic.twitter.com/ipZuAlQllv — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) September 23, 2019

Populist groups — such as Americans for Legal Immigration PAC — also oppose the Silicon Valley takeover.

Additionally, would-be immigrants are opposing the Lee bill because it will push the investors’ current army of at least 300,000 Indian tech workers — plus more to come — up to the head of the line for 120,000 green cards each year. For example, the Multinational Coalition includes many Chinese graduate students who will have to work as low-wage student lab technicians for many years in their late 20s if they hope to get green cards.

These pro-migration opponents of Lee’s bill also include Support All of Us and many other pro-migration groups who are keeping their opposition quiet.

This shift towards Indian outsourcing will also cut off the flow of employer-sponsored migrants into Florida’s Spanish-speaking economy, say immigration lawyers in Florida.

This bill is a giveaway overwhelmingly to one industry (tech) and it means that individuals from one country (India) will get most to all of the employment-based visas for the next 10 years, within even longer backlogs after that. — Amy Maldonado (@AmyMaldonadoLaw) September 25, 2019

But Perdue’s shift is being cheered by the India visa workers who take the graduate jobs needed by Americans. For example, “Ramesh S,” who is working in North Carolina, applauded Perdue’s switch:

Thank you 🙏, @sendavidperdue for hearing us and agreeing to support and co-sponsor S386 bill. pic.twitter.com/Y3LxPfLZeg — Ramesh S (@chandar2020) September 25, 2019

Most of the Indian workers are being imported to run the U.S. side of the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, which is used by investors to transfer Americans’ salaries into their Wall Street stock values.

For example, Walmart is boosting its stock value by outsourcing 569 finance and accounting jobs in North Carolina to cheaper H-1B workers from India. If the company saves $10,000 per employee, Walmart will save $5.7 million per year. On Wall Street, Walmart’s price to earnings rate is 25 to one, so the $5.7 million in payroll savings will boost its stockholders’ value by $142 million.

Walmart picked an American company, Genpact, to supply the Indian workers. The company is a spin-off of General Electric, and it prospers by providing Indian H-1B workers to many companies in the United States. For example, the company asked for 271 H-1Bs in 2018, 410 H-1Bs in 2017, and 307 H-1Bs in 2016.

Genpact’s H-1Bs work on the U.S. side of the vast and growing U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy, now worth roughly $78 billion per year. Part of the H-1Bs’ job is to funnel additional work back into India. For example, Genpact may only need to use 100 H-1Bs in North Carolina to help steer the work of the 569 fired American finance experts back to large teams of low-wage Indian graduates in India.

Genpact’s $3.3 billion in revenue is enough to generate $7.5 billion in stock value for its investors, which include Bain Capital, Blackrock, and Charles Schwab Investment Management.

Employers reward the low-wage Indian workers by giving them green cards, which allow them to become U.S. citizens — and to then import their immediate and extended families from India to the United States.

The investors are mostly based on the coasts, so their wealth is helping to spike income and real estate values in New York and California — while the reduced investment and payroll in heartland states reduce their business income, real estate values, skilled workforces, and political power.

H-1B imported workers in Georgia get paid less than Americans, so they spend less (about $300M less) on local groceries, retail, rents, etc. Investors send the savings to Wall St. to get 25:1 gains. IOW, visa workers hurt many & help the few wealthy @S386 https://t.co/LI7eHEAfN3 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 25, 2019

Immigration Numbers

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.

But Trump’s “Hire American” policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full-time, year-round work."

The fake story, which ran Wednesday afternoon, claims:

The acting Director of National Intelligence [Joseph Maguire] threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.

The story was published just hours after the White House released the transcript of a call between Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. The transcript debunked the latest Media-Democrat hoax that claims Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The actual transcript shows no such thing, and during a press conference with Trump on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president confirmed he was not pressured.

Just moments after the Post’s phony story ran, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement on Twitter that says of the Post story, “This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.”

This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond. This is actually not true.

A few moments later, Maguire himself released a statement debunking the Post’s fake news: “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community…”

Maguire statement:

Throughout the nearly three years of the media’s Russia Collusion Hoax, along with CNN and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, the Post was one of the leading purveyors of fake news, including a ludicrous story about the Russians hacking into a Vermont power grid.

Then there was the Post’s now-debunked claim the Obama administration did not spy on Trump (it did), and the phony claim the Trump campaign changed its platform on Ukraine to appease Putin (it didn’t). On top of that nonsense was the Post’s ludicrous fake news about Russia hacking the election systems of 21 states, the claim there is a lot of evidence of Trump-Russia collusion (there is none), the whopper about Trump revealing classified information to the Russians (he did not), and this extra large whopper: “Rudy Giuliani just told America that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia.”

The full list is here.

Publishing a flurry of fake news as one of its hoaxes collapses, in this case the Ukraine Hoax, is standard operating procedure for the Washington Post and the rest of our crooked news media. The idea is to distract from the debunking of the primary hoax with a chaos narrative that hurls anything against the wall. This garbage never sticks, but it does allow our fake media to hold on to the dream that they really got Drumpf this time a little while longer.

In a letter to Columbia University President Lee Bollinger, Lauder said the last straw for him was the university’s invitation to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, who is slated to speak on campus on Wednesday. Mohamed is known for his extremist views and for repeatedly espousing antisemitism, including smearing Jews as “hook-nosed” and claiming “Jews rule the world by proxy.”

Amid calls from opponents of antisemitism to nix the visit, Bollinger defended the invitation, writing in a letter to student groups that “this form of open engagement can sometimes be difficult, even painful.”

“But to abandon this activity would be to limit severely our capacity to understand and confront the world as it is, which is a central and utterly serious mission for any academic institution,” Bollinger argued.

In his letter to Bollinger, Lauder retorted, “I understand, from your statement, that you believe it is in the interest of education that all views are aired at Columbia. With all the world leaders and statesmen in New York this week, I wonder why this man’s views are so vital?”

The Jewish leader called on donors to withhold future contributions:

I am not a Columbia alum. I went to Penn and my family and I have been among its largest benefactors. I will honestly tell you that if Amy Gutmann at Penn were as consistent in allowing antisemitic speakers on her campus as you are at Columbia, I would seriously consider stopping my funding. Accordingly, I will be encouraging all of my friends to immediately cease any of their contributions to your institution until such a time as antisemitic despots are no longer welcome on your campus.

Columbia and Bollinger faced widespread criticism in September 2007 for playing host to then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, infamous for denying the Holocaust, rejecting Israel’s right to exist and calling for the Jewish state’s destruction. Iran is a leading state sponsor of worldwide terrorism.

Lauder noted Ahmadinejad’s speech as well as instances of pro-Israel students reportedly facing an atmosphere of intimidation.

The World Jewish Congress leader wrote:

I have watched, with growing concern, the incidents and incitement directed against Israel on the Columbia campus, that are nominally called political activity, which have made many Jewish students on your campus less than comfortable. Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, have been understandably upset with this ongoing situation at Columbia, because the complaints from students have grown, along with the increased vitriol against them. So with that as the backdrop, along with the 2007 speech by a hate filled, Holocaust-denying Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, I am joining the growing chorus of those upset over your giving Mohamed an opportunity to air his anti-Semitism on your campus.

In his response to critics, Bollinger wrote that Mohamed’s invitation should not be taken as “validation” or an “endorsement” of the politician’s views.

“I find the anti-semitic statements of Prime Minister Mahathir to be abhorrently contrary to what we stand for, and deserving condemnation. Nevertheless, it is in these times that we are most strongly resolved to insist that our campus remain an open forum and to protect the freedoms essential to our university community,” Bollinger wrote."
827,,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/09/24/watch-aaron-klein-iran-might-take-advantage-of-political-chaos-in-israel/,2019-09-24T00:00:00,Klein: Iran Might Take Advantage of Political Chaos in Israel,"Iran might see an opportunity in the political chaos engulfing Israel following the latest election there to attempt to further destabilize the Middle East, warned Aaron Klein, Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Speaking on Israel’s i24NEWS (video above), Klein said that as long as Israel does not have a stable, permanent government in place Iran might feel it can get away with escalating regional tensions.

“I will tell you one party at least that is not going to sit around and wait. And that is Iran,” stated Klein.

“What is happening in the Middle East today is very serious. Iran is brazen. They are out of control. And I think that they could smell an opportunity coming out of Israel if a unity government or some sort of stable coalition isn’t formed very quickly. Iran is not going to sit around and wait for a unity deal.”

Last week’s national elections left both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party unable to form a coalition without agreeing to a unity deal between them. Israel is currently ruled by an interim government led by Netanyahu.

During the election campaign, Gantz said that he is open to a unity coalition with Likud if the party first ousts Netanyahu, who faced an indictment hearing next week regarding allegations of bribery and corruption. Netanyahu has strongly denied the allegations and can legally serve as prime minister unless any formal conviction takes place and that could take over a year.

Netanyahu is negotiating with a bloc of religious and nationalist parties and would not agree to a unity coalition if he is not the head of Likud.

There is also the issue of whether any unity deal would see Gantz and Netanyahu rotate the premiership and which leader will first be tasked by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to attempt to form a coalition that must consist of more than 60 seats in the 120 seat Knesset.

Iran two weeks ago was fingered for carrying out aerial strikes on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.

Klein, meanwhile, argued that the biggest loser of the latest election was the Israeli left, with results slated to be finalized tomorrow. Left wing parties have traditionally made the creation of a Palestinian state into a major policy objective.

The Labor-Gesher alliance is projected to only get 6 seats, a devastating fall from grace for Israel’s Labor party which historically was the largest or second largest party in the Knesset. Labor needed to run in a coalition with Gesher so it didn’t fall below the threshold of not winning enough votes to enter the Knesset.

The leftist Meretz party also needed to merge with another leftist party to form the Democratic Union in order to get enough seats to enter the Knesset with a four seat minimum. The union of those parties is only slated to win five seats.

Asked by the i24NEWS host if it would be better for Netanyahu to get the “first crack” at forming a coalition, Klein replied: “I think whether he gets the first crack or the second crack at the end of the day the Israeli electorate spoke and they want, it seems, a unity government.”

“You look, though, at the results of this election. This clearly was a loss for the left in Israel or what’s left of the left. So it seems like the dividing lines are more along religious. Ultra-religious versus secular and not right-left.”"

Mike Lee’s (R-UT) effort to allow India and China to monopolize the United States’ green card system.

Lee’s S. 386 provides a massive giveaway to Big Tech corporations like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft — all of which are donors to the Utah Senator.

The legislation will ensure outsourcing firms such as Cognizant and Infosys, as well as giant tech conglomerates like Amazon and Facebook, have a green card system wherein employers would have to wait seven to eight years before securing an employment-based green card for a hire.

This process would solidify that employment-based green cards only go to temporary foreign visa workers, like those imported on the H-1B visa, thus rewarding those corporations who replace their American employees with H-1B foreign visa workers who are overwhelmingly Indian male nationals.

While about 25 percent of all employment-based green cards currently are rewarded to Indian nationals today, should Lee’s legislation pass, Indian nationals will obtain more than 90 percent of all the employment-based green cards for at least a decade.

Paying out lobbyists to push Republican and Democrat Senators into supporting Lee’s green card giveaway are tech corporations like Google, Microsoft, the Oracle Corporation, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. For instance, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard have sent out a combined total of 18 lobbyists to Capitol Hill to push Lee’s green card giveaway out to Senators.

At the same time, Microsoft has been Lee’s largest tech donor for the last five election cycles, doling out nearly $130,000 to him since 2015. More than $97,000 of those funds went directly to Lee while another $30,000 went to Lee’s PAC.

Likewise, Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. has donated $55,900 to Lee since 2015, while the Oracle Corporation has donated $44,200.

Others bankrolling Lee’s S. 386 are the Koch brothers’ network of organizations, such as Americans for Prosperity, the outsourcing lobby, like Cognizant and the IBM Corporation, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The Chamber of Commerce, for example, has almost 30 lobbyists working to push Lee’s green card giveaway, while Cognizant and IBM have a total of seven lobbyists pushing the legislation. IBM and Cognizant are set to gain hugely from S. 386, as they are two of the largest outsourcers of American jobs in the nation.

This year, alone, Cognizant sought to outsource more than 13,000 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers. IBM — headed by Ginni Rometty who takes in a salary of $16.45 million a year — attempted to outsource nearly 8,500 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers.

The Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity, which has deployed eight lobbyists to push Lee’s green card giveaway, has indirectly been a donor to Lee through the years. Since 2015, Lee has raked in nearly $60,000 from Koch Industries.

Lee’s S. 386 is also being lobbied for by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), which aids illegal aliens and foreign workers in their efforts to not be deported, has sent out three lobbyists to push the green card giveaway.

Though S. 386 was blocked by Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), Lee and Perdue are expected to make a deal on the legislation and hope to take fast-track a vote by the end of this week.

An unnamed child was harassed and then pursued to her house by a coyote that wandered into the Chicago suburbs. Surveillance footage shows her skipping along her driveway, and then diverting toward a swing hanging from a tree in the front lawn.



As she approached the swing, a coyote dashes at her. Alarmed, she turns and runs for her house, pursued by the lunging predator.

The village of Villa Park announced that it had contacted both the DuPage County Forest Preserve and the Illinois Conservation Police regarding the incident. “Like domestic dogs, coyotes test their limits around humans and learn something from each exchange,” the preserve says on its official site:

Unless they associate people with negative experiences, such as loud noises, they can become comfortable walking down streets or sidewalks or near schools, basking in yards or parks, and shortening the distance between themselves and humans.

“A bold coyote does not necessarily mean an aggressive coyote,” the organization writes, “but a coyote that maintains its fear of humans will be less likely to cause problems.”

The girl’s family has confirmed that she is frightened but otherwise unharmed."

Less than two weeks ago, King was a hero after he turned a moment of fleeting fame into a movement that raised over $1.14 million for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital.

On September 13, King, who is now 24, was featured on ESPN College Game Day holding a sign that read “Busch Light supply need replenished. Venmo Carson-King-25.” The national attention resulted in donors from all over contributing money to King’s Venmo account.

Rather than keep the money, King said he would donate it to the children’s hospital. This is when Anheuser-Busch and Venmo agreed to match his donation.

So here’s a young man turning a goof that could have personally enriched him into a legitimately good thing…

Enter the media.

Specifically the Des Moines Register.

For whatever sadistic reason, the Register decided to do a “background check” of a private citizen thrust into the national spotlight and, lo and behold, what they uncovered were a couple of racially-insensitive tweets King fired off when he was 16, when he was still a sophomore in high school.

The paper contacted King to tell him they were going to run with the story. Obviously worried about his reputation, King tried to get ahead of the scandal by releasing the following statement:

It was just 10 days ago that I was a guy in the crowd holding a sign looking for beer money on ESPN Game Day. Since then – so much has happened. Especially when I announced all of the money would be donated to the Stead Family Children’s Hospital in Iowa City. Thousands of people have donated and today the account is at 1.14 million dollars. Much of this has happened thanks to social media – it has the power to bring people together for a common good. It also can make your life very public. And that is why I wanted to share with you that eight years ago – when I was a sophomore in high school, I made some social media posts with my friends that quoted and referenced the show Tosh.0. One of those posts was brought to my attention by a member of the media today. I had no recollection of it. In re-reading it today – eight years later – I see it was an attempt at humor that was offensive and hurtful. I am so embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16 years old. I want to sincerely apologize. Thankfully, high school kids grow up and hopefully become responsible and caring adults. I think my feelings are better summed up by a post from just 3 years ago: “Until we as a people learn that racism and hate are learned behaviors, we won’t get rid of it. Tolerance towards others is the first step.” — July 8, 2016 I am sharing this information tonight because I feel a responsibility to all of the people who have donated money. I cannot go back and change what I posted when I was a 16-year-old. I can apologize and work to improve every day and make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. And, I am so very thankful for the generosity of the thousands of people who have donated to our fundraising push for the Stead Family Children’s Hospital.

Apparently the tweets, which are no longer available, compared black people to gorillas.

The ever-gracious King later released a statement saying he was not angry at the Des Moines Register. King continued:

The Des Moines Register has been nothing but kind in all of their coverage, and I appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me. I want everyone to understand that this was my decision to publicly address the posts and apologize. I believe that is the right thing to do.

Almost immediately, those profiles in courage at Anheuser-Busch cut all ties with King. The company says it will still match his contribution. King says he will still donate the money.

Here’s the statement from the beer company:

Carson King had multiple social media posts that do not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him. We are honoring our commitment by donating more than $350,000 to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.

And then, in a fascinating turn of events that personifies our unforgiving Woke Culture, after the Register piece ran, the Internet dug up a number of offensive tweets published by the same reporter, Aaron Calvin, who dug up King’s tweets.

Calvin has now locked up his Twitter account and the Register says it is aware of the tweets and is looking into them.

One of Calvin’s tweets from 2012 reads, “Can I be a guest instructor at your theater camp teaching the kids how to abuse substances and ‘turn tricks.’”

A tweet from 2013 says, “I want to grow up and read sex stories to high school students.”

According to Twitchy, one of Calvin’s 2011 tweets uses the word “niggas.”

Welcome to the future, y’all…

Anything King might have tweeted after he became a legal adult… Fine. If you must… Fine. Let’s not forget we are talking about an everyday guy guilty of doing nothing more than turning a joke at a sporting event into an objectively good thing, but… Fine.

But now we live in a world where your juvenile criminal record is expunged, but not your juvenile tweets, which means a whole lot of good people who made some dumb mistakes as minors (as we all have) are going to see their reputations burnt to the ground in this unforgiving, witch-hunt culture of ours.

And nothing can be done about it, because there is no way to turn the Twitter Fascists and Virtue Signalers into decent human beings, and there’s no way to inject a spine or sense of decency into big companies like Anheuser-Busch.

The IOC had hoped that their scientific advisors could agree to halve the permitted levels of testosterone in transgender athletes, but the experts could not agree, according to the Guardian.

The current guidelines issued in 2015 maintain that men claiming to be transgender women can compete in the female categories even if they have not completed the transformational surgery only if their testosterone level measures below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before competing.

While some of the IOC’s experts insisted that the current requirements could be lowered further without creating an unfair playing field, others are pointing to recent research which claims that testosterone levels really have little effect on a transgender woman’s biologically male muscle strength.

The Guardian reports that the IOC’s experts went around and around over the issue but could not agree that the new guidelines are warranted.

Another source told the paper that the IOC still has hopes of getting a consensus, but agreement “proved far more difficult than expected because this is such a tricky political and emotive issue.”

In nearly every area of sports where former men compete as women, they have become instant champions over the biological female athletes. From U.S. high school sports, to international cycling competition, to Australian handball, to New Zealand weight lifting, nearly every time a biological male enters women’s categories, biological females lose.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Wednesday addressed reporters after viewing a federal employee’s complaint about President Donald Trump’s telephone conversation with the leader of Ukraine, claiming it “exposed serious wrongdoing.”

House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff speaks after reviewing the whistleblower complaint https://t.co/aYIcGo5zvO pic.twitter.com/Eh0qU5Et4b — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 25, 2019

In his remarks, Schiff described the complaint as “well-written” and praised the still-anonymous individual who authored the complaint as brave.

“What this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing, and I think it a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it was, because it was an urgent matter, it is an urgent matter,” he said.

The complaint, received by acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire a number of weeks ago, alleges that President Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden, back in July.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Although Schiff stands behind the so-called “whistleblower’s” crediblity, the Department of Justice on Wednesday confirmed that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found the individual who made the complaint has a “political bias” that was “in favor of a rival political candidate.”

According to a memo released by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, the inspector general stated that it received a complaint of “urgent concern,” though the OLC determined the matter “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” or require that the national intelligence director send the complaint to House and Senate intelligence committees.

During a joint press conference at the United Nations, both President Trump and Zelensky confirmed the conversation occurred and affirmed no pressure was applied to probe the Biden family. “I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.

Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the call, which shows the pair discussed U.S. military aid to Ukraine and Hunter Biden — and there was no quid pro quo discussed at any point of the conversation.

Nonetheless, the call prompted a group of House Democrats to come out in favor of impeachment and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to endorse a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.

Asked for his thoughts on the move by Pelosi, President Trump suggested the California Democrat has lost control of her caucus.

“[Speaker Pelosi’s] been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party. You take a look at what’s happening in the media today. The whole party is taken over by the left and thank you very much — my poll numbers have gone up,” he said.

Of the impeachment probe, House Republican leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News that Democrats “lost their minds” and predicted it will “backfire on them” in the 2020 election.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” said McCarthy. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”"

Ever since Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, Democrats have been on a mission to reverse those results, even though it’s meant dragging the country through one desperate witch hunt after another.

Now we turn the page to the latest chapter, with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announcing “an official impeachment inquiry” stemming in part from concerns over a secondhand report of a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that neither Democrats nor apparently their source had yet even seen – and despite President Trump previously stating he would release the transcript of the call today.

I’ve heard the president both in private and repeatedly in public call for European countries to pay their fair share for NATO and for the defense of Ukraine. Having the U.S. pay less and our allies pay more has been a consistent theme of the president’s since he ran for office, and it should surprise no one that he hit on the need for Europe to play a larger role once again in the transcript he indeed released this morning.

What the transcript confirms he did not do on the call, and what much of the controversy has been about, was condition U.S. aid on Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

If the Democrats want to argue the threat is implied, well, they may want to check the stability of the moral high ground they claim to be standing on, as Democrats are guilty of the exact same behavior they want to impeach the president for.

In an op-ed for the Washington Post on Tuesday, Marc Thiessen highlighted a letter several Democrat senators sent to Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine’s prosecutor general, saying they “are writing to express great concern about reports that your office has taken steps to impede cooperation with the investigation of United States Special Counsel Robert Mueller.”

After stating, “Ours is a relationship built on a foundation of respect for the rule of law and accountable democratic institutions,” and reiterating their support for Ukraine’s “capacity-building process” regarding those ideas, they note their “disappoint[ment] that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these principles in order to avoid the ire of President Trump.”

They then write, “If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

Thiessen rightfully asks, “So, it’s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it’s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?”

Or how about instances such as Democrats pushing the Ukrainian president “not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani” and “warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington”?

We must ask some other key questions.

For one, is there really something wrong with making aid contingent on behavior? Shouldn’t it be made clear to the new Ukrainian president that our aid is contingent on them not being corrupt?

Shouldn’t we want the European Union to send their fair share of aid instead of our government taking more and more resources from the American taxpayer?

Shouldn’t we want to get to the bottom of what Ukraine knows, including lingering details from the Russia investigation?

Shouldn’t we want to know why a foreign oligarch suspected of corruption was paying the then-sitting vice president’s son $50,000 a month?

Shouldn’t we want to know why the former vice president — on video — bragged about getting the prosecutor fired who was tasked with investigating that corruption?

How is it okay for Vice President Biden or Democrat senators to threaten aid to Ukraine but somehow impeachable for a president to allegedly do so?

The fact that House Democrats and the liberal media screeched for impeachment BEFORE even knowing a thing about what did or did not happen — that tells me we are in for another partisan ride, led by people who cannot and will not concede that Donald Trump is their president.

Finally, let’s consider the question I asked at the beginning: when will it end?

Simply put, never. The transcript will not be enough. The full whistleblower complaint, which I support Congress receiving, will not be enough. Testimony from the whistleblower – even if every single employee of the national security state testified in front of Congress on any topic – would not be enough. If there’s nothing to be found here, Democrats will simply try to find something else or return to old accusations.

The hatred for the Trump presidency runs deep on the left, and hate is consuming. It’s consuming Congress’ energy and time and the American people’s patience, for starters, and it’s time for the games to stop."

Josh Hawley (R-MO) slammed leftist “reporters” at HuffPost Tuesday for twisting and distorting facts to “advance their agenda.”

Sen. Hawley called out a dishonest HuffPost reporter for a reportedly biased interview with him regarding whether President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “to help win an election.”

Hawley questioned the premise, asking, “Is that what he did?”

The Missouri senator added, “He asked them for help with an election? Can you send me that?”

The HuffPost reporter then gave a printout of President Trump speaking about his July conversation with Zelensky regarding an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and that Biden threatened to withhold American foreign aid if the government did not fire the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden for allegedly corrupt business deals in Ukraine.

The HuffPost reporter then complained that the Missouri senator drew a distinction between the president asking about the government’s investigation into Hunter Biden and “asking a foreign government to help him win an election.”

“As tho [sic] those are different things,” the reporter remarked.

I think his issue is that I described the president asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden as the president asking a foreign government to help him win an election, as tho those are different things — Arthur Delaney (@ArthurDelaneyHP) September 24, 2019

Sen. Hawley fired back at the HuffPost reporter, calling him out for his alleged bias against the president.

“Just admit you want to see the President impeached – and you’re willing to distort & mislead to get it done,” Hawley wrote.

Sen. Hawley then released the transcript of his interview with the HuffPost reporter, contending that leftist “reporters” will “twist words and distort facts to advance their agenda.”

As the House moves towards impeaching the president, Sen. Hawley noted that, while America faces substantial problems across the nation, including a southern border crisis and drug addiction, the Democrats’ top priority is to impeach the president.

“We face a crisis on the southern border, a crisis of meth pouring into our towns, a crisis of youth suicide, an epic fight with China for our jobs and maybe our national security — and the Democrats’ top priority is to … impeach @realDonaldTrump,” Hawley wrote. “Says it all.”

Josh Hawley (R-MO) slammed leftist “reporters” at HuffPost Tuesday for twisting and distorting facts to “advance their agenda.”

Sen. Hawley called out a dishonest HuffPost reporter for a reportedly biased interview with him regarding whether President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “to help win an election.”

Hawley questioned the premise, asking, “Is that what he did?”

The Missouri senator added, “He asked them for help with an election? Can you send me that?”

The HuffPost reporter then gave a printout of President Trump speaking about his July conversation with Zelensky regarding an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and that Biden threatened to withhold American foreign aid if the government did not fire the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden for allegedly corrupt business deals in Ukraine.

The HuffPost reporter then complained that the Missouri senator drew a distinction between the president asking about the government’s investigation into Hunter Biden and “asking a foreign government to help him win an election.”

“As tho [sic] those are different things,” the reporter remarked.

I think his issue is that I described the president asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden as the president asking a foreign government to help him win an election, as tho those are different things — Arthur Delaney (@ArthurDelaneyHP) September 24, 2019

Sen. Hawley fired back at the HuffPost reporter, calling him out for his alleged bias against the president.

“Just admit you want to see the President impeached – and you’re willing to distort & mislead to get it done,” Hawley wrote.

Sen. Hawley then released the transcript of his interview with the HuffPost reporter, contending that leftist “reporters” will “twist words and distort facts to advance their agenda.”

As the House moves towards impeaching the president, Sen. Hawley noted that, while America faces substantial problems across the nation, including a southern border crisis and drug addiction, the Democrats’ top priority is to impeach the president.

“We face a crisis on the southern border, a crisis of meth pouring into our towns, a crisis of youth suicide, an epic fight with China for our jobs and maybe our national security — and the Democrats’ top priority is to … impeach @realDonaldTrump,” Hawley wrote. “Says it all.”

The U.S. Army confirmed the warning to Gizmodo on Tuesday after social media postings by suspected incels (involuntary celibates) were uncovered by the FBI.

In a September 18th email, service members were “instructed to remain aware of their surroundings and identify two escape routes when entering theaters.”

“Run if you can,” the memo read. “If you’re stuck, hide (also known as ‘sheltering in place’), and stay quiet. If a shooter finds you, fight with whatever you can.”

An Army Spokesperson told the outlet: “We do this routinely because the safety and security of our workforce are paramount. We want our workforce to be prepared and diligent on personal safety both inside the workplace and out.”

The threat of violence also evokes memories of the 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a screening of the film Batman: Dark Knight Rises, where the Joker character was a gun-wielding criminal mastermind.

The upcoming Joker film has been criticized by the relatives of those killed in a 2012 mass shooting, who wrote to Warner Bros. demanding that the company make a donation to charities supporting victims of gun violence.

“We are calling on you to be a part of the growing chorus of corporate leaders who understand that they have a social responsibility to keep us all safe,” the Survivors Empowered group wrote in a letter to company CEO Ann Sarnoff."

Barbara Boxer’s (D-CA) PAC For a Change, the Hollywood Reporter revealed Tuesday.

Boxer spoke to the Hollywood Reporter, telling the outlet that the event was inspired by The Investigation: A Search for the Truth in Ten Acts — a play that featured a slew of actors and actresses including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Sigourney Weaver, Wilson Cruz, John Lithgow, and many others.

“A West Coast version has now been set, and that’s why Boxer was on the line, to confirm the details and offer her take on why this fundraiser production is even more important in the wake of Tuesday’s news,” the Hollywood Reporter noted in an apparent reference to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) formal launch of an impeachment inquiry.

The play, which also focuses on former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report on Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, is titled You Can’t Make This Sh*t Up and features a celebrity cast including “Larry David … Tim Bagley, John Fugelsang, Tony Goldwyn, Ernie Hudson, Maz Jobrani, EJ Johnson, Josh Malina, Debra Messing, Stephanie Miller, Poppy Montgomery, Laraine Newman, Jonah Platt, Billy Porter, Paul Reiser and Katey Sagal.”

While David is taking on the role of the narrator, Messing will play the president, according to the report.

“When I was Senator for so many years, every single speech I gave always ended with me saying that it’s so critical you cared and you’re here. So, it’s particularly gratifying to me to see people who stand to have something to lose,” Boxer told the Hollywood Reporter.

“In the case of incredibly talented and gifted performers in this show, when they come out and say they are willing to do this, to me, it means a lot. They have more to lose from it. I am so gratified and grateful to them for wiling to make a difference,” she added.

Boxer noted that she “read every word of the Mueller report,” adding, “it’s very dry, but it shows the president attempting to obstruct justice 11 different times.”

“In this particular production, it’s so funny because Hirsch is such an incredible writer. She added a narrator [David] and there’s so much commentary from that part all the way through which will make it that much funnier,” she added.

As Breitbart News has extensively reported, the Mueller report did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Mueller did not recommend charging the president with obstruction of justice.

Hollywood’s rehash of the Mueller investigation follows the Democrat-led House effort to impeach Trump, with Pelosi caving to the far-left flank of her caucus and formally announcing an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Democrats largely cited the so-called whistleblower complaint as the leading reason to actively pursue impeachment this week. Trump authorized the release the transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which — as several Republican lawmakers pointed out — showed no “pressure,” quid pro quo, or violation of law.

Despite that, Boxer says the play’s timing “could not be more opportune.”

“If this impeachment is successful, at this point, I don’t see many badges of courage on the other side of the aisle. The only way to remove him from office is through an election, so it’s important to gather and get together,” she told the Hollywood Reporter.

“The timing of this couldn’t be any more opportune. I hope everyone buys a ticket and brings a friend and reaches out to the younger generation,” Boxer said. “We will take any donation — large or small — and use it to give free tickets to those who can’t afford to come.”"

The toy company introduced a line of 29 dolls called “Creatable World,” which comes in different kits with hair, clothing, and other accessory options depending on whether the kit is more masculine or feminine. The dolls come in at a suggested retail price of $30.

“Toys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,” Kim Culmone, senior vice president of Mattel Fashion Doll Design, said in a statement. “Through research, we heard that kids don’t want their toys dictated by gender norms.”

When the company rolled out the dolls, Mattel toned down typically masculine and feminine features and featured kits addressed with the pronoun “they” and the slogan “A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in.”

Mattel said the dolls are available at big-box retailers such as Target, Walmart, and Amazon."

On Wednesday, the maker of Barbie introduced Creatable World, “a doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in,” says a press release from Mattel.

“In our world, dolls are as limitless as the kids who play with them,” the company states, adding the new doll line will give children “the freedom to create their own customizable characters again and again.”

According to Mattel, the Creatable World dolls have wardrobe options, wigs, and various accessories that children can use to style them as they choose.

“This line allows all kids to express themselves freely which is why it resonates so strongly with them,” she said. “We’re hopeful Creatable World will encourage people to think more broadly about how all kids can benefit from doll play.”

In February, Mattel introduced dolls with braided hair texture, a different body type, and Barbie dolls that have physical disabilities.

LGBT activist group GLAAD praised the new line of dolls intended to reflect gender ideology, which asserts biological sex is subservient to gender identity.

“Mattel’s new line of gender inclusive dolls encourages children to be their authentic selves and is the latest sign that toys and media aimed at kids are expanding to reflect how diverse children and their families actually are,” said Rich Ferraro, GLAAD’s chief communications officer, reported ABC News. “So many children and parents never saw themselves represented in toys and dolls, but this new line raises the bar for inclusion thanks to input from parents, physicians and children themselves.”"

The Washington Post Magazine said Planned Parenthood has advised the entertainment industry on more than 150 productions since 2014, citing estimates provided by a director at the nonprofit.

“Nobody used to call me,” Caren Spruch, Planned Parenthood’s director of arts and entertainment engagement, told the Post. “I would be watching TV and going to the movies and figuring out who I thought might be open to including these story lines. Now I have a couple of repeat clients. Now people call me.”

The report noted that Planned Parenthood has advised productions including the 2014 romantic comedy Obvious Child, which features an abortion subplot, as well as the TV shows Shrill and Jane the Virgin.

“If there’s a word or two that isn’t entirely accurate, she [Spruch] helps me drill down on that and make sure that we’re not putting misinformation out there,” said Jennie Snyder Urman, the show runner of Jane the Virgin.

Spruch encourages screenwriters to discuss abortion or works as a script doctor for screenwriters interested incorporating abortion, birth control or sexually transmitted infections in their storylines, according to the report.

The article recounts how Spruch arrived at Planned Parenthood in 1989 as a senior field organizer. She began courting youth through tactics like handing out information at concerts by Santana and Dave Matthews Band.

At one point, she cornered Maggie Gyllenhaal after spotting the actress in the audience of a play at the Public Theater in New York.

“She’s been a hardcore activist ever since,” Spruch said in the article.

Planned Parenthood sees Hollywood as a way of spreading its message to a wide audience.

“A lot of people learn about sexual and reproductive health care through pop culture and entertainment programs,” Melanie Roussell Newman, Planned Parenthood’s senior vice president of communication and culture, told the Post.

“We’ve seen pop culture change views around LGBTQ issues, for example, and pop culture has the power to challenge abortion stigma, too.”

The Post article includes comments from pro-life activists, some of whom object to Planned Parenthood’s influence over the entertainment industry.

“It’s like the tobacco industry getting to fact-check how smoking is treated in films,” Lila Rose, founder of Live Action, told the Post.

In July, the New York Times reported that Hollywood is depicting abortions at “record levels” on TV and in film in 2019.

The younger Biden, who has a history of getting rich from entities tied to his father, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the former vice president has attempted to paint the issue as an abuse of power on Trump’s part, many have noted the unanswered questions surrounding his son’s tenure at Burisma points to serious conflict of interests, if not outright corruption.

The most prominent and perplexing question is how and why Hunter Biden was appointed to the company’s board of directors in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company’s board of directors.

At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden’s lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden’s ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father’s position as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

The poor optics not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden’s own business partners. Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma.

More troubling, however, is an episode that took place in 2016, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the country’s top prosecutor.

Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if Shokin was not fired came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor’s abilities to root out corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing. Regardless of the reason, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son’s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump’s alleged misuse of power.

The former vice president’s claim, though, directly contradicts his son’s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do,’” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

Since making his initial statement in Iowa, Joe Biden has reverted back to his long held position of refusing to discuss his son’s dealings publicly. The silence has left a lot of unanswered questions about Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.

“Again the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight. “These entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He’s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that’s what needs to be investigated.”

The question is all the more important given Hunter Biden’s history of profiting from his father’s political connections. As Breitbart News reported, the younger Biden scored a job fresh out of law school with his father’s top campaign contributor. In 1996, Hunter Biden was hired for an undisclosed position with MBNA, which at the time was one of the nation’s largest credit card companies.

The job raised eyebrows from good government groups as MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations. Hunter Biden would continue working for MBNA in one capacity or another until the mid-2000s, while his father was writing bankruptcy legislation favored by the company."

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company’s board of directors.

At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden’s lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden’s ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father’s position as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

The poor optics not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden’s own business partners. Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma.

More troubling, however, is an episode that took place in 2016, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the country’s top prosecutor.

Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if Shokin was not fired came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor’s abilities to root out corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing. Regardless of the reason, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son’s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump’s alleged misuse of power.

The former vice president’s claim, though, directly contradicts his son’s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do,’” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

Since making his initial statement in Iowa, Joe Biden has reverted back to his long held position of refusing to discuss his son’s dealings publicly. The silence has left a lot of unanswered questions about Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.

“Again the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight. “These entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He’s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that’s what needs to be investigated.”

The question is all the more important given Hunter Biden’s history of profiting from his father’s political connections. As Breitbart News reported, the younger Biden scored a job fresh out of law school with his father’s top campaign contributor. In 1996, Hunter Biden was hired for an undisclosed position with MBNA, which at the time was one of the nation’s largest credit card companies.

The job raised eyebrows from good government groups as MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations. Hunter Biden would continue working for MBNA in one capacity or another until the mid-2000s, while his father was writing bankruptcy legislation favored by the company."

“The Democrats, they went down to see the president of Ukraine and they asked him for all sorts of things,” Trump said, noting that Democrats urged Ukrainians not to cooperate with Republicans and remain aligned with the Democrats as if it was a “political war.”

U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to the Ukrainian government in May 2018, urging them to cooperate with investigators in the Russia investigation and the investigation of President Donald Trump.

“They shouldn’t have done that,” Trump said. “That should be an impeachable event … tremendous pressure on Ukraine.”

Trump noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement saying that the president put no pressure on him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption.

He again argued that he halted foreign aid to Ukraine to see if other countries would help Ukraine with defense aid, and condemned the Democrat’s impeachment process as the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.”

After releasing a transcript of the call, Trump said that the conversation was proven “friendly.”

“There was no pressure. The way you had that built up, that call, it was going to be the call from hell,” he said. “It turned out to be a nothing call.”

The call transcript confirmed that Trump asked Zelensky about a possible investigation into Biden and his son for their actions in Ukraine.

Trump accused the establishment media for fueling the ongoing controversy over his phone call after a whistleblower raised concerns about the content of the call based on second-hand information.

“So, part of the problem you have is you have the fake news,” he said. “You have a lot of corrupt reporting, there’s some very fine reporters and journalists, but you have a lot of corrupt reporters, a lot of corrupt journalists.”"

“It is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath,” Biden said in a lengthy statement following the White House’s release of the July 25th conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“The 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it,” he continued.

According to the transcript, President Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden’s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, an energy firm where his son Hunter was a board member. The former vice president bragged about the prosecutor’s ouster before the Council of Foreign Relations last year, saying that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the investigator was removed.

Numerous congressional Democrats expressed support for impeachment after the call between President Trump and Zelensky came to light, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to formally launch an impeachment inquiry.

Though Biden did not mention impeachment in his statement, the presidential candidate said he supports Democrats’ efforts to help the president “accountable.”

“Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,” he said. “In the meantime, I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America’s families.”

During a joint press conference at the United Nations Wednesday, Zelensky denied that President Trump pressed him to probe Hunter Biden.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” he said.

When it was President Trump’s time to speak, he maintained that he applied “no pressure whatsoever” on Ukraine.

“Part of the problem you have is you have the fake news, you have a lot of corrupt reporting,” Trump added, once again denouncing the Ukraine call as “the single greatest witch hunt in American history.”"

Joshua Johnson, host of 1A, discussed the White House’s release of the transcript of a July conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, following Democrats’ decision to move ahead with an impeachment inquiry against Trump on Tuesday. He was joined by Financial Times journalist Edward Luce and by Southern Methodist University presidential historian Jeff Engel.

At one point, Johnson asked whether there was merit to Democrats’ suspicion that Trump supporters would not care about the evidence:

I don’t think that it is inaccurate to say that some Democrats would rather focus on 2020 because they believe that the president’s base is unshakeable, that they will support him no matter what, and that whatever comes out of this impeachment inquiry, that they are solidly set on re-electing Donald Trump. I also don’t think that hyperbole would be overstating it to say that some Democrats just think that the president’s base is too dumb to know the difference, that they wouldn’t get — even if all of the evidence pointed toward impeachment, pointed toward this being someone who needed to be removed, that the president has fooled enough people, that they are so gullible, that they will not vote against him no matter what. That’s the vibe I get from some Democrats — that this whole thing is a waste of time, because “those people” are going to pick him no matter what.

Luce replied: “There’s a pretty good case to be made for that argument … There is a bedrock of support that, as Trump said, he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, they’d still vote for him.” He added: “Whether that means they’re gullible or not, I don’t know.”

Engel said that Trump’s supporters might not believe evidence against the president that otherwise seemed plain because people were less trusting of news. “We are living in a much different truth environment” than during the era of President Richard M. Nixon, who resigned before he could be impeached during the Watergate scandal, he said.

He explained that people might not believe evidence against Trump even if they saw or heard it themselves because they were less trusting of news and because video or audio evidence will be more manipulable in the near future.

Pelosi noted that the House passed universal background checks over 200 days ago, then said, “Every day since then, on average, 100 people are killed by gun violence, 47 of them children or teenagers.”

She is getting her figure of 100 firearm-related deaths from 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers. Those showed 39,773 deaths, which CNN reported as the highest level of firearm-related deaths in 40 years.

Pelosi seized on that high level and now claims “100 people killed by gun violence,” on average, each day.

However, the truth is that 66 percent of those who die in a firearm-related death do so via suicide, not “gun violence.” Actually gun violence deaths normally range somewhere between 11,000 and 11,500 or 11,000 and 12,000 a year.

We saw this same tactic used when Hillary Clinton was running for president. She claimed “90 people a day die from gun violence” when, in reality, 66 percent of deaths were suicides.

And while the left tends to push more gun control as a way to reduce suicides, the Chicago Tribune‘s Steve Chapman notes that suicides in stringently gun-controlled Japan are far higher than those in gun-friendly U.S.A. Because of this, Chapman contends that more gun control is not the solution.

But, you would have a hard time convincing this police horse that hooliganism has disappeared.

Things got ugly in the streets after a game between Portsmouth and Southampton on Tuesday. It’s unclear what started the fracas, but what is clear to see on the viral video is a fan punching a police horse.

“Yo yo yo! My man’s swinging for a horse!” the fan can be heard screaming in the video.

Watch:

Unfortunately for his assailant, the horse had a remarkable jaw and took the punch quite well. In fact, he barely looked fazed as he quickly recovered and chased the man down the street before his two-legged colleagues arrived and exacted revenge.

Yahoo! reported that a 52-year-old man had been arrested on charges of animal cruelty.

Though, it appears more damage was done to the horse puncher, as opposed to the horse. Moral of the story: Don’t punch horses people, especially police horses.

Southampton won the game, 4-0.

The meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz has concluded. In a short time, the responsibility for forming the government will be given to Benjamin Netanyahu, after which President Rivlin and Prime Minister Netanyahu will give remarks. — Reuven Rivlin (@PresidentRuvi) September 25, 2019

The center-left Blue and White party of Benny Gantz won 33 seats to the conservative Likud’s 32 seats in the elections last week — the country’s second last year after the small, secular nationalist Yisraeli Beiteinu party of Avigdor Lieberman refused to serve in Netanyahu’s coalition with religious parties. The election produced a stalemate in which neither the left-wing bloc around Blue and White (54 seats) nor the right-wing bloc around Likud (55 seats) had enough seats to form a governing majority in Israel’s 120-seat Knesset. Lieberman held the balance and insisted on a unity government that included both of the two major parties. Netanyahu agreed, and offered Gantz a power-sharing deal. He reiterated that offer today upon being tasked with forming a government.

But Gantz refused to serve under Netanyahu in any capacity — even temporarily as part of a rotating prime ministership — because Netanyahu is facing indictment for charges that critics say are partisan and meritless.

Gantz’s refusal may also be strategic. Knowing that Netanyahu will struggle to build a coalition with Lieberman, and that the other, smaller parties (left-wing parties and Arab parties) are likely to refuse to govern with him, the possibility exists that Netanyahu will fail to form a coalition by the 28-day deadline (with a two-week extension).

In that case, Gantz himself might have a chance to form a government — or the country would go to elections for a third time this year, an unprecedented situation that Rivlin has urged all parties to work together to avoid.

It is also possible that Gantz has miscalculated by rejecting unity, denying his voters a chance to be represented in the next government, and giving Netanyahu a chance to save both his government and his career by trying again.

Trump accused China of severe intellectual property theft and global fraud in continuing to declare itself a “developing nation” despite being the world’s second-largest economy. He also offered a message of hope to the pro-democracy protesters challenging Beijing in Hong Kong, pressing the Communist Party to stop attempting to override the legal agreement that keeps Hong Kong capitalist.

“Trump’s ‘America First’ speech was widely deemed as a nationalist speech with low-energy delivery,” the People’s Daily claimed. “His speech is another example of Trump ‘gaming’ the facts to fit his narrative about the rise of China.”

The newspaper accused Trump of ignoring how communism is “making China great again” and of incorrectly blaming China for mass deindustrialization in the United States, which it instead claimed was the result of “rational economic behavior … largely driven by market forces.”

“China’s achievements derive from the hard work of the Chinese people and the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, and sweat and even tears are behind China’s rise to greatness,” the People’s Daily declared.

Blaming China’s distortion of its economic reality to benefit from globalization at the expense of the United States, the People’s Daily argued, was “a stretch of the imagination.”

“A lie told a thousand times does not become truth. The model that China has embraced values globalization, reform, and opening to the world,” the propaganda outlet asserted. “China plays by the rules of the WTO and other international multilateral organizations, which were mostly designed by the West.”

“We should understand that China and the United States are different. They have different histories, different cultures, different political systems, and different development path,” the newspaper insisted. “The key to harmony is how to correctly understand and handle them.”

The People’s Daily recommended that “if Trump is serious about fixing America,” he should stop “bullying” China by pointing out its outrageous intellectual property theft and unethical economic policies.

In his speech before fellow world leaders in New York on Tuesday, Trump noted that “the most important difference” between his administration’s policies and those of his predecessors is his realistic approach to China. The entry of China into the World Trade Organization as a developing country, he noted, was a move intended to “compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us, and for private property and for the rule of law.”

The theory that including China in global trade as a communist nation would liberalize it “has been tested and proven completely wrong,” Trump asserted.

“Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,” the president said.

Trump went on to warn China to “honor its binding treaty” with Hong Kong and protect its “freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life.” The Chinese government, through its proxies running Hong Kong, have actively attempted to crush those institutions – first through the attempted imposition of a law allowing the communists to extradite political dissidents, and later with police brutality against those who dared protest the law. Trump once again reminded the world that the violence against protesters was on the back of Communist Party dictator Xi Jinping – who has refused to publicly remark on the matter – urging him to act as a “great leader” and not violate the rights of the protesters.

In addition to the outrage from the People’s Daily, the Chinese regime formally disparaged Trump’s remarks as “false” through its foreign ministry. Spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed the veracity of Trump’s speech and added, “The U.S. should look at China’s development with an open, inclusive and win-win mentality and meet China halfway.” He also directed reporters to remarks by Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also in New York to address the General Assembly.

“Seeking hegemony has never been in the Chinese DNA. China has no intention of playing a ‘game of thrones’ on the world stage,” Wang said on Tuesday.

“On the claim that US policy has failed to change China and that it’s time to revert to a containment policy, Wang said that the idea of molding others according to one’s wish is wrong and will never work. Seventy years on, it is important for the US to avoid picking another wrong fight with the wrong country,” the Global Times, another government propaganda outlet, quoted Wang as saying.

General Assembly speech Wednesday, accusing neighboring dictator Nicolás Maduro of aiding drug traffickers, terrorists, “murderers, and child rapists.”

Duque compared Maduro to genocidal Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and announced he would hand over a dossier of evidence to the head of the General Assembly proving that Maduro is harboring Marxist terrorists belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) that are engaged in an ongoing war against the Colombian government.

Entregamos a #ONU pruebas de complicidad de Nicolás Maduro con terroristas que atentan contra pueblo colombiano. Presentamos a cerca de 20 criminales que traicionaron generosidad de Colombia y están en Venezuela. También ubicación de 1.400 hombres de Eln, campamentos y pistas. pic.twitter.com/PPN388Ksm1 — Iván Duque (@IvanDuque) September 25, 2019

Duque acknowledged that some members of the FARC have laid down their weapons as part of a 2016 peace deal that preceded Duque, and granted the terrorist group multiple uncontested seats in the Colombian Congress. Given the existence of the deal, he noted, “these groups have not enjoyed the fruits of reintegration or disarmament simply because they chose not to.”

“A group of narco-terrorists sought to intimidate Colombia hiding behind claims of ideological goals, but the reality is that these groups have not enjoyed the fruits of reintegration or disarmament because they simply chose not to,” Duque told the General Assembly. “They have not left behind their life of crime, they have lied to Colombia and Colombians, and they have aligned themselves with a dictatorship that is repressing its people in Venezuela.”

The terrorists have “found themselves resisted by a people that will not be cowered …. let there be no room for doubt, I will use all tools available to me so that Colombia enjoys peace,” Duque warned the terrorists.

Duque appeared to be addressing two main FARC terror leaders directly, “Jesús Santrich” and “Iván Márquez,” who the Colombian government gave Senate seats to before they defected to Venezuela and announced a new civil war against Bogotá. Maduro and his cronies have insisted they have “nothing to do” with the FARC war, but Duque insisted otherwise on Wednesday.

“The Venezuelan dictatorship is one more link in the chain of transnational terrorism. Its corrupt structures are the handmaidens of drug cartels,” Duque affirmed. “Its followers are adherents of a mafia and fuel the violence in Colombia. The dictatorship gives refuge to murderers and child rapists – and those who ignore these facts are, by their silence, accomplices of the dictatorship.”

The FARC is over a century old and has for nearly just as much time been guilty of abducting children to use as soldiers. Girls forced into terrorism often fall prey to rapist terrorists, and are later forced into unwanted abortions to keep from slowing down terror cells with babies. One FARC abortionist arrested was believed to be responsible for as many as 500 murders of unborn children.

“My government has credible and resounding proof that corroborates the support lent by the Venezuelan dictatorship to criminal and drug trafficking groups that are operating in Venezuela and assume activities in Colombia as a assault on our nationhood,” Duque said, displaying a thick dossier that he promised to hand over to the president of the General Assembly.

Duque also addressed the damage that Maduro has done to his own country, not just Colombia.

“Since 2015, at least 4.2 million people have fled Venezuela. They flee from a nation that was wealthy and is now in the abyss, that cannot feed its people,” the Colombian president said. “That was a flourishing democracy and is now an authoritarian regime that is now without a free media … its citizens have no choice but to jump ship.”

Duque affirmed that Colombia does not recognize Maduro’s legitimacy, but that of constitutionally appointed interim President Juan Guaidó, along with over 50 other nations, most in Latin America.

“We adopt this stance driven by the need we see for the Venezuelan people to have their democracy restored,” Duque said. “The Venezuelan tragedy has a name and we all know what that name is.”

Duque said that Maduro’s human rights abuses “can be justifiably compared to the crimes of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia,” who was tried before an international tribunal for genocide following a vicious campaign to eradicate non-Serbian people from Bosnia.

“We cannot sit by idly watching,” Duque urged. “Venezuela needs the urgent convening of genuinely free and fair elections and it needs the full restoration of the rule of law.”

General Assembly against the United States and its allies, with a constant drumbeat of threats that regional “peace” and “stability” can only be achieved by meeting Iranian demands.

Some of these threats were directed at the European Union, which has not provided Iran with the benefits it expected in exchange for remaining in the nuclear deal.

Rouhani complained about “terrorist strikes and bombardments in Yemen, Syria, occupied Palestine, Afghanistan, and other countries of the world, including Iraq.”

In other words, Rouhani was accusing the United States and its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, of terrorism in an effort to deflect allegations of Iranian military aggression and support for terrorism. Later he called the United States a “warmonger” that should be punished for “leveling allegations and grudges” against “innocent” nations such as Iran and accused the U.S. of supporting ISIS and other terrorist organizations.

Rouhani said the Middle East is “burning in the flames of war, bloodshed, aggression, occupation, and religious and sectarian fanaticism and extremism,” with the “suppressed people of Palestine” as the “biggest victims.”

“Discrimination, appropriation of lands, settlement expansions, and killings continue to be practiced against the Palestinians,” he charged, predicting that “U.S. and Zionist plans” for the Palestinian territories are “certainly doomed.”

Rouhani claimed Iran’s “regional and international assistance and cooperation on security and counterterrorism,” exemplified by Iran’s alliance with Russia and Turkey in Syria, have been “decisive” against the “destructive plans” of the United States.

“I hail from a country that has resisted the most merciless economic terrorism and has defended its rights to independence and science and technology development,” the Iranian president said.

“The U.S. government, while imposing extraterritorial sanctions and threats against other nations, has made a lot of efforts to deprive Iran of the advantages of participating in the global economy, and has resorted to international piracy by misusing the international banking system,” he alleged.

“We Iranians have been the pioneers of freedom-seeking movements in the region, while seeking peace and progress for our nation as well as our neighbors,” Rouhani claimed.

“We have never surrendered to foreign aggression and imposition. We cannot believe the invitation to negotiation of people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions in history against the dignity and prosperity of our nation,” he said, restating several times that his regime does not view the current U.S. government as a trustworthy negotiating partner.

Rouhani accused “criminal” U.S. officials of pursuing sanctions in an “addictive manner” against a range of ostensibly innocent countries such as Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, China, and Russia.

He said the sanctions are harming “83 million Iranians, particularly women and children,” although later he also claimed that the sanctions have had little negative effect on Iran’s economic and social development.

“The attitude of the incumbent U.S. government towards the nuclear deal, or JCPOA, not only violates the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, but also constitutes a breach of the sovereignty and political and economic independence of all of the world’s countries,” he argued.

“In spite of the American withdrawal from the JCPOA, for one year Iran remained fully faithful to all of its nuclear commitments in accordance with the JCPOA. Out of respect for the Security Council resolution, we provided Europe with the opportunity to fulfill its 11 commitments, made to compensate for the U.S. withdrawal. However, unfortunately, we only heard beautiful words while witnessing no effective measures,” he said.

Rouhani threatened Europe by saying Iran’s “patience has a limit” and it has almost been reached with respect to Europe’s “inability” to give Tehran what it wants. He implied that Iran’s national “dignity” would therefore compel it to begin violating the JCPOA in increasingly broad ways.

“On behalf of my nation and state, I would like to announce that our response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative,” he said.

“The government and people of Iran have remained steadfast against the harshest sanctions in the past one and a half years, and will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty, pressure, and sanctions,” he declared.

“The only way for talks to begin is to return to commitments and compliance. If you are sensitive to the name of ‘JCPOA,’ well then, you can return to its framework and abide by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations,” he said.

Rouhani suggested Iran might be willing to “give more” if the Western world agrees to “pay more” in a revised nuclear deal, although he did not detail either his offers or demands.

Rouhani claimed Iran is interested in maintaining “the peace and stability of the Persian Gulf, and providing freedom of navigation and safety of movement in the Strait of Hormuz.”

He lamented that “recent incidents have endangered such security” and suggested the “umbrella” of safe passage could only be restored if all regional countries joined a “Coalition of Hope” that would respect Iran’s needs as well. This coalition would pointedly exclude all powers outside the Middle East and would obstruct the deployment of foreign naval vessels to secure the freedom of navigation.

“The security of our region shall be provided when American troops pull out. Security shall not be supplied with American weapons and intervention,” Rouhani said explicitly.

“The United States, after 18 years, has failed to reduce acts of terrorism. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran managed to terminate the scourge of Daesh with the assistance of neighboring nations and governments,” he claimed, using another name for the Islamic State (and grievously insulting the U.S.-supported Kurdish forces who did much of the fighting against ISIS).

“The ultimate way towards peace and security in the Middle East passes through inward democracy and outward diplomacy,” he said. “Security cannot be purchased or supplied by foreign governments … America is not our neighbor.”

“The security of Saudi Arabia shall be guaranteed with the termination of aggression towards Yemen,” Rouhani said, effectively telling the Saudis they can halt Iranian attacks on their oil fields by surrendering control of Yemen to Iranian proxies."

The socialist strongman, who took power in 2006 and remains one of the region’s longest-lasting left-wing governments, argued that the world’s financial system “remains undemocratic, unequal, and unstable, all while supporting tax havens and banking cartels that force smaller countries to accept punitive measures to maintain their existence.”

“It fills us with sadness that these social inequalities still exist,” he said. “According to data from Oxfam, 1.3 billion people live in poverty, while one percent of the richest hold 82 percent of the world’s wealth.”

Morales went on to blame the capitalist system on the “global oligarchy,” in which a “handful of millionaires are defining the economic and political destiny of humanity.”

“That 26 people have the same wealth as 3.8 billion people is unfair, immoral, and unacceptable,” he declared. “The core issue lies within the model of production and consumerism, the private ownership of natural resources and in the unequal distribution of wealth. I say this with absolute clarity: the core of the issue is capitalism.”

Morales also addressed ongoing concerns over the Amazon rainforest, with both he and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro facing intense scrutiny for their responses to a spate of recent wildfires.

“Our house, mother Earth, is our only home, and it is irreplaceable,” he said. “In recent weeks we have seen focal points for heat [in the Amazon rainforest] … We are fighting these fires using our financial resources. To date, our country has spent over 15 million dollars in order to put out the fires.”

The 59-year-old strongman, who rose to power with the support of many of Bolivia’s indigenous peoples, has in recent years taken various steps to consolidate his power and turn the country into a socialist state.

Some of his measures include the scrapping of term limits, reforms to the judicial system, the imprisonment of political opponents, and the realignment of the country’s foreign policy towards closer relationships with Latin American leftist regimes such as Cuba and Venezuela, as well as authoritarian regimes further afield such as Iran, China, and Syria.

“The administration of President Evo Morales has created a hostile environment for human rights defenders that undermines their ability to work independently,” notes the human rights campaign group Human Rights Watch. “A judicial reform that began in 2016 risks seriously weakening the rule of law in the country.”

The socialist strongman, who took power in 2006 and remains one of the region’s longest-lasting left-wing governments, argued that the world’s financial system “remains undemocratic, unequal, and unstable, all while supporting tax havens and banking cartels that force smaller countries to accept punitive measures to maintain their existence.”

“It fills us with sadness that these social inequalities still exist,” he said. “According to data from Oxfam, 1.3 billion people live in poverty, while one percent of the richest hold 82 percent of the world’s wealth.”

Morales went on to blame the capitalist system on the “global oligarchy,” in which a “handful of millionaires are defining the economic and political destiny of humanity.”

“That 26 people have the same wealth as 3.8 billion people is unfair, immoral, and unacceptable,” he declared. “The core issue lies within the model of production and consumerism, the private ownership of natural resources and in the unequal distribution of wealth. I say this with absolute clarity: the core of the issue is capitalism.”

Morales also addressed ongoing concerns over the Amazon rainforest, with both he and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro facing intense scrutiny for their responses to a spate of recent wildfires.

“Our house, mother Earth, is our only home, and it is irreplaceable,” he said. “In recent weeks we have seen focal points for heat [in the Amazon rainforest] … We are fighting these fires using our financial resources. To date, our country has spent over 15 million dollars in order to put out the fires.”

The 59-year-old strongman, who rose to power with the support of many of Bolivia’s indigenous peoples, has in recent years taken various steps to consolidate his power and turn the country into a socialist state.

Some of his measures include the scrapping of term limits, reforms to the judicial system, the imprisonment of political opponents, and the realignment of the country’s foreign policy towards closer relationships with Latin American leftist regimes such as Cuba and Venezuela, as well as authoritarian regimes further afield such as Iran, China, and Syria.

“The administration of President Evo Morales has created a hostile environment for human rights defenders that undermines their ability to work independently,” notes the human rights campaign group Human Rights Watch. “A judicial reform that began in 2016 risks seriously weakening the rule of law in the country.”

“Extensive and arbitrary use of pretrial detention—and long trial delays—undermine defendants’ rights and contribute to prison overcrowding,” adds the organization. “Impunity for past human rights abuses, violence against women, and child labor are other major concerns.”

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that Democrats’ decision to launch an official impeachment inquiry is proof they have “lost their minds” and expects the decision “will backfire on them in 2020” in key elections.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” McCarthy said in an emailed statement provided exclusively to Breitbart News on Wednesday afternoon. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”

McCarthy added that he sees no other outcome here other than the Democrats paying a serious political price for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to cave in to the far left of her conference and move forward on impeachment despite not having a clear reason to do so.

“America is too great to be led by a vision so small — I’m 100 percent confident Democrats obsession with impeachment will backfire on them in 2020,” McCarthy said.

McCarthy’s statement comes after Pelosi announced Tuesday that Democrats are now officially moving forward with an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a decision she made before seeing the transcript of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump was alleged by a supposed “whistleblower” in the intelligence community to have engaged in a quid pro quo where he threatened to withhold U.S. taxpayer aid to Ukraine in exchange for forcing Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, the one-time now-former Democrat 2020 presidential front runner.

But Trump on Wednesday released the transcript of the phone call with Zelensky, which shows there was no such quid pro quo. The transcript shows Trump did broach the subject of Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and the former Vice President’s efforts while in office to pressure the Ukrainian government to terminate a government prosecutor investigating his son’s company. But in the transcript, the new Ukrainian president Zelensky agrees with Trump and says he is planning to investigate the Biden scandal.

Unlike Pelosi’s move to announce an impeachment push without seeing any evidence, McCarthy’s statement to Breitbart News was issued after the transcript was released publicly. It confirms previous Breitbart News reporting that Democrats are reeling and disjointed, rudderless without a clear and concise message, while Republicans are preparing for the upcoming 2020 elections in which the GOP is now clearly emboldened after the Democrats made the remarkable move to proceed with impeachment.

Privately, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed concerns about the lack of a focus on the impeachment move; without a clear outcome in mind, Democrats fear that whatever happens will further energize Trump ahead of the 2020 election while failing to remove him.

“If you’re going to take a shot at the king, you best not miss,” one House Democrat leadership aide told Breitbart News. “And we do not have a pathway to win without 20 GOP votes in the Senate. We are nowhere near that, not even close.”

Another senior Democrat congressional aide added regarding the move to attempt to impeach Trump: “It’s a joke. It’s all bullshit.”

Over on the Senate side, most Republicans are in line with Trump. While Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said that he considers the transcript’s contents “troubling,” he declined to discuss “impeachment” at this time.

“The Democrats are fucked,” a senior Senate GOP aide told Breitbart News upon reviewing the transcript. “This is going to unite everyone except maybe Mitt, I bet even Ben Sasse comes around on this and backs the president unless there’s some bombshell with the whistleblower who didn’t even hear this call. Republican operatives I’ve talked to are giddy about this.”

Republican senators were publicly backing Trump by lunchtime on Wednesday:

Grassley: “no quid pro quo you have to have that to have done anything wrong” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

GOP Sen. Capito in Trump transcript: “I don’t think it rises to the level of an impeachable offense at all. I was expecting much more from the pre-reports. It sounded like the president” “Much, much, much less hysterical than what we were led to believe” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

Tillis: “Nancy Pelosi should be embarrassed. The transcript debunks the Democrats’ false claims against President Trump and demonstrates that their call to impeach him is a total farce.” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

Even Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) would not use the word “impeachment” when talking about the Democrat Party’s decision to try to take out the president of the United States.

Manchin statement on impeachment doesn’t mention impeachment “Any allegation of misconduct with a foreign country must be investigated. I firmly believe it is premature to jump to any conclusion until an investigation of the facts is complete.” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 25, 2019

The Senate GOP aide pointed to “deafening silence” from red state Democrat state parties, looking throughout the south and heartland noting that Democrat party officials outside D.C. are not standing with their party’s leadership in Washington now. The aide also noted that Pelosi has gotten desperate.

“She threw a Hail Mary without waiting to see the transcript,” the Senate GOP aide said. “They should have held off a few days.”

Looking across the country, Republicans nationwide are energized in candidate recruitment in battleground districts where they are seeking credible challengers to vulnerable Democrats. While some potential GOP candidates were watching and waiting on the sidelines, not sure if they would run for Congress now or wait until a future election when they think their chances might be better, at least two executive directors from state GOP committees in two 2020 battleground states with vulnerable House Democrats up for re-election have told Breitbart News in the last 24 hours there has been a surge of interest from potential credible candidates seeking to oust the Democrats from the House majority.

What’s more, candidates in battleground districts across America who are already running are emboldened. Teddy Daniels, a Republican and wounded warrior veteran running against Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA)–who just backed impeachment this week–in the deeply pro-Trump eighth district in Pennsylvania, ripped Cartwright for caving to the left while not solving problems for the constituents in his district.

“Radical leftist Matt Cartwright and the Democrats want to overturn the will of the American people who legitimately elected President Trump in 2016,” Daniels told Breitbart News in an email. “They want to use witch hunts and the impeachment process to bring about their wild and crazy socialist, anti-2nd Amendment and open borders agenda that nobody wants.”

National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Michael McAdams piled on Cartwright too.

“In a district President Trump won by ten points, Matt Cartwright has decided to stand with the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the socialist Democrats rather than Pennsylvania voters,” McAdams said.

Pennsylvania’s 8th congressional district is one of the 13 districts a Democrat currently represents where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 6 percent–Trump won by 10 points there–in 2016. There are another 18 districts, for 31 total pro-Trump districts currently represented by Democrats, where Trump beat Clinton in the last election.

To retake the majority in 2020, Republicans only need to win back a net gain of 19 seats next year–and now that the Democrats have abandoned the possibility of passing any legislation whatsoever on things like infrastructure, prescription drug pricing, healthcare, the economy, jobs, guns, in favor of impeachment, Republicans feel like the Democrats have given them a messaging gift going into 2020.

McCarthy, for an hour-long exclusive interview that aired on Breitbart News radio in early August, laid out the GOP plan to retake the House majority with these 31 districts at the forefront of the effort.

“There are 31 seats that Democrats sit in today that President Trump carried,” McCarthy said. “Of those 31, 13 of them President Trump carried by more than six points. So, here you have the socialist wing of the party trying to take them further left, when the only way they have the majority is actually winning in Republican areas—areas that would be swing districts.”

Republicans were confident then, going into the August recess. But these efforts, thanks to the Democrats’ decision in the words of one GOP aide to “jump the shark completely now” with moving on impeachment proceedings, have now been supercharged this week.

In another of those 13 super pro-Trump districts that the president won by more than 6 percent, New Mexico’s second district, incumbent freshman Democrat Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-NM) struggled in a statement to defend her party’s move forward with an effort to impeach President Trump. In fact, the statement does not even use the word “impeachment,” even though she is now personally implicated as a Democrat member of the House majority in the effort to impeach Trump.

“Congress has a legal right to see the full details of any whistleblower complaint, especially those that involve our nation’s security,” Torres Small said. “The President must release the full complaint and allow any testimony by the whistleblower, or any other administration officials, to occur free of White House interference. Through the coming weeks and months, I will act to support and defend our Constitution by insisting on a transparent process that fully informs the American people and restores trust and faith in our system. Any threat to our national security must be taken seriously.”

In response, her Republican challengers lit into her. Yvette Herrell, the GOP candidate from the 2018 race who nearly defeated Torres Small and was leading the Democrat on election night but votes added in later swung the race the other way, told Breitbart News that Torres Small is part of a Pelosi-led coup attempt against Trump.

“Nancy Pelosi and her radical socialist allies know they can’t beat President Trump at the ballot box, so now they are trying to impeach him over a phone call they didn’t hear and haven’t seen the transcript of,” Herrell said. “I will continue to stand in strong support of our President as I have always done, and I know that everyday hardworking New Mexicans will see through this stunt for the political charade it is.”

Claire Chase, an oil and gas executive who has come under fire for previous social media posts criticizing Trump from 2015 and 2016 who now claims to support Trump, also ripped Torres Small and defended Trump on Twitter.

Even Charlie Cook, the editor of the nonpartisan rating service the Cook Political Report, tweeted out on Wednesday how bad this looks for Democrats and how it will not move voters their way:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters. — Charlie Cook (@CharlieCookDC) September 25, 2019

If Republicans start banking races like these this early ahead of 2020, and putting these Democrats so far on the defensive that they need to surrender some seats in their majority, the GOP could theoretically–if it has enough quality candidates in place and structural resources built out across America–run the tables on the Democrats next year. There is a lot of time between now and then, but Democrats are clearly worried about what is happening–concerned it will backfire on them, as McCarthy is saying it will.

Democrat National Committee member from California Bob Mulholland told Politico about the impeachment push from his party’s leader from his own state: “Absent Trump being caught in a trunk with a young boy, impeachment is a political disaster for us Democrats.”"

Levin described disdain for America’s founding among Democrats and the broader left.

“The people who believe the country began in 1619 with slavery, who accuse the Founders of being white supremacists and trash the Constitution as nothing more than a document to protect white slave owners keep waving around the Constitution as they advance their Marxist agenda,” began Levin.

Levin continued, “Nancy Pelosi is undermining the Constitution as she claims to be promoting it and cites Benjamin Franklin at the end of the Constitutional Convention. The way this is supposed to work, impeachment is considered an extremely grave act. That’s the way the Framers debated it. It was the second-most debated subject at the Constitutional Convention after the nature of the presidency.”

Levin went on, “[The Framers] rejected things like maladministration as a basis for impeachment. They rejected the idea that pure politics should be the basis for impeachment, so they put specific language in the Constitution about high crimes and misdemeanors and a specific process: a majority vote by the House, a supermajority vote after a trial in the Senate overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.”

“This is not intended to be some kind of political act,” continued Levin. ” I hear these so-called experts on TV saying impeachment is whatever the House says it is, citing Gerald Ford. That’s not what the history of our Impeachment Clause is. [The Framers] looked very deeply at British common law, what the Parliament had done with respect to the monarch; they rejected all sorts of proposals, and this is a very high bar. It’s not just, ‘Well, we don’t like a president’ or ‘We think he did this, that, and the other thing.'”

Levin described how the Framers feared a usurpation of the president’s accountability to the public via impeachment from the House, establishing a secondary constitutional check on the process within the Senate.

“The Senate is in place under the impeachment process to keep a check on the House because they were concerned — if you look at Federalist 65 — there was some concern that the House would have too much power,” Levin stated. “The great fear was that a president wouldn’t be accountable to the public, but he’d be accountable to the House of Representatives, and that’s why they set up this elaborate process.”

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is using the impeachment process to protect her political position — and that of her House Democrat favorites — from left-wing challengers, estimated Levin.

“So what did Nancy Pelosi do yesterday?” asked Levin. “Nothing. She’s got six of her politburo chairman-types that she handpicks, who have the same ideology out of these deep blue metropolitan areas that are not representative of the diversity of this nation out of mostly New York and Los Angeles, who do what? Who are going to continue to conduct themselves as she announces a formal impeachment inquiry.”

Levin went on, “[Nancy Pelosi] doesn’t have a vote of the full House of Representatives, which is the traditional process that we have in this country. Why? Because if you’re going to go down this road, you need the body politic. You need the so-called representatives of the people engaged in this. She, like a dictator, issues a fiat to her six handpicked chairmen to conduct a formal impeachment inquiry.”

Levin said, “So, in other words, a tiny percentage of the House of Representatives — a tiny percentage of the population of the United States — is going to drag this entire nation through their left-wing hell because this is something they’ve been dreaming to do from the moment this president was elected, and she’s going to protect her so-called moderates, of which there are really only a handful, because she wants to cling to power, so there won’t be a roll call vote on the floor of the House of Representatives? The fact is nothing has changed, other than her putting a different label on what she’s doing, and, of course, the media love it.”

Pelosi fears internal Democrat challenges from the left, assessed Levin.

“I think that Nancy Pelosi — despite all the propaganda on her behalf as the first woman speaker — is weak,” Levin remarked. “She buckled. She’s befuddled. She’s got a radical Marxist wing in her party and a radical antisemitic wing in her party. She’s got [Jerry Nadler], who is being challenged in his Democrat primary by somebody, believe it or not, who is to the left of him, and they’re doing this throughout her leadership.”

“[Nancy Pelosi] already lost one of her big guys to AOC,” recalled Levin. “So they’re scared, and they want to cling to power, and this is the best she can figure out how to do it, but she’s dragging the nation through her hell. The media love this.”

Levin praised Breitbart News. “Let me say this. You guys do tremendous work. Tremendous work. I couldn’t be prouder of what you guys are doing. You came under attack, vicious attack. It’s just amazing. You guys are accused of being alt-right. You’re the biggest supporters of state of Israel anywhere that I can see. You’re being attacked for your [so-called] extremist views. You’re constitutionalists. You support what this country is doing. This is what they do. They try to destroy, smear, character-assassinate anybody who dares to stand up for liberty in this country, so keep it up.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) will not respond to his invitations for discussion, Levin shared.

“As far as AOC is concerned, she’s a reprobate,” Levin stated.”If she wants to run the country, then run for president. Other than that, she’s nothing more than a media creation. They celebrate her. I’ve invited her on every one of my platforms. Whether it’s TV, whether it’s digital TV, whether it’s radio, and we get crickets. She is a coward, and she is a dunce.”

Senate Republicans refuse to investigate possible corruption on the part of Joe Biden and other Democrats, noted Levin.

“They’re doing nothing,” said Levin of Republican senators. “How is it that the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is supposedly run by this guy Richard Burr — who’s in the Witness Protection Program — how is it that they can’t hold a hearing on Hunter and Joe Biden? Where are their subpoenas?”

Levin asked, “Our good friend Lindsey Graham, where is he? He runs the Senate Judiciary Committee. I hear all the talk. How about a little bit of action? What are they doing on the Foreign Affairs Committee? How is it that they’re not issuing subpoenas? How is it that they’re not demanding public testimony? You know, we do control the Senate, and it is appalling to me what’s taking place here.”

“The Biden family is corrupt,” determined Levin. “Joe came into office — 36 years in the Senate followed by eight years as vice president. He’s a multimillionaire. His son is a multimillionaire. His brother is a multimillionaire. They have an IQ of negative 19, combined. How the hell did this happen? We’d like to know.”

“It’s an attack on us,” concluded Levin of Democrats’ pursuing impeachment of Trump. “It’s an attack on our constitutional system, and I would argue that what these people are doing is absolutely un-American, period.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Tuesday announced that the House was launching an “official impeachment inquiry” into President Trump after reports suggested he pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine, in exchange for military aid.

The Mad Libs game mocked Democrats for trying to impeach Trump for a “made-up crime” because “the Democrat Majority in the House of Representatives still refuses to accept the results of the 2016 election” and because previous impeachment attempts through “sham hearing,” “dud report,” and “political stunt” failed.

A slew of Democrats signed on to support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry after reports alleged that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine in exchange for help investigating Joe Biden’s son, who sat on a board of a Ukrainian company that was under investigation by Ukraine’s then-top prosecutor, during a phone call with the Ukrainian president.

The Atlanta Fed’s Business Expectations survey showed expectations for growth in capital spending rising for the third consecutive month. The gauge is at the highest level recorded in the five-year life of the survey.

The composite index for business expectations declined, largely due to a sharp decline in expectations for growth in employment. This is likely a reflection of the tightness of the labor market that has led many businesses to say they are having trouble finding workers to fill open positions. In August, the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent for the third month in a row, and the number of unemployed persons was essentially unchanged at 6.0 million.

Expectations for sales growth also dipped slightly.

The ongoing improvement in expectations for capital spending could indicate improving economic conditions. In its most recent statement, the Federal Reserve pointed to lower levels of business investment in recent months as a source of sluggishness in the U.S. economy.

The Survey’s Business Uncertainty index also declined in September to its lowest level since March. The uncertainty index climbed in the second and third quarter this year as global growth slowed and on-and-off again talks with China clouded the path of trade policies."

“Folks appear to be switching jobs more frequently, and they’re getting not only a wage boost, but a stronger wage boost than in the relative past,” said Nick Bunker, a labor economist at Indeed.com. “This is just another sign of how a stronger tighter labor market helps lower-income workers” to get higher wages, he told the Wall Street Journal.

The data was revealed by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who reported “the rate of transitioning to a new employer for respondents with household income of less than $60,000 reached 12 percent in July 2019—the highest level this series has recorded since its start in July 2014.”

Job-switching is markedly higher for Americans earning less than $60,000, the Fed report said.

The job-switching is helping to push up American salaries. For example, the report includes a chart showing that full-time salaries reached an average of $66,936 in July 2019, up from $57,000 in July 2014.

“Wages are rising, incomes are soaring,” Trump said a September 22 speech in Houston. “In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken over $1,000 extra in rising wages, and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we’ve done.”

The gains are made possible in the tight labor market created by Trump’s combination of lower migration and higher economic growth.

The report says:

The benefits of the tight labor market for workers can be observed from the following chart … [which] displays a significant upward trend in the average salary of full-time workers … this upward trend has been broad-based across age, education, and income groups …. Tight labor markets are generally characterized by increased competition among employers to attract workers.

But the report also notes a much lower rate of job switching among higher-income and older Americans:

For respondents with higher household incomes, this rate has been on a downward trend since March 2018. We observe a similar trend when we analyze the series based on age: since July 2017, employer-to-employer transitions have been rising, for the most part, among younger respondents (under age 45) and declining (toward the series low) for older respondents.

This caution by college-graduate Americans may be caused by pressure from peers and employers, — but may also be caused by the huge number of lower-wage visa-workers who are being used to cold down college salaries.

Nationwide, companies employer roughly 1.5 million foreign college-graduates in U.S. jobs. That huge number is almost twice the number of Americans who will graduate in 2091 with skilled degrees in engineering, mathematics, business, healthcare, science, software, or architecture. Many of the foreign workers will take low salaries — and will work long hours — in the hope of being paid with green cards from their employers.

The number of foreign graduates who compete for U.S. jobs likely will sharply increase if the Senate endorses a bill by Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee that allows employers to offer up to 120,000 visas to Indian employees per year.

The bill is being opposed by numerous groups, including the Multinational Coalition and American for Legal Immigration PAC.

DHS exposes trafficking of Indian graduates to US jobs via B1 & H-1B visas. Smuggled B1s are paid Indian wages so they help Indian CEOs grab white-collar jobs from US grads & companies.

Immigration Numbers

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately 1 million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than 1 million work permits for new foreigners, and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.

But President Donald Trump’s “Hire American” policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, to bring their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work."

Juul said in an announcement that Burns will be replaced by K.C. Crosthwaite, who was an executive at tobacco giant Altria, which holds a minority stake in Juul.

Crosthwaite said in a statement that there’s an “unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry. Against that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate. That includes inviting an open dialogue, listening to others and being responsive to their concerns.”

The San Francisco-based Juul said Wednesday that it is “suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the U.S.”

The company also said that it is “refraining from lobbying the Administration on its draft guidance and committing to fully support and comply with the final policy when effective.”

The Trump administration is preparing a ban on flavored e-cigarettes, which have become popular among young vapers. Juul’s statement on Wednesday suggests that it won’t try to fight the proposed ban.

Vaping has come under fire after a string of deaths linked to e-cigarettes. So far, at least nine deaths have been tied to vaping and e-cigarette use in the U.S.

The Centers for Disease Control recently reported that there have been 530 cases of lung injury in the U.S. from individuals with a history of e-cigarette product use or vaping.

Trump has publicly criticized the youth craze for vaping, saying on Twitter: “While I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes, we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL! Let’s get counterfeits off the market, and keep young children from Vaping!”

The Census Bureau said on Wednesday that new home sales rose 7.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000 units in August. July and June’s sales pace were also revised up.

The three-month moving average, which many economists consider a more reliable indicator of the health of the housing market because it smooths out month-to-month volatility, climbed to 703,000, the fastest pace in nearly 12 years.

Economists polled by Econoday had forecast an annual pace of 662,000 new home sales, a 3.5 percent climb.

Compared with a year ago, sales were up 18 percent.

New home sales appear to be benefitting from the strength of the labor market and lower interest rates. The Fed cut its interest rate target by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its July meeting and mortgage rates are down by more than a percentage point from last year’s high.

Although new home sales account for only 11.5 percent of total housing market sales, they have bigger spill-over effects on the economy. Home building increases demand for labor and new homes need to outfitted with furniture and appliances.

New home sales are counted when contracts are signed. In August, about 63 percent of the homes sold were either under construction or yet to be built. That means the economic benefits of Augusts sales will continue to be felt in the months to come.

Low levels of residential investment had been a drag on the economy, pulling down GDP for six consecutive quarters. That is likely to change now, with residential investment providing a boost to growth this quarter.

Sales were particularly strong in the largest markets for new homes, the South and the West. Sales in the South jumped 6.0 percent. Sales in the West climbed 16.5 percent. Sales were down in the Northeast and the Midwest."

Banks’ rant came just the full transcript of a July phone call between President Donald Trump’ and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was released. Democrats and the establishment media had hyped the call as evidence and proof that President Trump committed impeachable crimes when he said he would withhold military aid to Ukraine unless the country’s leader agreed to launch a probe into Hunter Biden’s business transactions in the country while his father, former Vice President Joe Biden was in office.

But the transcript, released Wednesday, shows “no quid pro quo” Sen. Chuck Grasselty said. President Trump took a victory lap on Wednesday, mocking Democrats, saying ““Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?” he asked on Twitter. “They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise!”

What’s more? Democrats in Congress are terrified and enraged by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announced plan of an “official” impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

As for Elizabeth Banks, she’s likely still coping with Hillary Clinton loss to Trump in 2016.

The Pitch Perfect star was one of many Hollywood figures who appeared in a Funny or Die get out the vote music video, intended to gin up support for Clinton.

Banks also mocked Donald Trump in a politically charged speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

And Banks is just the latest unhinged Hollywood star to float a conspiracy theory about the implications of President Trump’s phone call the Ukraine president.

It seems unlikely that this advice would be taken by the Democratic Party as each member of the House would seek to get their fifteen minutes in the sun to rail against Trump on a national stage. Still, no impeachment proceedings have even been launched.

Despite what many liberals think, however, Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi did not actually advance impeachment on Tuesday when she made her announcement that she supports an impeachment inquiry.

Until there is a move on the floor of the House of Representatives to launch official impeachment proceedings and enter articles of impeachment, no actual impeachment is underway. Pelosi’s proclamation was simply an agreement to keep debating the subject.

Despite what Michael Moore may imagine, Pelosi only advanced the appearance of progress on impeachment. Not an actual impeachment procedure.

The demand, which came from U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), resurfaced Wednesday in an opinion piece written by conservative Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post.

Ironically, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared Tuesday that the mere possibility that President Trump had asked Ukraine to continue an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden — even without a quid pro quo — was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry. (Biden boasted in 2018 that he had forced Ukraine to remove its prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid; he did not tell his audience at the Council on Foreign Relations that the prosecutor was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving.)

Thiessen observed (original links):

It got almost no attention, but in May [2018], CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as “strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,” the Democratic senators declared, “We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,” before demanding Lutsenko “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

The Democrats’ letter is available online here. In it, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy demanded that the Ukrainian government answer their questions about the Mueller probe, and issued an implied threat: “This reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal — to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community — about your government’s commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law.”

“It is a crime for the president to solicit aid for his campaign from a foreign government,” Napolitano said.

“That to which the president has admitted is, in and of itself, a crime,” Smith responded. “Yes,” the judge replied.

It sounded rather damning — except that Smith and Napolitano do not seem to have considered that there might be independent justification for re-opening an inquiry that Biden had ordered closed (with the threat of losing U.S. aid).

Moreover, Napolitano has said many times before that Trump has committed crimes — and he has been wrong:

1. December 2018: Napolitano claimed that Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, had implicated him in a “felony.” (The Southern District of New York investigated and declined to initiate any further prosecutions.)

2. January 2019: Napolitano told Shepard Smith that Mueller would be able to show “collusion” and “conspiracy” because “the campaign had a connection to Russian intelligence.” The Mueller report found no collusion.

3. February 2019: Napolitano claimed that a phone call by the president to Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was “obstruction of justice.” Mueller’s report, released a month later, did not allege any obstruction.

4. April 2019: Napolitano went on an extended rant claiming that Trump had obstructed justice many times — claiming, falsely, that Trump had ordered his aides “to break federal law.” Napolitano called President Trump’s conduct “immoral … criminal … defenseless … [and] condemnable.” In fact, Trump complied fully with Mueller.

5. May 2019: Napolitano claimed that Mueller’s press conference meant that he believed Trump committed crimes and would have charged him if he were allowed to. Mueller clarified in July that that was not, in fact, the reason.

April 2019: Napolitano went on an extended rant claiming that Trump had obstructed justice many times — claiming, falsely, that Trump had ordered his aides “to break federal law.” Napolitano called President Trump’s conduct “immoral … criminal … defenseless … [and] condemnable.” In fact, Trump complied fully with Mueller.

5. May 2019: Napolitano claimed that Mueller’s press conference meant that he believed Trump committed crimes and would have charged him if he were allowed to. Mueller clarified in July that that was not, in fact, the reason.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the Democrat-led House’s impeachment inquiry puts the Democrat Party “in a new direction.”

Her remarks come after months of infighting between far-left members of the “Squad” and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who has tried to dial back the remarks and efforts from the ultra-progressive wing of her caucus.

According to Axios, Ocasio-Cortez welcomed the official inquiry, proclaiming that the effort puts the party “in a new direction.”

“This puts the party in a new direction… The party is unified. The power behind that, and the weight behind that adds an urgency and an expeditiousness to the investigations that I don’t believe we would’ve seen,” Ocasio-Cortez said:

The freshman lawmaker’s declaration follows months of tension over the general direction of the Democrat Party, which boiled over after Pelosi accepted a bipartisan emergency funding package over the “Squad’s” version over the summer. Emotions ran even higher after the speaker dismissed the far-left “Squad” members in a July 6 interview with the New York Times.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez openly aired out the Democrat Party’s dirty laundry on Twitter.

“A glass of water could’ve [beat a 20-yr incumbt]”

“The Green Dream or whatever”

They eventually made amends, meeting at the end of July to clear the air. Pelosi told a reporter following the meeting that the two did not have “that many differences.”

However, the ongoing battle for the heart of the party has not stopped. The impeachment effort has been at the center of the “Squad’s” agenda. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) said on her first day in office that they were going to “impeach the motherfucker.”

Ocasio-Cortez called for impeachment prior to taking office, appearing on the Real America with Jorge Ramos show in November 2018, and calling impeachment a “no-brainer.”

“I mean, yeah. To me, it’s a no-brainer,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Well, I believe that he has violated the law.”

“Violated potentially many laws, whether it’s the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with,” she continued.

“Whether it’s what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence,” she added, mentioning the bar “Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton.”

“But overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me,” she added.

In September, Ocasio-Cortez dared Senate Republicans to go on the record and “knowingly vote against impeachment of this president knowing his corruption” so they can “have that stain on their careers the rest of their lives”:

She took another veiled shot at Democrats last week, tweeting, “At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it”:

Pelosi demonstrated consistent efforts to stall the calls from her far-left colleagues, urging them in a caucus-wide call last month to follow the facts and warning them that the public “isn’t there” yet on impeachment.

As Breitbart News’s Joel Pollak noted:

But Pelosi is no longer waiting for the facts. She will make her stand based on the supposed principle that Congress is entitled to information from a reported whistleblower complaint that the administration has withheld thus far. Yet Pelosi has other avenues, such as the courts, to pursue that information. She has been forced to change her view on impeachment because she no longer controls her caucus.

“AOC and the Squad have won; they hold real power,” he added."

Trump authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of the conversation on Tuesday, and it was released subsequently on Wednesday.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump previewed. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”

The transcript shows Trump asking Zelensky to “find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike”– a reference to ongoing questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts.

The transcript reads:

President Donald Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a

lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess

you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the·whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, ·it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible. President Zelensky: Yes it is. very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to·open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United· States and Ukraine.· For that·purpose, I just recalled our.ambassador from the United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer.

Hunter Biden was brought up after the fact:

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Republican lawmakers across the board agree that there is no smoking gun and “zero” grounds for impeachment.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said he is “incensed by the Fake News media and Socialist Democrats’ distortion of truth” after reading the full transcript of Trump’s conversation and urged Americans to read it for themselves.

He outlined some “noteworthy observations”:

First, President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating “Crowdstrike” (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelenskyy, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond “Crowdstrike. Only thereafter did President Trump mention then-Vice President Joe Biden’s possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son (who was allegedly involved in corrupt practices and may very well have been prosecuted for corruption but for then-Vice President Biden’s monetary threats, coercion and intimidation of Ukraine’s political leadership). Second, in no way, shape or form did President Trump ask Ukraine President Zelenskyy for “campaign help.” There is no request for campaign contributions, campaign volunteers, yard signs or anything else of a campaign nature. Rather, President Trump’s request is very straightforward and an effort to root out and uncover corrupt practices that may (or may not) reach all the way to America’s White House under President Obama and V.P. Biden. Third, I would hope and encourage every President of the United States to root out and uncover corrupt practices in the United States, or by any American citizen anywhere, particularly when the allegations reach to the highest levels of America’s government— the White House! Finally, the Fake News Media and Socialist Democrats are engaged in a fake “Russian Collusion Scandal 2.0,” albeit this time involving Ukraine. The Fake News Media and Socialist Democrats should apologize to the American people for their intentional and knowing distortion of the truth. They won’t, of course, because they care more about advancing a hyper-partisan, Socialist, anti-America agenda than they do telling the American people the truth.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) concurred. “I’ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo. The Ukrainian President admitted problems with corruption in the country and agreed that the issue at hand warranted looking into further,” he said in a statement.

He continued in part:

The firing of a prosecutor looking into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son following pressure from Mr. Biden himself is worthy of investigation. That a president who ran on an anti-corruption platform would look into this matter is unsurprising and is in both the U.S. and Ukrainian national interest. For years, Democrats have decried foreign interference in U.S. elections. But this seems to be a one-way street. Democrats are wholly uninterested in looking into past Ukrainian efforts to help former Vice President Biden, as well as the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, which reportedly used Ukraine to undermine the Trump campaign. That’s not how the rule of law works. National media attention to only one side of this issue is disappointing even if unsurprising. The Obama administration used the Department of Justice and its intelligence agencies to investigate a political opponent in then-candidate Trump while using foreign government sources to further the investigation. But it’s supposedly unacceptable for the Trump administration to encourage a foreign nation to look into a matter that it was prevented from fully investigating by the previous administration with clear conflicts of interest. That’s not a standard that makes any sense.

“Just read transcript of POTUS’ call w/Ukraine Pres. Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote.

“This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!” he added.

“The special counsel wrongfully flipped the legal burden of proof to require President Trump to conclusively determine his innocence. Now Democrats have done the same thing to our national security,” Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) said in a statement.

He continued:

The transcript conclusively determines, despite Democratic promises to the contrary, that there was no quid pro quo. No mention of military aid. No violation of the law. But to conclusively prove his innocence, a classified and privileged conversation between a foreign head of state and our president is now in the public view. In their desire to undo the 2016 election and destroy President Trump, Democrats have today unequivocally and irreparably harmed our national security and compromised an important ally. Instead of forming an impeachment line, Democrats should consider forming an apology line.”

We are ready to·open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United· States and Ukraine.· For that·purpose, I just recalled our.ambassador from the United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer.

Hunter Biden was brought up after the fact:

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Republican lawmakers across the board agree that there is no smoking gun and “zero” grounds for impeachment.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said he is “incensed by the Fake News media and Socialist Democrats’ distortion of truth” after reading the full transcript of Trump’s conversation and urged Americans to read it for themselves.

He outlined some “noteworthy observations”:

First, President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating “Crowdstrike” (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelenskyy, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond “Crowdstrike. Only thereafter did President Trump mention then-Vice President Joe Biden’s possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son (who was allegedly involved in corrupt practices and may very well have been prosecuted for corruption but for then-Vice President Biden’s monetary threats, coercion and intimidation of Ukraine’s political leadership). Second, in no way, shape or form did President Trump ask Ukraine President Zelenskyy for “campaign help.” There is no request for campaign contributions, campaign volunteers, yard signs or anything else of a campaign nature. Rather, President Trump’s request is very straightforward and an effort to root out and uncover corrupt practices that may (or may not) reach all the way to America’s White House under President Obama and V.P. Biden. Third, I would hope and encourage every President of the United States to root out and uncover corrupt practices in the United States, or by any American citizen anywhere, particularly when the allegations reach to the highest levels of America’s government— the White House! Finally, the Fake News Media and Socialist Democrats are engaged in a fake “Russian Collusion Scandal 2.0,” albeit this time involving Ukraine. The Fake News Media and Socialist Democrats should apologize to the American people for their intentional and knowing distortion of the truth. They won’t, of course, because they care more about advancing a hyper-partisan, Socialist, anti-America agenda than they do telling the American people the truth.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) concurred. “I’ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo. The Ukrainian President admitted problems with corruption in the country and agreed that the issue at hand warranted looking into further,” he said in a statement.

He continued in part:

The firing of a prosecutor looking into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son following pressure from Mr. Biden himself is worthy of investigation. That a president who ran on an anti-corruption platform would look into this matter is unsurprising and is in both the U.S. and Ukrainian national interest. For years, Democrats have decried foreign interference in U.S. elections. But this seems to be a one-way street. Democrats are wholly uninterested in looking into past Ukrainian efforts to help former Vice President Biden, as well as the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, which reportedly used Ukraine to undermine the Trump campaign. That’s not how the rule of law works. National media attention to only one side of this issue is disappointing even if unsurprising. The Obama administration used the Department of Justice and its intelligence agencies to investigate a political opponent in then-candidate Trump while using foreign government sources to further the investigation. But it’s supposedly unacceptable for the Trump administration to encourage a foreign nation to look into a matter that it was prevented from fully investigating by the previous administration with clear conflicts of interest. That’s not a standard that makes any sense.

“Just read transcript of POTUS’ call w/Ukraine Pres. Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote.

“This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!” he added.

“The special counsel wrongfully flipped the legal burden of proof to require President Trump to conclusively determine his innocence. Now Democrats have done the same thing to our national security,” Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) said in a statement.

He continued:

The transcript conclusively determines, despite Democratic promises to the contrary, that there was no quid pro quo. No mention of military aid. No violation of the law. But to conclusively prove his innocence, a classified and privileged conversation between a foreign head of state and our president is now in the public view. In their desire to undo the 2016 election and destroy President Trump, Democrats have today unequivocally and irreparably harmed our national security and compromised an important ally. Instead of forming an impeachment line, Democrats should consider forming an apology line.”

“The transcript of the President’s phone call shows no wrongdoing, “ Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.

“The real scandal here is that Democrats are using this issue to distract from wrongdoing by Vice President Biden and his son as they continue to relitigate the 2016 election and attempt to undo the will of the American people,” he added.

In a statement, Pelosi accused President Trump of using “taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.”

“Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” the speaker added. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”

The transcript, released earlier Wednesday, shows President Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Democrats have latched on to the request, claiming the president appeared to have threatened to hold back military aide from Ukraine unless it investigated the Biden family.

“The release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security. The President has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad,” said Pelosi.

On Tuesday, President Trump said he asked White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold the aid from Ukraine roughly one week before he spoke with Ukraine’s leader.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said ahead of his address before the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

During a press conference on Tuesday, Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry in light of the Trump-Zelensky.

“I’m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of an impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable,” she stated.

President Trump on Tuesday blasted Pelosi’s decision to begin proceedings to oust him from the Oval Office, tweeting: “There has been no President in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have.”

“The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,” he added. “They get nothing done.”"

Moderate Democrats who came out in support of impeachment and put their careers on the line are now questioning what is new or different from before.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), one of the House’s most vulnerable Democrats, came out with six other moderate colleagues on Monday evening to back an impeachment inquiry in an op-ed that was seen as a watershed moment in impeachment efforts.

But after a Democrat caucus meeting with Pelosi Tuesday afternoon, Slotkin reportedly said to Democrat colleagues: “If you are asking us to stay on message, give us a g-ddamn message to stay on.”

“We came out [in favor of an impeachment inquiry] because this is something different, this meeting did not give me confidence that this will be something different,” she said.

Pelosi announced Wednesday the House was conducting an “official impeachment inquiry” and the various committee chairmen investigating the president should proceed with that understanding.

Other vulnerable Democrats also appear to be having second thoughts.

According to Politico on Tuesday:

Another first-term Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, raised a similar sentiment about Democrats losing focus on what led the party to this moment, after Pelosi and other key chairmen outlined a multi-step plan for their impeachment inquiry involving the six committees investigating Trump. Several moderates are also privately worried about members of their caucus going too far, with some progressives declaring prematurely that Democrats are ready to imminently impeach Trump.

Impeachment is not popular with the general electorate or independents, according to recent polls.

Their fears could be heightened after Trump released the transcript of the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was the main impetus for the calls for impeachment.

Reports about the call suggested that Trump had offered Ukraine military aid in exchange for investigating Joe Biden’s son.

However, the call transcript showed that there was no such quid pro quo. The two leaders discussed how the U.S. was helping Ukraine with military aid more than Germany and the European Union.

Trump asked if Zelensky could help him get to the bottom of the whole Russian collusion allegations, which he suggested may have started in Ukraine. Zelensky then brought up that one of his assistants recently spoke to Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who is investigating Joe Biden’s son’s dealings in Ukraine.

Trump’s remarks about Biden’s son were in its entirety: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) press conference on Capitol Hill.

Schiff said the newly released transcript of a phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a “classic mafia-like shakedown.”

Schiff said, “This is more damning than I and others had imagined. It is shocking on one level that the White House would release these notes and felt that somehow this would help the president’s case or cause because what those notes reflect is a classic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader. They reflect a Ukrainian president who was desperate for U.S. Support, for military support, to help that country in a hot war with Putin’s Russia, a country that is still occupied by irregular Russian forces, in which people face a very dangerous and continuing and destabilizing action by their aggressive neighbor.”

He continued, “At the same time, a president of the United States who immediately after the Ukraine president expresses the need for further weapons, tells the Ukraine president that he has a favor to ask. The president communicates to his Ukrainian counterpart that the United States has done an awful lot for Ukraine, we’ve done a lot for Ukraine, more than the Europeans have done for Ukraine, but there is not much reciprocity here. This is how a mafia boss talks. ‘I have a favor to ask you.’ And what is that favor? To investigate his political rival, to investigate the Bidens. It’s clear the Ukraine president understands exactly what is expected of him and is making every effort to mollify the president. What adds another layer of depravity to this conversation is the fact that the president of the United States then invokes the attorney general of the United States as well as his personal lawyer as emissaries, in the case of the attorney general, as an official head of a U.S. Department of Justice, to be part and parcel of this.”

He added, “I think in its most naked form, and this is what our inquiry is going to look into, the president has now admitted the notes of this call, and we don’t even know if this is the complete notes of that call, indicate the president of the United States shaking down a foreign leader, essentially undermining the national security of this country, for a personal political gain and one that violates his oath of office.”

The transcript does not provide a “smoking gun,” as Democrat candidates proclaim. Rather, it shows Trump asking the Ukranian leader to further look into the 2016 election meddling roots — something Democrats, given their self-described goals of ensuring election security, would be in favor of.

Trump said:

I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Biden’s son was not mentioned until after the fact:

… I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

As the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel explained:

“This is the smoking gun,” Julián Castro (D) declared. “Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to work with his Justice Department to investigate a political opponent.”

“Congress should cancel recess and begin impeachment proceedings immediately,” he added:

“We need to see the full whistleblower complaint and the administration needs to follow the law,” she continued. “Now”:

The RNC issued a statement urging Biden to be transparent about his dealings after President Donald Trump announced he would release the transcripts of a conversation he had with Ukraine’s new head of state. The conversation had become controversial after Trump urged the Ukrainian government to probe into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country.

“Now that the President has authorized the release of the transcript of his call with President Zelensky, we call on Biden to release the transcripts of his calls as Vice President with Ukrainian and Chinese leaders while his son was conducting shady business deals in those countries,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said.

First it was the Russia hoax. Now it’s the Ukraine hoax. These are the transcripts we actually need to see: Biden's calls with foreign leaders while his son was conducting shady business deals in those countries. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/OTqGze3J1A — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) September 24, 2019

The move comes as Joe Biden is embroiled in controversy over his son’s business dealings with foreign governments. In Ukraine, alone, the younger Biden secured a lucrative appointment to the board of directors of the country’s only independent oil and natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014.

Hunter Biden received the position, which reportedly paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry. Around the same time, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Hunter Biden’s appointment and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption is at the center of the rush by House Democrats to impeach Trump. Many on the left claim Trump allegedly broke the law by suggesting to the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, that he probe into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma.

Joe Biden, himself, echoed that sentiment on Wednesday during a public press conference.

“If President Trump refuses to comply with congressional requests, then he will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said, before refusing to address questions from reporters. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor for Breitbart News, detailed in his book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden profited off extraordinary deals in countries like Ukraine and China that were unavailable to regular citizens.

“Joe Biden became point person to two countries, in particular, Ukraine and in China. And in both cases, his son cashed in,” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on Fox News."

McCarthy spoke to Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday.

“Why aren’t we investigating Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?” asked Rep. McCarthy, “because I’ll promise you this: Hunter Biden — if his name was Hunter Smith, no one would’ve hired him. He wouldn’t have found a billion dollars in China, and an oligarch in Ukraine wouldn’t be hiring him.”

“But why do you have a vice president who’s running for president, who’s number one in the Democratic polls, bragging that he held Ukraine hostage to fire a prosecutor that was gonna investigate his own son?” continued the house minority leader. “Why isn’t anybody up in arms about that? And why is that not being investigated?”

Watch below:

Rep. McCarthy joined The Sean Hannity Show on Tuesday to discuss House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent announcement of the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” — which he described as simply Pelosi’s attempt to “appease the socialist wing of the [Democrat] Party.”

The Ukraine scandal involving Joe and Hunter Biden does, indeed, appear to be a touchy subject for Democrats. On Saturday, Joe Biden snapped at Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, who asked the former vice president about his son’s involvement with Ukraine.

“Here is what I know,” said Biden, whilst pointing his finger repeatedly at Doocy. “I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader? Trying to intimidate a foreign leader? If that’s what happened … that appears what happened.”

“You should be looking at Trump!” exclaimed Biden. “Ask the right questions!”

On Tuesday, Democrats saw to it that the media were looking at President Donald Trump after Pelosi announced a “formal impeachment inquiry” against the president in the wake of his reported comments regarding Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Hunter Biden.

By Wednesday, however, the Democrats’ new strategy was of no avail, as the White House released the entire transcript of President Trump’s July phone call with Zelensky, revealing that neither Trump nor Zelensky discussed authorized military aid payments, which disproves the claims Democrats made.

The eight law enforcement officers were killed from September 18 to September 24. Monday’s most recent attack focused on the operations commander from the municipality of Celaya, according to local reports.

The violence began against a federal officer in charge of the Regional National Intelligence Center (Centro Nacional de Inteligencia or CIN) when he was wounded and his bodyguard was killed on a rural highway. Cartel assassins reportedly stopped Officer Juan José Olvera Soriano’s car and shot Cuauhtémoc Izquierdo, the bodyguard. The assailants beat Olvera Soriano and left him behind.

On Thursday afternoon, a group of gunmen in three SUVs ambushed a convoy of correctional officers transporting prisoners. The attack left five dead and two wounded. The incident occurred on the road connecting Valle De Santiago with Salamanca, a short distance from the Cereso Mil prison.

The next attack occurred on Friday night when gunmen fired a volley of rifle rounds at the offices of the state attorney general’s office, according to local reports. A ministerial police agent identified as Luis Alberto died from gunshot wounds, plus three other officers were wounded with a civilian.

On Saturday at noon, Deputy Police Director Jorge Cisneros Rangel from the municipality of Pénjamo was murdered after being kidnapped during a university lecture. His body was recovered in rural Huanímaro.

Senate Democrats, along with eleven Republicans, voted to pass S.J. Res. 54, which would terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration on the southern border. The resolution was created by Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and co-sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Susan Collins (R-ME).

Sen. Collins said on the Senate floor Wednesday before the vote that the bill is not about “whether you’re for or against a border wall.” The Maine senator, who is up for a tough reelection fight in 2020, claimed that she has “consistently supported” funding for physical barriers on the southern border.

However, Congress has failed to provide significant funding to help secure America’s southern border by building a border wall. With Congress’s failure to provide funding, President Trump declared a national emergency to build the border, which diverted military funding so that he could build a wall along the southern border.

The Republican senators who voted against Trump’s national emergency to build the wall include:

Lamar Alexander (R-TN) Roy Blunt (R-MO) Susan Collins (R-ME) Mike Lee (R-UT) Jerry Moran (R-KS) Rand Paul (R-KY) Rob Portman (R-OH) Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) Mitt Romney (R-UT) Pat Toomey (R-PA) Roger Wicker (R-MS)

All of these Republicans voted in March to terminate the national emergency, and the resolution failed to override a veto-proof majority in the House after Trump vetoed the legislation.

Sen. Marco Rubio voted against the national emergency in March; however, on Wednesday, he did not vote to terminate the national emergency.

Although most of the Republican senators have signaled that they approve of building a wall, it remains to be seen how they will find an avenue to fund that wall without a national emergency declaration, given that Congress has failed to find a legislative solution to finance it."

The vote arises as the Pentagon announced in September that they will delay or suspend 127 military construction projects so that $3.6 billion can be diverted to help secure America’s southern border.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that many Republicans might decide to vote with Democrats because local military bases’ funds have been diverted towards funding the wall.

“I don’t think anyone, no matter what state they are from, will want to see money being taken away from their military installations, [which is] very much needed,” Schumer said Tuesday.

Congressional Democrats failed to pass the resolution to override Trump’s national emergency in March, which failed to override the president’s veto.

Comscore, a company that claims to measure media audiences for entertainment companies and advertisers, has agreed to pay a $5 million fine to settle the charges.

The fraud and false claims charges are particularly notable because Comscore is in the business of providing information and analytics about media and entertainment companies.

The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in orders made public Tuesday that from February 2014 through February 2016, Comscore, at the direction of its former CEO Serge Matta, entered into deals to exchange sets of data without cash consideration but recognized revenue on the fair value of the data received. This had the effect of improperly inflating the company’s revenue, according to the SEC.

The SEC’s said that Comscore and Matta made false and misleading disclosures regarding the company’s customer base and flagship product and that Matta lied to Comscore’s internal accountants and external audit firm. As a result, Comscore artificially exceeded analyst estimates for revenues in seven consecutive quarters, creating an illusion of smooth and steady growth, the SEC alleged.

Melissa R. Hodgman, Associate Director in the SEC’s Enforcement Division:

As the SEC orders find, Comscore and its former CEO manipulated the accounting for non-monetary and other transactions in an effort to chase revenue targets and deceive investors about the performance of Comscore’s business. We will continue to hold issuers and executives accountable for such serious breaches of their fundamental duty to make accurate disclosures to the investing public while giving appropriate credit for a company’s prompt remedial acts and cooperation.

Comscore settled the charges without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, agreeing to cease-and-desist from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay penalties of $5 million. Matta, also without admitting or denying the charges, agreed to pay $700,000 and to reimburse Comscore $2.1 million representing profits from the sale of Comscore stock and incentive-based compensation. He also agreed to an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years."

Internal documents from TikTok, the short-form video app and spiritual successor to the app Vine, appear to show the firm instructing moderators to remove content which may anger the Chinese government according to the Guardian. The company’s content guideline documents break infringing content into two categories: “violations,” and “visible to self.” Violations would see the content removed by videos marked “visible by self” would only be viewable by the people that posted them to the platform, similar to a shadowban.

The Guardian states that the sections which addressed political issues that may anger the Chinese government were designed to look more all-purpose. Politically subversive content would fall under the “visible to self” category according to the Guardian. Business Insider reports that this includes:

Criticizing China’s socialist system was incorporated in a ban on “criticism/attack towards policies, social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, monarchy, parliamentary system, separation of powers, socialism system.”

The “demonization or distortion of local or other countries’ history.” Examples listed included the May 1998 riots of Indonesia, the Cambodian genocide, and Tiananmen Square.

“Highly controversial topics” were banned. These included: “separatism, religion sects conflicts, conflicts between ethnic groups, for instance exaggerating the Islamic sects conflicts, inciting the independence of Northern Ireland, Republic of Chechnya, Tibet and Taiwan and exaggerating the ethnic conflict between black and white.”

The app also forbid the specific mention of 20 current and former world leaders including Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, Mahatma Gandhi, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Kim Jong-un, Shinzo Abe, Park Geun-Hee, Joko Widodo and Narendra Modi. Surprisingly, China’s premier Xi Jinping was not on the list.

TikTok’s parent company ByteDance said in a statement that the outlines were outdated and have since been replaced. ByteDance stated:

In TikTok’s early days we took a blunt approach to minimizing conflict on the platform, and our moderation guidelines allowed penalties to be given for things like content that promoted conflict, such as between religious sects or ethnic groups, spanning a number of regions around the world. As TikTok began to take off globally last year, we recognized that this was not the correct approach, and began working to empower local teams that have a nuanced understanding of each market. As we’ve grown we’ve implemented this localized approach across everything from product, to team, to policy development. The old guidelines in question are outdated and no longer in use. Today we take localized approaches, including local moderators, local content and moderation policies, local refinement of global policies, and more. We also consult with a number of independent local committees and are working to scale this at a global level, including forming an independent committee of leading industry organizations and experts to continually assess these policies. We also understand the need to be more transparent in communicating the policies that we develop and enforce to maintain a safe and positive app environment. Users gravitate to TikTok because it provides an app experience that fosters their creativity, and we are committed to supporting that across our teams, product, policies, and the way in which we openly communicate with our community.

ByteDance purchased the American lip-syncing app Musical.ly in 2017 for $1 billion and combined it with its video app Douyin to create TikTok. The app quickly became the top free non-gaming iOS app in 2018.

Sony vows its upcoming Playstation 5 gaming platform will focus on lower power consumption to save the Earth.

Hollywood Reporter reports that Sony’s PlayStation has “joined forces” with the United Nations environment committee to develop a new partnership called the Playing for the Planet alliance. Sony Interactive Entertainments President and CEO Jim Ryan stated in a blog post: “We believe that careful stewardship of natural resources is of utmost importance and are aligned with the mission and objectives of UN Environment. Earlier this year, they created a new Youth and Environment Alliance and quickly realized partnering with the video game industry would help them reach their sustainable development goals.”

Rya attended the U.N. Climate Summit in New York City recently where the issue of global climate change was discussed by world leaders. Sony has made attempts to reduce the power consumption of its PlayStation 4 console in the past, Ryan said due to the firms efforts the company has avoided carbon emissions that amount to “almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29 million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017).”

Ryan stated that the firms new PlayStation 5 console set to be released next November will also be focused on lowering power consumption: “I am also very pleased to announce the next-generation PlayStation console will include the possibility to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4,” said Ryan. “If just one million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the average electricity use of 1,000 U.S. homes.”

Ryan stated that the firm will be conducting a carbon footprint assessment of its gaming services and will make the data from the study public: “Our commitments are not only related to hardware and operations, we are also keen to help inform people interested in sustainability goals,” said Ryan.

Ryan stated that the firm will also explore potential apps for its VR service which could raise awareness of climate change: “There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games industry to take a stand and support the U.N. Environment team by communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for generations to come,” said Ryan. “We look forward to seeing what the industry can achieve together.”

Josh Hawley (R-MO) sent a letter on Tuesday to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), urging its five commissioners to release the agency’s 2012 report that detailed Google’s anticompetitive policies.

Sen. Hawley sent a letter to the agency’s five commissioners to release the full 2012 report detailing Google’s anticompetitive behavior. Half of the 2012 report released was disclosed in 2015 and detailed that the search engine giant manipulated its search results to bias its own services over Google’s competitors.

“I believe the remaining pages likely contain information critical to the public interest because they may reveal that Google has long been deceiving consumers,” Hawley wrote in his letter to the commissioners.

Sen. Hawley’s letter to the FTC arises as 50 attorneys general have announced an antitrust investigation into Google’s manipulation of the online search and digital advertising markets.

The Missouri senator noted that two years ago, the European Union (EU) fined Google $2.7 billion for manipulating its search results. Hawley contended that Google was “in fact rigging specific search results to favor the interests of Google’s executives.”

Sen. Hawley noted that the 2012 FTC report noted that, citing internet Google documents, that they manipulated their search engine “to bias ourselves.”

He added “Google was misleading consumers about how its algorithm worked” and that “Google systematically deceived consumers,” which provides “real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets.”

Sen. Hawley noted other anticompetitive behavior the search engine engaged in, including:

For example, the report states on pages 28 and 116 that, even as Google told the public it was delivering the most relevant results, it was in fact blacklisting results that it did not like. Google “enter[ed] into exclusive and highly restrictive agreements with web publishers that prevent publishers from displaying competing search results,” and Google “adopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.”

The report provides evidence that Google was deceiving consumers before 2012, and the recent fines levied against Google suggest that Google never stopped. The public has a strong interest in knowing the extent of Google’s pattern of deception so that they can make informed decisions about whether to continue using Google or instead switch to a different service that does not rely on deception.

“I ask you to release the remainder of the report because the public has an interest in knowing how one of the largest, most powerful companies in the world has engaged in deception,” Sen. Hawley concluded in his letter to the FTC.

“We know you are angry, frustrated, tired and sad about these events on campus. We are taking swift action,” said CSU president McConnell in an email addressed to “all students, faculty and staff” obtained by Breitbart News.

McConnell’s email was initially addressing a recent incident in which CSU students were reported to have worn “blackface” — commonly seen in resurfaced photos of left-wing politicians — as well as in regards to a swastika that was allegedly found drawn on a university apartment building.

But then, the university president oddly segued the content of her email from instances of racism, to an upcoming CSU event featuring TPUSA founder and executive director Charlie Kirk.

A TPUSA spokesperson confirmed to Breitbart News that among the students involved in the previously reported “blackface” incident, none of them are or ever have been affiliated with the school’s TPUSA chapter.

“Blackface is racist and dehumanizing. The swastika is an abhorrent and abiding symbol of anti-Semitism,” states McConnell in her email. “Acts of bias and racism are widespread across the country and the globe, but they should not be happening on the CSU campus.”

The university president then went on to say that the campus community must come together to “unanimously reject acts like these, and work on accountability,” before stating — in her next sentence — that she had just “learned” of the upcoming TPUSA event.

“We also learned Wednesday night that a student group exercising its First Amendment right to invite speakers to campus invited Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk to speak on campus on October 22,” said McConnell, bizarrely conflating Kirk and his conservative organization with racism and Nazism.

The university president then accused Kirk’s presence of having “sparked protests” at CSU and on college campuses across the country.

“We know that we must denounce hateful acts swiftly and powerfully and when we do things with negative consequences,” added McConnell, “many of you lose faith that CSU is acting on its Principles of Community.”

“We know you are angry, frustrated, tired and sad about these events on campus. We are taking swift action. We ask you to join with us, not to do all this work yourselves but to help us do the work that will make this a university where hate has no place,” continued the university president.

Charlie Kirk reacted to McConnell’s email in a statement to Breitbart News.

The recent email sent to the entire CSU student body by President Joyce McConnell is as shockingly ignorant as it is dangerously irresponsible. By conflating me and TPUSA with abhorrent racial acts that stand in direct opposition to our organization’s mission, she has placed hundreds of TPUSA chapter members directly in harm’s way. These are students that are part of a student-led chapter in good standing and fully recognized by the university. They are now at risk of being doxed, harassed and even physically assaulted because of President McConnell’s shameful email. This is not hyperbole. We’ve seen similar events at other universities, most recently at UT Austin. All CSU students and parents, along with our entire organization, deserve a prompt correction and a written apology for smearing these amazing young people, students who had zero connection with any recent racist acts at CSU.

Kirk went on to suggest that the university president conduct research before engaging in such rhetoric.

“President McConnell would also do well to review the footage of two recent speeches I’ve given in her own state — one at CSU and another at UC Boulder — where I explicitly condemn white ethno-nationalism as hateful, vile and un-American,” said Kirk.

“Equating good people with hate just because they are conservative, must stop,” he added. “We plan on pursuing every available recourse for this flagrant abuse and defamation by CSU’s president to help ensure that it does.”

You can hear Kirk condemning ethno-nationalism at an event on CSU’s campus last year, here.

At a University of Colorado, Boulder event last year, Kirk stated that “it doesn’t matter where you come from, it doesn’t matter your religion, it doesn’t matter your skin color — we are great because despite the melanin in your skin, or where you come from, you come here, you believe in a core set of ideas, you are an American. Period.”

Moments later, when a CU Boulder student confronted Kirk at the event by claiming that “all of the best” Olympic competitors are of “European stock,” Kirk responded by accusing the student of verging on “white nationalism.”

“I want nothing to do with ethno-nationalism, or anything like that,” affirmed Kirk. “I condemn. I disavow, and that is not true — hold on a second — you don’t understand what you just said, how ridiculous that is — you couldn’t be more wrong.”

Kirk will be speaking at Colorado State University on October 22, alongside featured guest speaker Donald Trump Jr.

“We know you are angry, frustrated, tired and sad about these events on campus. We are taking swift action,” said CSU president McConnell in an email addressed to “all students, faculty and staff” obtained by Breitbart News.

McConnell’s email was initially addressing a recent incident in which CSU students were reported to have worn “blackface” — commonly seen in resurfaced photos of left-wing politicians — as well as in regards to a swastika that was allegedly found drawn on a university apartment building.

But then, the university president oddly segued the content of her email from instances of racism, to an upcoming CSU event featuring TPUSA founder and executive director Charlie Kirk.

A TPUSA spokesperson confirmed to Breitbart News that among the students involved in the previously reported “blackface” incident, none of them are or ever have been affiliated with the school’s TPUSA chapter.

“Blackface is racist and dehumanizing. The swastika is an abhorrent and abiding symbol of anti-Semitism,” states McConnell in her email. “Acts of bias and racism are widespread across the country and the globe, but they should not be happening on the CSU campus.”

The university president then went on to say that the campus community must come together to “unanimously reject acts like these, and work on accountability,” before stating — in her next sentence — that she had just “learned” of the upcoming TPUSA event.

“We also learned Wednesday night that a student group exercising its First Amendment right to invite speakers to campus invited Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk to speak on campus on October 22,” said McConnell, bizarrely conflating Kirk and his conservative organization with racism and Nazism.

The university president then accused Kirk’s presence of having “sparked protests” at CSU and on college campuses across the country.

“We know that we must denounce hateful acts swiftly and powerfully and when we do things with negative consequences,” added McConnell, “many of you lose faith that CSU is acting on its Principles of Community.”

“We know you are angry, frustrated, tired and sad about these events on campus. We are taking swift action. We ask you to join with us, not to do all this work yourselves but to help us do the work that will make this a university where hate has no place,” continued the university president.

Charlie Kirk reacted to McConnell’s email in a statement to Breitbart News.

The recent email sent to the entire CSU student body by President Joyce McConnell is as shockingly ignorant as it is dangerously irresponsible. By conflating me and TPUSA with abhorrent racial acts that stand in direct opposition to our organization’s mission, she has placed hundreds of TPUSA chapter members directly in harm’s way. These are students that are part of a student-led chapter in good standing and fully recognized by the university. They are now at risk of being doxed, harassed and even physically assaulted because of President McConnell’s shameful email. This is not hyperbole. We’ve seen similar events at other universities, most recently at UT Austin. All CSU students and parents, along with our entire organization, deserve a prompt correction and a written apology for smearing these amazing young people, students who had zero connection with any recent racist acts at CSU.

Kirk went on to suggest that the university president conduct research before engaging in such rhetoric.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) engaged in the most dishonest and shameless act of cultural appropriation imaginable, and the so-called Woke Movement is giving her a total pass.

These Woke Puritans on the left claim to be all about racial sensitivity, about opposing white privilege, about not offending people of color. They’re so rabid they swarm to attack nobody high schoolers who wear “problematic” prom dresses, white college kids who wear dreadlocks, even children who trick-or-treat as an Indian chief or an Eskimo or a Mexican bandit or an Arab.

This is supposed to be the New Sensitivity, right?

We’re supposed to be “perfecting” our society into something more pure and decent, right?

Well, then, explain to me just how in the hell a kid in a sombrero is “problematic” and not a 70-year-old white woman who spent decades wearing the equivalent of “redface” to advance herself?

For decades, Elizabeth Warren committed the most audacious act of cultural appropriation I have ever seen in a national politician. For decades, Warren pretended to be a Cherokee Indian, and to this day, even though her DNA test proves she’s has no more native blood (and probably less) than the average white American, she still hasn’t admitted she is not part Cherokee.

To everyday Americans, it’s her cheating that galls us; it’s someone pretending to be someone she’s not as a means to gain an advantage that galls us.

The Puritan Wokesters, though, if they actually were who they say they are, if they actually stood for what they say they stand for, should be apoplectic over Cherokee Warren, because what she did is not only outrageous, is not only a privileged white woman stealing a cultural identity purely for mercenary purposes, but you also have to ask yourself how many real-life people of color were not hired or promoted or given an opportunity because Cherokee Warren had already filled that slot?

What more proof is there that the Woke Movement is a total fraud filled with partisan liars. Here Warren is surging in the Democrat primary to a point where the Democrat presidential nomination is probably hers to lose. The latest polls show her up in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary states, and so far she has paid zero price from the Woke Police for decades and decades and decades of cultural appropriation.

Look at it this way…

If your child dresses as a Cherokee Indian this Halloween, the Woke-tards will be coming after you and him.

But Elizabeth Warren can spend decades pretending to be a Cherokee Indian as a means to get rich and famous and powerful, and these same people refuse to utter a peep.

According to a column published by Flynn on Quillette this week, Emerald Press has decided against publishing Flynn’s upcoming book, In Defense of Free Speech: The University as Censor, which makes the case that institutions of higher learning freely censor political expression.

In June, Emerald Press sent Flynn a letter to notify him that they would not be publishing the book. In the letter, the publishing house said that they would not publish content that addresses the “sensitive topics of race, religion, and gender.”

I am contacting you in regard to your manuscript In Defense of Free Speech: The University as Censor. Emerald believes that its publication, in particular in the United Kingdom, would raise serious concerns. By the nature of its subject matter, the work addresses sensitive topics of race, religion, and gender. The challenging manner in which you handle these topics as author, particularly at the beginning of the work, whilst no doubt editorially powerful, increase the sensitivity and the risk of reaction and legal challenge. As a result, we have taken external legal advice on the contents of the manuscript and summarize our concerns below.

The letter goes on to make the case that the book could incite “racial hatred” and “religious hatred” in the United Kingdom. Emerald Press admits that Flynn has “no intention” of inciting hatred but that intent doesn’t matter anymore. The letter goes on to suggest that the book could potentially violate the United Kingdom’s speech laws.

There are two main causes of concern for Emerald. Firstly, the work could be seen to incite racial hatred and stir up religious hatred under United Kingdom law. Clearly you have no intention of promoting racism but intent can be irrelevant. For example, one test is merely whether it is “likely” that racial hatred could be stirred up as a result of the work. This is a particular difficulty given modern means of digital media expression. The potential for circulation of the more controversial passages of the manuscript online, without the wider intellectual context of the work as a whole and to a very broad audience—in a manner beyond our control—represents a material legal risk for Emerald.

Flynn’s article includes his own synopsis of the book, which ends with a quote from George Orwell:

Discussing why free speech should extend to questions of race and gender necessarily involves presenting views (such as those of Jensen, Murray, and Lynn), if only for purposes of rebuttal, which upset those who believe that racial and sexual equality is self-evident. If upsetting students or staff or the public is a reason for banning speech, all such discussion is at an end. I end the book by quoting from George Orwell’s original preface to Animal Farm, which was itself rejected by Faber and Faber for being too critical of Stalin: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”

Flynn claims that he is reaching out to other publishers that might be interested in publishing the book. For now, due to leftist sensitivities and draconian speech laws, Flynn’s book on free speech is without a publisher and an audience."

The first-year student, who lived in a single-occupancy dorm room, was found after the student’s father contacted the police. Some students had complained about a strong odor that emanated out from under the student’s door.

Chris Hipkins, New Zealand’s education minister, has called for a thorough investigation into the officials that were responsible for residents in the building. “If you’re going into a hall of residence or a hostel, you are paying top dollar for not just a roof over your head but also the pastoral care that goes with that,” Hipkins said. “And I think clearly that’s not been present in this case.”

Bex Bryan, a former residential advisor at the University of Canterbury, expressed concern about the lack of professionalism from the current staff. Bryan claims that she had daily contact with all of the students for which she was responsible.

“We had DAILY contact with all our students we were responsible for. We planned weekend activities and we knew who was away and when,” Bryan wrote in a Facebook post. “This poor young man, my heart bleeds for his family.

UNC released a letter to the Education Department on Friday, stating that the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies (CMES) contains relevant education material in compliance with Title VI, according to a report by the Chicago Tribune.

The university had been responded to an August 29 letter from the Education Department, which informed both UNC and Duke University that the schools would risk losing federal funds if they did not revise their joint Middle Eastern studies program by September 22.

The department argued that the program focused heavily on the “positive aspects of Islam” while severely lacking education regarding the positive aspects of Christianity and Judaism, as well as offering very few, if any, programs focused on the historic discrimination against religious minorities in the Middle East.

The department added that the program’s offerings are “plainly unqualified for taxpayer support,” as investigators looking into the matter had concluded that foreign language and national security “have taken a back seat to other priorities.”

According to the report, UNC’s vice chancellor for research Terry Magnuson says that the university started offering Arabic classes in 1959, adding that UNC now has the country’s highest enrollment in the Urdu language, as well as the eighth-highest enrollment in both the Arabic and Turkish languages.

Magnuson also claims that the program does provide sufficient education on national security, stating that UNC hosts several programs each year on such topics, some including featured speakers from the Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George Bush administrations.

In its letter, the Education Department had also noted a program focused on “Iranian art and film,” stating that CMES had not clearly demonstrated how such a program is secondary to more rigorous and relevant coursework.

In his rebuke, Magnuson also insisted that “Iranian art and film” does, in fact, improve language acquisition, as well as attract new students to the program.

With regards to the program lacking balance by not offering programs focused on the historic discrimination against religious minorities in the Middle East, Magnuson contested the claim, stating that CMES has held events regarding the persecution of Armenian Christians and other religious minorities.

Magnuson also said that the program “suffuses” with regards to the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism and other religions. The report added that Magnuson will be establishing an advisory board to address the matter at hand, and will keep records detailing the ways in which UNC’s expenses are applicable to the goal of the federal grant.

UNC released a letter to the Education Department on Friday, stating that the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies (CMES) contains relevant education material in compliance with Title VI, according to a report by the Chicago Tribune.

The university had been responded to an August 29 letter from the Education Department, which informed both UNC and Duke University that the schools would risk losing federal funds if they did not revise their joint Middle Eastern studies program by September 22.

The department argued that the program focused heavily on the “positive aspects of Islam” while severely lacking education regarding the positive aspects of Christianity and Judaism, as well as offering very few, if any, programs focused on the historic discrimination against religious minorities in the Middle East.

“Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?” he asked on Twitter. “They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise!”

Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019

The president released the transcript shortly after his message on Twitter, which revealed that Trump spoke to Zelensky about the investigation of meddling in the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s possible corrupt behavior in the country.

Below is the relevant portion of the transcript

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me. President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I’m knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament; the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.

The president asked Zelensky to coordinate with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to discuss the investigations.

“Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy,” he said. “If you could speak to him that would be great.”

The president also pointed to a Breitbart News report that Democrats also reached out to Ukraine to ask officials to cooperate with an investigation."

According to a memo released by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel on Wednesday, the inspector general stated that it received a complaint of “urgent concern,” though the OLC determined the matter “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” or require that the national intelligence director send the complaint to House and Senate intelligence committees.

The OLC memo reads that the so-called “whistleblower” exhibited signs of “political bias,” yet the inspector general still found the still-anonymous individual to be credible.

“Although the ICIG’s preliminary review found ‘some indica of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,’ the ICIG concluded that the complaint’s allegations nonetheless appeared credible,” reads the opinion.

Fox News correspondent Ed Henry was first to report on the allegations of “political bias” in favor of a Trump rival on Tuesday evening.

Further, the inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the director of national intelligence in August that he believed the conversation between President Trump and Ukraine’s leader could have been a federal campaign finance violation because the president could have been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a Justice Department official said.

The whistleblower — a member of the intelligence community — said in their complaint that they had heard the information from “White House officials,” but did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, the Justice Department official said.

Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and there was no consideration of the department’s policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, the official said.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the attorney general was first notified of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president “several weeks after the call took place,” when the department received the referral about potential criminal conduct.

“The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine — on this or any other matter,” the spokeswoman said.

Lawmakers have been demanding details of the whistleblower’s complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is to testify Thursday before the House, and lawmakers are expected to have access to details of the complaint beforehand in a classified setting.

The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American political events, leading House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to yield to mounting pressure from fellow Democrats on the impeachment inquiry.

Congress’ probe focuses partly on whether President Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government to undermine Biden and help his own re-election. Pelosi said such actions would mark a “betrayal of his oath of office” and declared, “No one is above the law.”

Meanwhile, the White House released a transcript Wednesday of a phone call between President Trump and Zelensky that’s at the center of the impeachment investigation.

House Democrats are examining the call to determine whether President Trump threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine in exchange for Zelensky’s government investigating the family of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Tens of millions in military aid was ultimately released to Ukraine this month, but investigators want to know what prompted Trump to threaten to withhold payment.

According to the five-page transcript, there were several references to Biden, but neither President Trump nor Zelensky discussed authorized military aid payments. They did discuss Biden’s son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukraine gas company between 2014 and early this year.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” President Trump told Zelensky. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … it sounds horrible to me.”

Following the transcript’s release, the president mocked Democrats in a tweet, writing: “Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise!”

Conway, a staunch critic of President Trump, wrote on Twitter that Senate Republicans would withhold their position on impeachment for as long as possible and then ultimately vote to oust the president.

“I agree with this. There may be Republican senators who won’t say a word until the moment they say “guilty” when the roll is called at the end of an impeachment trial,” tweeted Conway in response to author Tony Schwartz, who opined that Republican senators will vote to impeach because they “privately hate” the president.

Conway’s bold prediction comes after he urged House Democrats over the weekend to pursue impeachment in the wake of reports that President Trump suggested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky ask his government to re-open a corruption inquiry into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

“Trump has already done more than enough to warrant impeachment and removal,” Conway wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post. “The current whistleblowing allegations, however, are even worse.”

The conversation between President Trump and Zelensky is part of a complaint by a so-called “whistleblower and is central to a formal impeachment probe announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Tuesday. On Wednesday, President Trump made good on his vow to release the transcript of the July 25th phone call, which shows (as the president confirmed this week, that he suggested Ukraine’s leader to looking into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the eastern European country.

Following the transcript’s release, President Trump called the formal impeachment inquiry the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.” He also stated of the call was, in fact, “a nothing call.”

Conway, a staunch critic of President Trump, wrote on Twitter that Senate Republicans would withhold their position on impeachment for as long as possible and then ultimately vote to oust the president.

“I agree with this. There may be Republican senators who won’t say a word until the moment they say “guilty” when the roll is called at the end of an impeachment trial,” tweeted Conway in response to author Tony Schwartz, who opined that Republican senators will vote to impeach because they “privately hate” the president.

Conway’s bold prediction comes after he urged House Democrats over the weekend to pursue impeachment in the wake of reports that President Trump suggested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky ask his government to re-open a corruption inquiry into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

“Trump has already done more than enough to warrant impeachment and removal,” Conway wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post. “The current whistleblowing allegations, however, are even worse.”

The conversation between President Trump and Zelensky is part of a complaint by a so-called “whistleblower and is central to a formal impeachment probe announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Tuesday. On Wednesday, President Trump made good on his vow to release the transcript of the July 25th phone call, which shows (as the president confirmed this week, that he suggested Ukraine’s leader to looking into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the eastern European country.

Following the transcript’s release, President Trump called the formal impeachment inquiry the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.” He also stated of the call was, in fact, “a nothing call.”

“Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise!” he later tweeted."

“The president of the United States has betrayed our country,” Clinton claimed in a tweet. “That’s not a political statement—it’s a harsh reality, and we must act.”

“He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free,” she continued. “I support impeachment”:

Clinton’s declaration follows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) formal announcement of an impeachment inquiry into the president – spurred, in part, from a whistleblower complaint – and coincides with the release of the unredacted text of Trump’s call with Ukraine President Zelensky. The transcript of the call did not provide the smoking gun hoped for by Democrats:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fears the Democrat-led House impeachment effort could lead President Trump to ultimately claim vindication, he told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Nancy Pelosi: ""Therefore today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" pic.twitter.com/HyHKD39N7M — Axios (@axios) September 24, 2019

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

She continued, “[W]hen you talk about what Mueller did, certainly, that report was not conclusive about collusion, but it gave us ample information about obstruction of justice, referring back to Comey and some of the other things that the president has done that certainly is obstruction of justice.”

Sandy Phillips’ daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of 12 people killed in the suburban Denver theater during a midnight showing of the Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” also distributed by Warner Bros.

Phillips said she and four other people who lost loved ones in Aurora sent a letter to Warner on Tuesday, asking the studio to lobby Congress for gun control, support survivor programs and end any contributions to politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.

“When we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called ‘Joker’ that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,” the letter reads. “We want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility.”

Warner issued a statement later Tuesday saying it has always supported victims of gun violence and calling on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address what it called an epidemic.

Phillips says she was compelled to act after seeing a trailer for “Joker,” the name of the Batman villain portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film being released Oct. 4.

“My jaw dropped. I went, ‘Oh my god.’ And that was just the trailer. I was immediately triggered,” she said.

“Our purpose is to make the movie studios, the directors, the actors aware that when they make movie like this, they affect us directly,” Phillips said. “For someone who idolizes mass shooters, idolizes guns, that’s the kind of movie they absolutely love.”

Phillips’ support group, “Survivors Empowered,” and activist Igor Volsky of Guns Down America sent the letter to Warner CEO Ann Sarnoff.

“Companies like Warner have real leverage where Congress has failed,” said Volsky, citing recent actions by Walmart to stop selling handgun and short-barrel rifle ammunition after a string of mass shootings. “That’s why we are not calling for a boycott of this film. They have an opportunity to lead on this issue.”

“Joker” has been the subject of much debate since it premiered late last month at the Venice International Film Festival, where it won the top prize. It’s also expected to be a major awards contender.

The film is a character study of how Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian and clown-for-hire, becomes the classic Batman nemesis.

Director and co-writer Todd Phillips told the AP last month that the villain portrayed by Phoenix is presented in an “empathetic way.”

“You’re kind of on his side until you can’t be any longer,” Todd Phillips said.

Todd Phillips also questioned why some are conflating “Joker” with the movie theater shooting in Aurora in 2012.

“Aurora is obviously a horrible, horrible situation,” Todd Phillips said. “But even that is not something you blame on the movie.”

Prosecutors and a psychiatrist who evaluated Aurora shooter James Holmes have discounted some initial press reports that Holmes had told authorities he was the Joker.

Phoenix told the AP that he thinks it’s a good thing for movies to challenge an audience and that it’s not incumbent on the film or filmmaker to hold back because of how an audience might misinterpret the message.

“I don’t think it’s the filmmaker’s responsibility to teach morality,” Phoenix said. “And if you don’t know the difference between right and wrong, then there’s all sorts of things that you are going to interpret in the way that you want.”

“Make no mistake: Neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind,” the Warner statement said. “It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.”

Tom Sullivan, whose son, Alex, was killed while celebrating his 27th birthday inside the Aurora theater, said he wasn’t aware of efforts to send the letter until late Monday and didn’t sign it but that he supported Sandy Phillips’ endeavor. He also said he saw the film’s debut differently.

“I’m not afraid of the movie. I don’t think someone is going to watch it and go into their closet and pull out their firearms and do something tragic. That sort of process takes a long time,” said Sullivan, who has counseled shooting victims across the country and was elected a Democratic state lawmaker last year.

″‘Joker’ is art,” said Sullivan, “and art is supposed to create conversations.”

The Aurora theater was remodeled and renamed after the 2012 shooting that also wounded 58 people. Holmes was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Reached by telephone, an employee at Century Aurora and XD said Tuesday there were no immediate plans to show “Joker” at the theater but referred calls for comment to Cinemark spokesman James Meredith.

Meredith didn’t immediately return those calls."

Sandy Phillips’ daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of 12 people killed in the suburban Denver theater during a midnight showing of the Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” also distributed by Warner Bros.

Phillips said she and four other people who lost loved ones in Aurora sent a letter to Warner on Tuesday, asking the studio to lobby Congress for gun control, support survivor programs and end any contributions to politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.

“When we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called ‘Joker’ that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,” the letter reads. “We want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility.”

Warner issued a statement later Tuesday saying it has always supported victims of gun violence and calling on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address what it called an epidemic.

Phillips says she was compelled to act after seeing a trailer for “Joker,” the name of the Batman villain portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film being released Oct. 4.

“My jaw dropped. I went, ‘Oh my god.’ And that was just the trailer. I was immediately triggered,” she said.

“Our purpose is to make the movie studios, the directors, the actors aware that when they make movie like this, they affect us directly,” Phillips said. “For someone who idolizes mass shooters, idolizes guns, that’s the kind of movie they absolutely love.”

Phillips’ support group, “Survivors Empowered,” and activist Igor Volsky of Guns Down America sent the letter to Warner CEO Ann Sarnoff.

“Companies like Warner have real leverage where Congress has failed,” said Volsky, citing recent actions by Walmart to stop selling handgun and short-barrel rifle ammunition after a string of mass shootings. “That’s why we are not calling for a boycott of this film. They have an opportunity to lead on this issue.”

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced Tuesday that she is beefing up her presidential campaign as she surges in several primary polls across the country.

In a memo to supporters, campaign manager Roger Lau wrote the campaign will grow its presence in Flordia, Texas, California, Illinois, Maine, and Georgia, as well as hire additional staff to help support Democrats running in competitive state legislature races in Michigan and Minnesota.

“Remember: this election is about more than just beating Donald Trump — he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system,” Lau wrote. “If we want to make big, structural change, we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country,” explained Lau.

Further, the campaign said it hopes to increase resources for volunteers with a canvassing app to enable them to converse with voters.

“This is how we dream big, fight hard, and win. We’ve got a plan to make sure Elizabeth is the next president of the United States. And when she’s in the Oval Office — when our plans go from big ideas to reality with the help of this grassroots movement — I want you to know that you helped make it happen,” Lau continued.

The announcement comes as the Warren campaign readies an eight-figure ad buy in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.

“At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election — by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,” Lau said of the television blitz.

Meanwhile, Warren has solidified her status as the frontrunner in the Democrat presidential primary contest this week, two newly-released polls show.

Politico reports:

Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a new poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support.

Though some polls show Warren pulling ahead of Biden in some early primary and caucus states, a Real Clear Politics polling average shows the Massachusetts Democrat still trails the former vice president by roughly ten percent."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

Business Insider reports that Facebook has announced that it won’t be removing tweets from politicians that violate the rules of the site for fear of stifling political discourse. Facebook’s most senior spokesman, Nick Clegg, said at The Atlantic Festival in Washington D.C. on Tuesday that Facebook is taking steps to prepare for upcoming political elections and discussed how the site is changing its attitude towards political speech on its platform.

Clegg stated in his speech that Facebook will be cracking down on fake accounts will be making efforts to reduce the spread of fake news but that politicians’ speeches and political debates will not be fact-checked and will be allowed on the site even if they break Facebook’s rules. “Freedom of expression is an absolute founding principle for Facebook,” Clegg said.

Clegg continued to state: “Since day one, giving people a voice to express themselves has been at the heart of everything we do. We are champions of free speech and defend it in the face of attempts to restrict it. Censoring or stifling political discourse would be at odds with what we are about.”

Many appeared to disagree with Facebook’s decision, Alex Newhouse, an extremism researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies stated in a tweet: “To give politicians essentially free reign to lie, gaslight, and spread hate on the largest social platform on the planet isn’t just misguided, it’s actively dangerous, violent, and anti-society.”

But others believe that Facebook should not be making decisions about what political speech is or is not acceptable. Associate professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, Daniel Kreiss, stated: “[This] is primarily a political, not a media, problem in my view, and Facebook simply does not have the legitimacy to solve that.”

Clegg did state that the site would become involved in situations “where speech endangers people,” and that political ads would continue to be regulated.

Just several minutes earlier, the Who’s the Boss? actress called for Trump’s impeachment, with a tweet saying: “We can not wait any longer. #ImpeachTrumpNow.”

Messing took a similar approach by tweeting early Tuesday morning, “EVERYTHING CAN WAIT. REGISTER TO VOTE.”

EVERYTHING CAN WAIT. REGISTER TO VOTE!🇺🇸

Later in the morning, the Will & Grace star exhorted her followers to support impeachment proceedings against the President.

“The dam is breaking!” Messing tweeted. “We could start impeachment proceedings for real. We need to put the pressure on TODAY.”

Other Hollywood figures who launched similar messages include Judd Apatow and actress Piper Perabo.

The Angle Has Fallen actress tweeted her support of voter registration and Trump impeachment.

“Who chooses the Supreme Court justices won’t change unless you vote. You can’t vote unless you register. Go here to register, and try to find 3 new people to register today,” the actress wrote

Perabo also posted her support for impeachment, saying “in case you’ve been busy … Trump said on TV that he asked the head of Ukraine to investigate Biden. And one can’t use the office of President to go after political rivals, that falls under high crimes and misdemeanors.”

The actor then tweeted out his support for presidential impeachment.

The official Twitter account for TV talk show host Samantha Bee celebrated Tuesday with a pair of tweets on voter registration and impeachment. “Make sure you register to vote so we can get a president who correctly ‘uses’ quotation marks.”

Smollett was written out of the show after the Chicago Police Department not only found no evidence that there was any hate crime perpetrated against the actor but also found proof that Smollett engineered a fake attack himself just to get publicity.

Despite that massive embarrassment for the show, Empire went full Trump derangement with its first episode with a scene depicting series star Taraji P. Henson’s “Cookie” appearing on a TV show patterned after ABC’s The View, in which expressed her hope that the president would end up in jail.

As the character appeared on the faux talk show, Cookie went off on Trump as soon as his name was mentioned, saying, “please tell me they finally threw his lying ass in prison.”

The talk show’s ersatz Meghan McCain, “Lizzie” (Carisa Barreca), struck back with a snide comment noting that Cookie had been in jail herself, but for the most part, Empire portrayed Cookie as the crowd favorite for her attack on Trump.

Meanwhile, former Empire star Jussie Smollett is still not off the hook for what the Chicago Police Department determined was a hoax hate crime report. Indeed, the county prosecutor who surprised the city by declining to prosecute Smollett for the incident is now under investigation for her failure to charge Smollett.

The Raiders of the Lost Ark star spoke Monday at an event at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York where he gave an impassioned speech that focused primarily on the fires that have been consuming large sections of the Amazon.

He said the Amazon is “crucial to any climate change solution,” for its “capacity to sequester carbon, for its biodiversity, for its fresh water, for the air we breath, for our morality.”

Ford said the protection and preservation of the rainforest “can achieve at least 30% of the emissions reductions we need to protect the planet.”

Later in the speech, the actor praised young climate activists, saying that their generation has been failed when it comes to the environment.

“They are a moral army and the most important thing we can do for them is too get the hell out of their way,” Ford said.

The U.N. Climate Action Summit, which concluded Monday, featured appearances by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, who along with 15 other children filed a complaint with the U.N., accusing five countries of inaction on combatting so-called climate change.

Ford said in his speech that “greed is winning the battle for the Amazon.”

“What we’ve done to preserve the Amazon… is being purposefully undone. We need to protect what we have. We need to restore what we’ve lost.”

The actor called for the defunding of tax incentives and other mechanisms that “fuel deforestation.”

Ford said, “without the Amazon… we cannot achieve a climate solution and nothing else we do will matter.”

During the speech, the 77-year-old actor fumbled with his note cards and appeared to lose his way more than once, saying “in the movies, we get to do it over.”

The Star Wars actor is a well-known flying enthusiast who enjoys piloting private aircraft. Social media reaction to his speech noted how the actor’s emotional pleas clashed with his love of gas-guzzling planes.

The announcement, first reported by Reuters, says the Right Livelihood Foundation selected Thunberg for the award “for inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.”

“I’m deeply grateful for being one of the recipients of this great honor,” Thunberg told the Guardian UK. “But of course, it is not me who is the winner. I am part of a global movement of school children, youth and adults of all ages who have decided to act in defence of our living planet. I share this award with them.”

Recipients of this year’s award include women’s rights attorney Guo Jianmei, human rights activist Aminatou Haidar, and indigenous leader Davi Kopenawa. The award comes with a cash prize of around $100,000.

“With the 2019 Right Livelihood Award, we honour four practical visionaries whose leadership has empowered millions of people to defend their inalienable rights and to strive for a liveable future for all on planet Earth,” Right Livelihood Foundation said in a statement.

The development comes after Thunberg chastized world leaders this week at the United Nations General Assembly for what she described as their inaction against purported climate change.

“This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!,” Thunberg said in her accusatory speech.

“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!” she added.

Thunberg and 15 other children filed a complaint with the United Nations on Monday, accusing five countries of inaction on combatting so-called global warming.

The complaint, filed with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, accuses Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey of failing to fulfill their obligations to act against climate change, placing them in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a three-decade-old human rights treaty which sets out the civil rights of children.

“Change needs to happen now if we are to avoid the worst consequences. The climate crisis is not just the weather. It means also, lack of food and lack of water, places that are unlivable and refugees because of it. It is scary,” Thunberg said in a statement upon announcing the complaint.

The complaint does not name China, which accounts for 30 percent of global emissions, as it has not signed the part of the Convention on the Rights of the Child treaty allowing children to seek justice for breaching the agreement.

The complaint drew awe from French President Emmanuel Macron, one of the world’s most ardent supporters of the Paris climate agreement, who accused Thunberg of holding a “very radical” towards France and warned it would likely “antagonize societies.”

Brune Poirson, France’s Ecological Transition Minister, agreed with Macron, telling French radio station France Inter: “I am not sure that you mobilize people with despair, with what is almost hatred, setting people against each other.”"

The student-led movement, dubbed on social media #SYATP, launched in 1990 by a group of Texas students, reported Fox News.

The annual event, which CBN reports is now part of the Global Week of Student Prayer, draws about one million students throughout America and in more than 64 nations around the world.

Australian Christian singers Joel and Luke Smallbone of For King & Country promoted See You at the Pole in a video:

“This has always been something that has been close to me and my heart because I’ve been able to see the power of prayer and to be able to see when school students get together and surround that flag and be able to pray together, something real significant takes place,” Luke Smallbone said.

City Council Paralyzed by Homeless Crisis,"A member of the Los Angeles City Council is set to introduce a resolution Wednesday calling on California Governor Gavin Newsom to declare a “state of emergency” regarding the state’s growing homeless population.

In an op-ed in the Los Angeles Daily News on Tuesday, city council member Joe Buscaino wrote that state and local bureaucracies were preventing the city from helping homeless people and cleaning up the streets:

During the past several years, my staff and I have been working tirelessly to secure funding and approval for projects that will move people experiencing homelessness from sidewalk encampments into housing, including nearly 300 temporary emergency shelter beds, 500 permanent supportive housing units, and a homeless storage facility. We have also worked to develop immediate and near-term solutions that address the real world, street-level consequences of sidewalk encampments, and help protect public health and safety; including mobile restrooms, mobile showers, storage, off-street safe parking, and even hiring homeless individuals to pick up litter.

Each of these solutions has been implemented at an excruciatingly slow pace, with roadblocks and red tape imposed by numerous government bureaucracies — including several in our own city — at every step of the way.

Buscaino argued that a “state of emergency” declaration under state law would give Gov. Newsom to “the authority to suspend any statute, rule or regulation, if he believes strict compliance would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency.”

Meanwhile, the city council failed to move forward Tuesday evening on a new proposal to limit the areas in which homeless people can sleep on the sidewalks. The Daily News reported that advocates for the homeless protested the idea of clearing out homeless encampments before alternative shelter was available. Concerned residents complained about finding hundreds of hypodermic needles near homeless encampments, and that many residents of the camps did not want to use rehabilitation services.

The Los Angeles Times added: “Progressive activists have called to end the criminalization of homeless people and roll back rules that bar sleeping on sidewalks. Some community groups, in turn, want the city to ramp up enforcement of such rules to eliminate filth and blight.”

One of the thorniest problems is whether the federal courts would even allow the city to clear homeless people off the streets, after last year’s ruling in Martin v. Boise, when the Ninth Circuit held that punishing homeless people for sleeping on the street when there was no shelter available elsewhere violated their Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.

The city is facing an urgent public health crisis, as the homeless population has soared to nearly 60,000 people, many of whom have no access to bathroom facilities. Last week, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson visited the city and warned of a potential “epidemic.”

President Donald Trump has suggested that the federal government could intervene, using its own emergency powers — a proposal that Gov. Newsom and local leaders reject, though they have no solutions of their own.

The Daily News reported that advocates for the homeless protested the idea of clearing out homeless encampments before alternative shelter was available. Concerned residents complained about finding hundreds of hypodermic needles near homeless encampments, and that many residents of the camps did not want to use rehabilitation services.

The Los Angeles Times added: “Progressive activists have called to end the criminalization of homeless people and roll back rules that bar sleeping on sidewalks. Some community groups, in turn, want the city to ramp up enforcement of such rules to eliminate filth and blight.”

One of the thorniest problems is whether the federal courts would even allow the city to clear homeless people off the streets, after last year’s ruling in Martin v. Boise, when the Ninth Circuit held that punishing homeless people for sleeping on the street when there was no shelter available elsewhere violated their Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.

The city is facing an urgent public health crisis, as the homeless population has soared to nearly 60,000 people, many of whom have no access to bathroom facilities. Last week, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson visited the city and warned of a potential “epidemic.”

President Donald Trump has suggested that the federal government could intervene, using its own emergency powers — a proposal that Gov. Newsom and local leaders reject, though they have no solutions of their own.

Kohn was caught on a San Diego beach as he fled arresting officers. The accused and his company, Future Income Payments, were indicted in Greenville, South Carolina, in March. Federal charges included conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and wire fraud.

A civil suit has also been filed by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, asking for an order that Kohn and his various corporate entities pay more than a half billion dollars.

“It’s one of the largest, if not the largest, fraud case brought in the district of South Carolina,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Watkins told The Greenville News and Anderson Independent Mail. Kohn allegedly targeted veterans and unwary investors in what his former employees described as a “one billion dollar Ponzi scheme.”

Authorities said Kohn spent his ill-gotten gains on multi-million dollar houses in Los Angeles and Los Vegas, as well as luxury cars and expensive artwork.

Kohn offered cash advances to ex-military personnel in exchange for money from their benefits or pensions, but neglected to mention that selling those benefits is against the law. He also allegedly neglected to inform his victims that they would be charged up to 240 percent interest on the sketchy loans.

He then allegedly sold their debt to investors, promising as much as an 8 percent return and pocketing the remainder. And while Kohn’s defense has maintained that his “purchase agreements” with this vulnerable population should be considered exempt from state and federal laws, five judges — both state and federal — have disagreed.

More than 15 states have now issued cease-and-desist orders against Future Income Payments. Documents obtained by the FBI say that hundreds of sales agents received generous commission checks for setting up the deals, while the thousands of investors lost about $451 million.

Prior to Kohn’s ignoble seaside apprehension, Watkins claims there was an arrangement made for Kohn to turn himself in. After the deal fell through Kohn is believed to have used cash to stay at hotels and eat at IHOP. His Los Vegas estate and a house on Newport Beach have been sold."

Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s order was quickly approved by the state Public Health Council and applies to all vaping products and devices. The ban, though temporary, is broader than moves in at least two states, Michigan and New York, to ban only vape flavors.

His announcement came amid growing concern about the health effects of vaping products, including deaths.

The administration said that as of Tuesday, 61 cases of potential cases of lung disease related to the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping in Massachusetts had been reported to the state.

Three confirmed cases and two probable Massachusetts cases of vaping-associated pulmonary disease have been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The use of e-cigarettes and marijuana vaping products is exploding, and we are seeing reports of serious lung illnesses, particularly in our young people,” Baker said at a news conference at the Massachusetts Statehouse.

State health officials this month health began requiring the collection of data on potential cases of lung disease related to the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping in Massachusetts.

During the temporary ban, Baker said, the administration will work with medical experts and state and federal officials to better understand vaping illnesses and work on additional steps to address the public health crisis.

That, he said, could include legislation and regulations. The administration will also work on providing more resources for a public awareness campaign and smoking cessation programs, he said.

The CDC is investigating the outbreak but has not yet identified a common e-cigarette or ingredient. Nine deaths have been reported.

Dr. Anne Schuchat, of the CDC, told a congressional subcommittee Tuesday that she believes “hundreds more” lung illnesses have been reported to health authorities since Thursday, when the CDC put the tally at 530 confirmed and probable cases.

Michael Seilback, assistant vice president for state public policy at the American Lung Association, acknowledged the move by Massachusetts and said the federal Food and Drug Administration now needs to step up.

“From our perspective, it’s the absence of strong federal action by the FDA that is forcing states to have to make choices like this on how they are going to protect children and adults from the public health emergency of e-cigarettes,” he said.

Convenience store owners who rely on the foot traffic brought in by the sale of vaping products are going to be concerned by the decision, according to Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.

“There are clearly some issues there. The question is, what’s the problem? Is it the product being sold on the shelves by companies like Juul, or is it the off-brand stuff coming from other countries and sold on the internet?” Hurst said. “I hope we can all work together and find out what is the problem and find a solution soon.”

Democratic Massachusetts House Speaker Robert DeLeo said Tuesday that his legislative chamber is committed to addressing vaping and tobacco use among children.

The House is reviewing a bill that would ban the sale or distribution of any flavored tobacco or vape product to any consumer. The bill would carve out an exception for smoking bars.

“We look forward to collaborating with our partners in the senate and with the Baker administration to develop long-term, legislative solutions to these issues,” DeLeo said in a news release.

A lawmaker in Rhode Island also plans to introduce a bill to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in that state after the new legislative session begins in January."

Claims ‘Global Climate Leadership’ as Private Jet Use Soars by 50%,"The European Union (E.U.) is set to make a multi-million euro increase on funding private jet “taxis” for its officials, while also claiming to be a “global climate leader” demanding carbon emission cuts by 50 percent, if not 55 percent, by 2030.

Although the organization is still two years away from the current “air taxi” contract ending, it has decided to raise the amount that can be spent by officials to €10.71 million, a 50 percent increase on the starting amount, Politco reports.

The spending splurge comes despite new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledging to raise the E.U.’s 2030 emissions reduction target and set a 2050 climate neutrality goal.

In order to reach the 2050 target, von der Leyen urged cutting carbon emissions across Europe by 50 percent, if not 55 percent, by 2030.

“I want Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent in the world by 2050,” von der Leyen told the E.U. parliament in July, eliciting strong applause.

Von der Leyen told MEPs that, as part of a “Green Deal for Europe” in her first 100 days in office, she would push to enshrine the 2050 target in law with heavy penalties for member states that fail to hit their E.U. targets as directed by Brussels.

Whether or not private jet use by the E.U. is affected – if at all – remains to be seen.

The bloc’s original contract for private air travel said it was for the “provision of air-taxi transport services (chartered jet aeroplanes) for use by the President or other members of the European Commission, for the European Parliament Presidency, for the President of the European Council, for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and any accompanying persons, mostly in the European Union,” according to Politco.

This was for approximately 871 flight hours to destinations including Berlin, Stuttgart and Strasbourg.

But this was changed when a new notice said “analysis of expenditure during the period already elapsed has led to the conclusion that this threshold will not suffice to cover the needs of the European institutions until the expiry date of the contract i.e. 30.4.2021” .

However a commission spokesperson told Politico: “This does not mean that the total amount under the contract will be spent.

“The amended contract just provides a guarantee that the threshold will be sufficient to cover the needs of the E.U. institutions for the remaining period of the contract.”

Despite the E.U. drive for compliance with its harsh climate directives, there appears to be little resonance with citizens of member states.

The European Commission’s Eurobarometer survey, a twice-annually inquiry into the opinions of over 27,000 Europeans, asked people in 33 countries last month what their main concerns were for the European Union, and found worries over immigration to be the clear winner.

Breitbart News reported some 34 percent of Europeans surveyed said immigration was their top concern in 2019, putting the issue comfortably ahead of climate concerns that came in at just 22 percent of respondents’ worries."

While attempting to deliver the decision of the 2016 Brexit referendum, in which the British people gave the largest democratic mandate in the nation’s history in favour of leaving the European Union, the new Boris Johnson government has discovered it is unable to do so as Britain’s parliament is overwhelmingly in favour of the EU. Repeated defeats in the house and outside it, and laws passed compelling the Prime Minister to rule out no-deal Brexit have raised the spectre of a shadow government ruling the United Kingdom without actually taking official office.

In an effort to redress this imbalance which sees a coalition of opposition parties able to defeat the government in every vote, the Prime Minister has already attempted to call a general election twice, both of which have been rejected by the opposition. According to government sources speaking to British newspaper the Daily Telegraph in the wake of the government’s defeat at the Supreme Court, Mr Johnson will put an election forward to a Parliamentary vote for a third time, probably Thursday this week.

The unnamed source reportedly told the paper: “People should expect a quick push for an early election with a vote in Parliament in the coming days.”

Until recently, a government facing this level of difficulty in actually governing would have already collapsed and gone to the polls, but thanks to an ill-advised law meddling with the British constitution introduced by David Cameron and Nick Clegg, this is no longer the case. In fact, now a hamstrung government needs the permission of the opposition to call a general election, a constitutional anomaly in British history.

In normal times the opposition party would always accept the opportunity to challenge the government and win a general election, presumably believing their policies and beliefs would be more attractive to the British people than those of the party already in power.

Indeed, calls for the Prime Minister to resign by opposition parties have intensified since the Supreme Court ruling, yet the most democratic constitutional apparatus for making this happen — going to the country for a fresh election — has been repeatedly rejected by opposition parties, and it appears unlikely this will change on the third time of asking.

When asked, spokesmen for opposition parties insist they will not permit an election to take place until, in their words, “no deal has been taken off the table”, meaning they refuse to allow an election while it remains a possibility that the United Kingdom could make a full break from the European Union, as was decided in the 2016 referendum.

Why opposition parties acting so nakedly anti-democratically in attempting to stitch up an election by making one possible outcome — an outcome which repeated polling shows is popular with the British people — impossible is hardly challenged by the government or the mainstream media who largely seem to accept the behaviour as perfectly reasonable.

Because the anti-Brexit opposition is now able to dictate to the government, it makes little sense for them to allow an election they may believe they would lose, like turkeys voting for a political Christmas.

It is thought if Labour is able to prevent the Prime Minister from actually delivering Brexit as repeatedly promised on October 31st, they would then agree to a general election as it would likely see Mr Johnson at his weakest — having failed to keep his word and take the UK out on that already much-delayed date, Nigel Farage’s Brexit party would likely be surging in the polls.

My Corbyn may have calculated that with the Brexit Party eating into Tory majorities in pro-Brexit seats across England and Wales the right-wing vote would split, leaving him free to win the election at that stage. Mitigating this risk is Nigel Farage himself, who has made the Prime Minister a peace offering in the form of an electoral pact where Brexit and Tory candidates would not stand against one another inn selected seats.

The suggestion was subsequently rejected with apparent disgust by sources within the government who called Nigel Farage not a “fit and proper” person to be allowed near the levers of government.

The leader of the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), who faces a national election on Sunday, told German media that he had a “feeling” that the number of migrants crossing into Europe from Africa and the Middle East could once again be on the rise, Kronen Zeitung reports.

“Not only do I have the feeling that something is brewing. But I also have the feeling that we in Europe are partly to blame,” Kurz said.

Kurz slammed the new Italian leftist coalition government saying they had enacted a “reversal in migration policy” by opening the country’s ports to migrant transport NGOs.

This criticism was echoed last week by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó who argued that Europe was safer when populist leader Matteo Salvini occupied the post of interior minister due to his anti-mass migration policies.

Erdogan Threatens to ‘Open the Gates’ to Migrants Unless Turkey Receives Aid https://t.co/oczI9Ol37Q — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 7, 2019

According to Kurz, the open borders attitudes of the new Italian government send “very incorrect signals in the direction of Africa and in the direction of the people smugglers”.

In recent weeks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has also put pressure of the European Union to aid the building of housing along the Syrian border to accommodate Syrian refugees, threatening to unleash a wave of migrants into Greece if Europe does not contribute.

“If we go on his playing field, then we will pay more and more to him and he will increasingly have the impression that he has us in the palm of his hand,” Kurz said and added: “If people are rescued in the Mediterranean, we should do everything possible to put them back in their countries of origin.”

While Kurz and the ÖVP are expected to come first in Sunday’s snap election, many have speculated who their coalition partner or partners will be.

The populist Freedom Party, whose former leader resigned as a result of the Ibiza scandal that led to the fall of Kurz’s government, is also highly critical of allowing migrant transport NGOs to resume docking in Italy.

Former interior minister Herbert Kickl also slammed plans for an EU-wide migrant redistribution system saying: “The only signal in the right direction would be to rigorously ban NGO ships from docking in European ports and force them to bring people back to their base in North Africa.”

According to Kurz, the open borders attitudes of the new Italian government send “very incorrect signals in the direction of Africa and in the direction of the people smugglers”.

In recent weeks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has also put pressure of the European Union to aid the building of housing along the Syrian border to accommodate Syrian refugees, threatening to unleash a wave of migrants into Greece if Europe does not contribute.

“If we go on his playing field, then we will pay more and more to him and he will increasingly have the impression that he has us in the palm of his hand,” Kurz said and added: “If people are rescued in the Mediterranean, we should do everything possible to put them back in their countries of origin.”

While Kurz and the ÖVP are expected to come first in Sunday’s snap election, many have speculated who their coalition partner or partners will be.

The populist Freedom Party, whose former leader resigned as a result of the Ibiza scandal that led to the fall of Kurz’s government, is also highly critical of allowing migrant transport NGOs to resume docking in Italy.

Former interior minister Herbert Kickl also slammed plans for an EU-wide migrant redistribution system saying: “The only signal in the right direction would be to rigorously ban NGO ships from docking in European ports and force them to bring people back to their base in North Africa.”

Hill joined her colleagues earlier in the day in support of the measure, adding that Trump’s impeachment was not her objective when she ran for Congress. However, she acknowledged there was a risk in supporting impeachment for reelection chances for her and some of her colleagues.

“[I] think this administration and the information that’s come forth over the last several months since we’ve been here has pushed each of us further and further and further towards that question of at what point do we need to push this towards a full-on impeachment proceeding,” she said. “And I think this was finally the tipping point for so many of us.

Since July, polls have showed that at least half of American voters have opposed beginning impeachment or an impeachment inquiry. However, Democrats have decided that a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son for corruption related to his work in Ukraine was a tipping point.

Recent polls show that the testimony of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller in late July did not even persuade voters to change their opinions on impeachment. Democrats are betting that this latest issue will — but a look at previous polls is not promising for them.

Lance Gooden (R-TX) introduced legislation Tuesday to remove House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and end the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

Gooden’s legislation would formally recognize the illegality of Nadler’s impeachment proceedings and remove the New York Democrat as the committee chairman.

The Texas congressman contended that the Judiciary Committee must receive authorization to begin impeachment proceedings; however, the House denied Nadler authorization by overwhelmingly rejecting H.R. 498 in July. Nadler has continued to claim that he is “impeaching the president– right now.”

“In recent days Democrats have sanctimoniously declared their allegiance to the rule of law. I encourage them to follow those rules and hold Chairman Nadler accountable for breaking them,” Rep. Gooden said in a statement Tuesday.

Rep. Gooden’s resolution arises as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced Tuesday that she will hold a press conference later in the day on whether Democrats will move forward on a potential impeachment inquiry into the president.

The latest impeachment effort arose after a report found that President Trump reportedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in the eastern European country.

Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani has said that Biden, as vice president, worked to shield from investigation a Ukrainian gas company with ties to Hunter.

“By law, he may not launch impeachment proceedings until the full House votes for him to do so. This attempted coup against a duly-elected, sitting president is unprecedented and must be stopped,” Gooden added in his statement. “I urge the Majority to move immediately to have him stripped of his chairmanship and that any accomplices on the Judiciary Committee not be considered as a replacement.”"

Trump noted that the Democrats are focused on “hurting” him too:

Trump’s tweet comes as reports indicate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is expected to announce an impeachment inquiry.

Democrats have been pressing the Republican-controlled Senate to take up gun control legislation which the House passed months ago. Just weeks ago, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) even went so far as to ask Trump to lay down “political cover” so Republican Senators could support gun control measures.

Trump is now turning it back on the Democrats, suggesting nothing is being accomplished because they have abandoned their legislative priorities. In this case, those priorities included all the gun control legislation Democrats claimed to be pushing for the sake of public and school safety.

The massively funded Arabella Advisors strategy company, which uses a web of fronts to push the interests of wealthy leftist donors, has been quietly behind key activism seeking to allow the use of federal funds to pay for abortions.

Arabella Advisors is a centralized hub that runs nonprofit arms that in turn have spawned a nexus of hundreds of front organizations outwardly designed to appear grassroots but actually working against ordinary people by expanding government control in the lives of Americans.

Arabella’s vast network was unmasked in an extensive exposé by conservative watchdog Capital Research Center, which documents the shadowy system developed by, housed in and staffed by the for-profit, privately held Arabella Advisors.

The Arabella firm in turn manages four nonprofits: the New Venture Fund, Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, and Hopewell Fund. These nonprofit entities play host to hundreds of groups and projects that promote interests and political movements strategically deployed in a long-term campaign to nudge the country to the left.

Arabella’s New Venture Fund maintains a project calling itself All Above All, which advocates for Congress to overturn the Hyde Amendment, the 1976 legislative provision that bans the use of federal funds for abortions with the exception only of extreme cases.

In 2017, All Above All and the lobbying arm of Arabella’s Sixteen Thirty Fund got behind the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (“EACH Woman”) bill, which sought to “ensure abortion coverage and care through the federal government” in Medicaid and Medicare. The bill also would have stopped state legislatures from restricting abortion coverage as part of private health plans.

The New Venture Fund also sponsors the Women’s Equality Center, which helps create strategic messaging to market pro-abortion campaigns.

The Capital Research Center report further documented, “The Center, in turn, nominally manages Keep Birth Control Copay Free (both are in reality part of New Venture Fund), which lobbies the government to force private health insurers to provide copay-free birth control coverage.”

Arabella Advisors has been quietly behind a hydra-like dark money network of pop-up groups designed to look like grassroots activist organizations, Capital Research’s report reveals. These front groups push everything from opposition to President Trump’s proposed border wall to support for Obamacare to gun control to government control of the Internet to advocating for a liberal Supreme Court and other left-wing causes.

The inspector general’s report has, thus far, been withheld by the administration.

Democrats allege that the Trump administration is violating the law in keeping the report from Congress, which was the chief reason cited Tuesday by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for changing her mind and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

It is not clear why the administration had withheld the report, though the White House announced Tuesday that it will release the report Wednesday, along with the transcript of Trump’s conversation with the new president of Ukraine.

Henry, citing a “senior official” with first-hand knowledge of the inspector general’s report, said that the anonymous “whistleblower” — who did not hear Trump’s conversation directly — was biased in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 opponents, though the official did not say which one.

Henry also said the official had told him that there would be no “smoking gun” in the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — even though there would be “at least a few words” in it that would cause unspecified problems for the White House.

Hannity added that his sources had also told him that Trump and Zelensky had only briefly discussed the aborted investigation into a company on whose board Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, had served. Biden boasted last year that he had forced the Ukrainian prosecutor out by threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid.

The expected announcement comes as more than two-thirds of House Democrats now say they support impeachment in light of President Trump confirming that he suggested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky probe Hunter Biden during a congratulatory telephone call in July. Pelosi will reportedly announce the new inquiry after the Democratic caucus’ meeting at 4:00 p.m. EST.

Earlier Tuesday, President Trump said he ordered White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold tens of millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine a week before he telephoned Kiev’s leader.

Before making his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Tuesday, the president told reporters he gave the order because he felt other allied nations weren’t providing enough.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

While still at the United Nations, President Trump later announced that he would release the full transcript of his phone call with Zelensky.

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” the president tweeted.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!” he added.

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

Though numerous congressional Democrats are now demanding an impeachment inquiry to be opened due to the Trump-Zelensky call, it remains unclear if the president broke the law by asking for an inquiry to be made into the Biden family. Further, the alleged “whistleblower” who reportedly claims to possess knowledge of the president pressuring Zelensky, did not hear the pair’s conversation first hand.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham hit out at reports regarding Pelosi’s expected announcement, saying in a statement “the Democrats continue to weaponize politics when they should be working on behalf of their constituents, which is nothing new.”

“President Trump is working hard on behalf of our country here in NYC while they continue to scream the word impeachment. Nothing new here,” added Grisham.

UPDATE — 4:55 p.m. EST: According to Politico, Pelosi told Democrats during Tuesday’s caucus meeting: “It would be my intention with the consent of this caucus … to proceed with an impeachment inquiry. He is asking a foreign government to help him in his campaign, that is a betrayal of his oath of office.”

UPDATE — 5:07 p.m. EST: At a Capitol Hill press conference House Speaker Pelosi officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump: “The House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry. The President must be held accountable; no one is above the law,” she said.

Mike Lee’s (R-UT) effort to allow India and China to monopolize the United States’ green card system.

Lee’s S. 386 provides a massive giveaway to Big Tech corporations like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft — all of which are donors to the Utah Senator.

The legislation will ensure outsourcing firms such as Cognizant and Infosys, as well as giant tech conglomerates like Amazon and Facebook, have a green card system wherein employers would have to wait seven to eight years before securing an employment-based green card for a hire.

This process would solidify that employment-based green cards only go to temporary foreign visa workers, like those imported on the H-1B visa, thus rewarding those corporations who replace their American employees with H-1B foreign visa workers who are overwhelmingly Indian male nationals.

While about 25 percent of all employment-based green cards currently are rewarded to Indian nationals today, should Lee’s legislation pass, Indian nationals will obtain more than 90 percent of all the employment-based green cards for at least a decade.

Paying out lobbyists to push Republican and Democrat Senators into supporting Lee’s green card giveaway are tech corporations like Google, Microsoft, the Oracle Corporation, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. For instance, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard have sent out a combined total of 18 lobbyists to Capitol Hill to push Lee’s green card giveaway out to Senators.

At the same time, Microsoft has been Lee’s largest tech donor for the last five election cycles, doling out nearly $130,000 to him since 2015. More than $97,000 of those funds went directly to Lee while another $30,000 went to Lee’s PAC.

Likewise, Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. has donated $55,900 to Lee since 2015, while the Oracle Corporation has donated $44,200.

Others bankrolling Lee’s S. 386 are the Koch brothers’ network of organizations, such as Americans for Prosperity, the outsourcing lobby, like Cognizant and the IBM Corporation, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The Chamber of Commerce, for example, has almost 30 lobbyists working to push Lee’s green card giveaway, while Cognizant and IBM have a total of seven lobbyists pushing the legislation. IBM and Cognizant are set to gain hugely from S. 386, as they are two of the largest outsourcers of American jobs in the nation.

This year, alone, Cognizant sought to outsource more than 13,000 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers. IBM — headed by Ginni Rometty who takes in a salary of $16.45 million a year — attempted to outsource nearly 8,500 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers.

The Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity, which has deployed eight lobbyists to push Lee’s green card giveaway, has indirectly been a donor to Lee through the years. Since 2015, Lee has raked in nearly $60,000 from Koch Industries.

Lee’s S. 386 is also being lobbied for by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), which aids illegal aliens and foreign workers in their efforts to not be deported, has sent out three lobbyists to push the green card giveaway.

Though S. 386 was blocked by Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), Lee and Perdue are expected to make a deal on the legislation and hope to take fast-track a vote by the end of this week.

Students at Syracuse University that enroll in “African American Politics” may be in for a dose of leftist indoctrination. According to a report by Campus Reform, students in the course are required to purchase a copy of Michael Moore’s 2001 book, Stupid White Men, which focused primarily on criticisms of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.

But Stupid White Men isn’t simply a criticism of past presidents. As the title suggests, the book includes controversial statements about race. In one chapter, which is subtly titled “Kill Whitey,” Moore asks if all white people suffer from a “shared low-grade of mental illness?”

“Are white people’s brains hardwired to see one thing but believe the opposite because of race?” Moore writes. “Do all white people suffer from some shared low-grade of mental illness?”

One Syracuse student told Campus Reform that it is difficult for conservative students to challenge liberal professors in the classroom.

“You’re telling me you’ve never had a conservative kid walk into that classroom? I guarantee there is another student in there who wasn’t comfortable confronting him,” the student said.

Breitbart News reported earlier this month on a survey that revealed that 73 percent of conservative students self-censor in the classroom. One student that was interviewed claimed that his peer received a poor grade on a paper because he chose to argue in favor of a border wall.

“When writing papers for gen ed classes? Absolutely. I know a guy who chose to write a pro-border wall argumentative essay for our super liberal professor and the prof just wrote, ‘this whole paper is one big fallacy’ and bombed him,” one student said. “Me? I wrote about the evils of horse racing. Perfectly safe topic.”"
1025,,http://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/09/24/nolte-rambo-last-blood-is-more-proof-you-cant-trust-rotten-tomatoes/,2019-09-24T00:00:00,Nolte: ‘Rambo: Last Blood’ Is More Proof You Can’t Trust Rotten Tomatoes,"Only 28 percent of critics gave Sylvester Stallone’s Rambo: Last Blood a fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes, compared to 84 percent of the audience.

And once again, as was the case with comedian Dave Chappelle’s latest Netflix special (35% compared to 99%) and Jennifer Garner’s Peppermint (17% compared to 72%), we see just how out of touch the Critical Class is with everyday moviegoers. Chappelle brilliantly mocked Woke Fascists and Peppermint was basically about one of President Trump’s Angel Moms getting revenge on the MS-13 gang that slaughtered her family. Gee, you think that had something to do with it?

If that’s not proof enough of a vast divide, look at the 100 percent to 17 percent disparity between the Critical Class and everyday moviegoers for Netflix’s Knock Down the House, an adoring look at the avowed socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy (D-NY). Every single critic who review it adored it. Real people not so much.

How about the 39 percent to 93 percent chasm for Angel has Fallen, the latest chapter in the Fallen franchise featuring Gerard Butler’s Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, which mocks the Russia Collusion Hoax.

Overcomer, another one of those “unexpected” Christian-themed hits at the box office ($32 million and counting), has a gap of 50 percent to 98 percent. For added lulz, Overcomer, which features no stars and had no studio-backed promotional campaign, trounced all the Woke fare, such as Stuber, Booksmart, Late Night, The Kitchen, and Longshot, at the box office.

The problem here is cultural and political. The elite Critical Class have a massive diversity problem, and I am of course talking about intellectual and cultural diversity.

A good example of this is last year’s The First Purge, which earned praise from 54 percent of critics (nearly twice Rambo’s percentage) when it’s objectively a huge disappointment — a preachy piece of snore. I happen to be a fan of the Purge franchise, but The First Purge is a crushing disappointment. It’s not only dull, but what had been a thematically-driven franchise decided to get overtly political (read: left-wing) and preachy (read: self-important), which took all of the fun out of the series.

I don’t have anything against left-wing movies per se, if they are well made. The First Purge is just terrible.

But it was The First Purge’s left-wing preaching, it’s Wokeness, that hit the Critical Class’s political sweet spot, so a whole lot of them gave an objective piece of garbage a passing grade … while only 28 percent of everyday moviegoers did the same.

By any objective measure — pacing, structure, story, acting — Rambo: Last Blood is a much better movie than The Last Purge, but critics are furious at Stallone for raising awareness about the horrific cost of our opens borders, how it enables Mexican cartels and gangs to enslave Mexican girls; so strictly for partisan purposes, they smear it as racist and claim it sucks. Believe me, it doesn’t suck. It’s no classic, but it hits the mark with satisfaction to spare. This is one of those movies that’s going to rerun forever on cable TV. It also opened to a perfectly respectable $19 million.

You don’t expect every critic to line up with the audience. I pan blockbusters all the time (never for political reasons). But there is an obvious pattern here, and one that proves everyday moviegoers cannot trust Rotten Tomatoes, especially if you are anything close to right-of-center culturally or politically.

Rotten Tomatoes and its cabal of left-wing critics are deliberately looking to deceive us and even tag us as racist for daring to enjoy a perfectly acceptable piece of entertainment.

The more insidious goal of these critics falls under the umbrella of blacklisting. These partisan attacks are obviously geared towards ensuring that any movie that explores truths inconvenient to the left, will take a media-beating designed to hurt its chances at the box office and tar the creators as racists.

These reviews are meant to have a chilling effect on artistic freedom and expression.

P.S. I’ll admit to being a minuscule part of the problem. I could probably join Rotten Tomatoes as a reviewer; but I’m not a big fan of joining, and one person is not going to make any real difference.

According to a report by The College Fix, a federal judge has ruled that Christian students at Wayne State University can move forward with their lawsuit against the university over its policy that requires them to allow non-Christian students to hold leadership positions in their Christian group.

The organization, the Wayne State chapter of InterVarsity, was shut down by the public Wayne State University over allegations that the organization’s policies on non-Christian student leaders were discriminatory.

In the fall of 2017, the university revoked the chapter’s official recognition and canceled all of its scheduled meetings. The penalty was imposed upon the group as a punishment for the group’s internal policy that non-Christians could not serve in leadership positions.

United States District Judge Robert H. Cleland published an opinion denying Wayne State University’s motion for summary judgment, arguing that the student organization had sufficiently established that they deserve the chance to argue that their First Amendment rights were violated by the university’s policy.

“Under the First Amendment, ‘the ability of like-minded individuals to associate for the purpose of expressing commonly held views may not be curtailed,'” Cleland wrote in the opinion, citing a First Amendment case from 2012.

Greg Jao, the Director of External Relations at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA, said that he is glad the court is allowing the organization to move forward with their lawsuit.

“We’re pleased that the court is allowing our case to go forward,” Jao said. “InterVarsity just wants to continue serving the campus and local community. All religious students should have the right to come together for worship and service according to their religious identity without being targeted for their faith.”

Breitbart News reported in May 2019 that Christian students at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, won a similar lawsuit against their university. The university refused to grant the Christian student organization official university recognition because they refused to comply with a policy that required them to open club leadership positions to non-Christians.

“It would be absurd for the university to require the vegan student group to appoint a meat-lover as its president,” the attorney for the students said at the time. “Thankfully, the university has acknowledged its error and announced a policy that respects students’ rights to free association, no longer forcing Christian students to let atheists or other non-Christians to lead their Bible studies in order to become a registered club.”

The employee deleted computer code from the company’s systems, impacting its ability to support its customers.

According to a blog post from the company, the employee’s decision to remove the computer code had an impact on “production systems for a number of our customers,” according to Chef, and led the company to deploy its “entire team” to “minimize customer downtime and will continue to do so until we restore services to 100% operation.”

Despite the disruption to its service caused by the rogue employee, Chef has decided to pay the dane-geld. It has cut ties with ICE, ending a business relationship that began during the Obama administration.

Not only did Chef’s CEO, Barry Crist, cave in to intimidation tactics, he actually apologized to the mob. In a blog post Monday, Crist wrote:

While I and others privately opposed this and various other related policies, we did not take a position despite the recommendation of many of our employees. I apologize for this. I had hoped that traditional political checks and balances would provide remedy and that our relationship with our various government customers could avoid getting intermingled with these policies. However, it is clear that checks and balances have not provided relief to the fundamental issues of the policies in question. Chef, as well as other companies, can take stronger positions against these policies that violate basic human rights. Over the past year, many of our employees have constructively advocated for a change in our position, and I want to thank them. After deep introspection and dialog within Chef, we will not renew our current contracts with ICE and CBP when they expire over the next year.

The tactic of bullying corporations into line with the progressive political agenda continues to gain traction on the left. Chef caving to the threat of sabotage is another example.

The social network said on Friday that it had removed “tens of thousands” of apps over concerns that they may have inappropriately accessed the personal data of its users.

In an update posted on its official blog, Facebook said it utilized the services of “hundreds of people: attorneys, external investigators, data scientists, engineers, policy specialists, platform partners, and other teams across the company” to investigate the use of personal data by third parties following the Cambridge Analytica story.

“To date, this investigation has addressed millions of apps. Of those, tens of thousands have been suspended for a variety of reasons while we continue to investigate,” wrote Facebook.

Facebook tried to downplay the mass suspensions, emphasizing that the suspended apps were associated with a small number of developers and that many were inactive:

It is important to understand that the apps that have been suspended are associated with about 400 developers. This is not necessarily an indication that these apps were posing a threat to people. Many were not live but were still in their testing phase when we suspended them. It is not unusual for developers to have multiple test apps that never get rolled out. And in many cases, the developers did not respond to our request for information so we suspended them, honoring our commitment to take action .

The social network, which boasts over 2 billion users worldwide, was recently challenged by Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) to submit to a third-party audit on political bias, and to sell WhatsApp and Instagram to address competition concerns. According to Hawley, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said no to both.

Almasi: Jerome Hudson Exposes the Left in ’50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know’,"While it is increasingly difficult to find straws in American restaurants due to pressure from environmental activists, 90 percent of the plastic waste polluting our planet comes from Asia and Africa. As the Trump Administration fights to build a border wall along our southern border, there are no complaints about bigotry or xenophobia for our subsidizing of border walls for countries such as Jordan and Israel. Almost every American mass shooting over the last 70 years happened in a “gun-free zone.”

These are just three of the secrets Jerome Hudson reveals in his eye-opening and highly readable new book, 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know. Hudson is quite successful in achieving the goal that his book “blows up and disproves some of the political left’s most treasured beliefs.”

The entertainment editor for Breitbart News and a member of the Project 21 black leadership network, Hudson approached writing 50 Things to show others what he came to realize during his own political awakening — that the political establishment and celebrity elite are “weaponizing emotion at the expense of facts and data that don’t yield the politically correct conclusions they desire.”

“I swallowed whole their carefully crafted narratives without objection,” Hudson admitted. And it was through years of critical research, in which he found fault with things that both liberals and conservatives were saying, that he eventually found a home in the new media environment created by Andrew Breitbart and others.

Having successfully made the transition, Hudson now wants to share what he learned along the way.

One secret that Hudson busts open is about carbon emissions attributed to climate change. The Trump Administration was roundly criticized for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord, which National Center for Public Policy Research President David A. Ridenour said would cause a “wrenching transformation of our economy,” destroying millions of American jobs yet “accomplish next to nothing.” Despite the pullout, and without media fanfare, Hudson reported, America reduced its carbon emissions by a half-percent in 2017 — leading the rest of the world for the ninth time in the past 17 years.

This achievement occurred without adherence to the Paris accord or the need for federal regulation like the “cap-and-trade” scheme attempted in the Obama era. And, like the plastic problem, Hudson noted that governments that are still Paris accord signatories — and critical of the U.S. pullout — are grossly behind in meeting their goals. China, Iran and even the European Union logged increased carbon emissions as the United States posted its decline.

Hudson also targeted the “fact-checkers” employed by social media companies for their bias. And he showed how they are often wrong. He wrote about how Snopes, which was dismissed as a fact-checker for Facebook, he wrote, hired fact-checkers who previous worked for the left- wing Raw Story and “openly espoused their left-wing views.” Snopes once went as far as to debunk a Babylon Bee satire that joked that CNN for buying a washing machine “to spin news before publication.” Snopes may not have gotten the humor, but a “false” rating for the Babylon Bee at that time could have diminished its ability to market its work and make money from it.

To ensure such criticism cannot be leveled against him, Hudson’s 50 Things is packed with facts. Over 13 percent of the book is endnotes that cite government-compiled statistics as well as legacy media and new media reports. This is the kind of attribution you cannot find in mainstream media reporting, and one of the reasons for the success of the new media in which Hudson now works.

While sobering – and sometimes downright scary – Jerome Hudson’s 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know is a fast-paced, informative read that people won’t want to put down. And, as it gets closer to the holiday season, this book is something readers should also arm themselves with as they get ready for increasingly political Thanksgiving and Christmas family get-togethers.

The tech giant said it had paused the process of human transcription of Google Assistant voice records, and announced a number of new measures.

Via Google’s official blog:

Recently we’ve heard concerns about our process in which language experts can listen to and transcribe audio data from the Google Assistant to help improve speech technology for different languages. It’s clear that we fell short of our high standards in making it easy for you to understand how your data is used, and we apologize. When we learned about these concerns, we immediately paused this process of human transcription globally to investigate, and conducted a full review of our systems and controls.

Google isn’t getting rid of human voice transcription altogether, though — it’s just promising to be more transparent about it.

We’re updating our settings to highlight that when you turn on VAA, human reviewers may listen to your audio snippets to help improve speech technology. If you’re an existing Assistant user, you’ll have the option to review your VAA setting and confirm your preference before any human review process resumes. We won’t include your audio in the human review process unless you’ve re-confirmed your VAA setting as on.

Google’s announcement comes days after a child protection organization sent a letter to U.S. senators asking them to investigate Google’s use of contractors to analyze recordings of users, among other privacy scandals involving big tech companies.

General Assembly on Tuesday for helping to solve many of the world’s problems and said its “efforts toward peace are coming to fruition,” notably including on the Korean Peninsula.

Moon’s assessment of the peace process was extremely positive, culminating in a proposal to transform the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas into a U.N. World Heritage Site.

“The U.N. and the Korean peninsula share the same goal of sustaining peace,” Moon said.

“The world is joining forces to help each other in disaster and emergency-relief cooperation, as well as in peacekeeping efforts,” he said. “The U.N. must continue to play a central role in fostering cooperation within the international community.”

Moon recalled how his Republic of Korea was liberated from Japanese occupation in the same year as the inception of the United Nations, and was able to “overcome the scourge of war with the assistance of the U.N. and the international community.” He pledged Korea would continue working to bring peace and prosperity to the Pacific region.

After this upbeat preamble, Moon offered an optimistic prognosis for negotiations with North Korea, looking forward to the next steps in an ongoing peace process he saw as beginning with the U.N.-approved suspension of a joint military exercise between the U.S. and South Korea in 2018 and North Korea’s visit to the Winter Olympics.

“Decisions made by President Trump and Chairman Kim provided the momentum behind a dramatic change in the situation on the Korean Peninsula,” he said, referring to the American and North Korean heads of state, respectively.

“Compared to the past, in which it took only a few rounds of gunfire to instigate major political unrest, the Korean Peninsula has undergone a distinct change. The negotiating table for peace on the Korean Peninsula remains accessible. The two Koreas and the U.S. are setting their sights not only on denuclearization and peace, but also on economic cooperation that will follow thereafter,” he said.

“The Republic of Korea intends to create a peace economy whereby peace can lead to economic cooperation, which in turn will reinforce a virtuous cycle,” Moon said, citing the example of European development in the peace that followed World War Two.

“We will continue dialogue with North Korea, and we’ll find and make a way toward complete denuclearization and permanent peace while maintaining cooperation with U.N. member states,” he pledged.

Moon said that peace “can only be created through dialogue” and must be underpinned with “agreements and law.”

“Only peace that has been accomplished on the basis of trust will last,” he said. “Over the past year and a half, dialogue and negotiations have produced significant results on the Korean Peninsula. Panmunjom, which used to be a symbol of division, has now become a demilitarized area where not even a single pistol exists. The two Koreas withdrew guard posts inside the DMZ, thereby transforming the very symbol of confrontation into a peace zone.”

Moon stressed that, despite a few diplomatic setbacks, no serious confrontation has occurred on the Korean Peninsula since the current peace process began, a marked improvement over previous attempts to reduce tensions in the region. He praised North Korea for helping to repatriate Korean War remains from various nations, including his own and the United States.

“These efforts have made it possible for President Trump to become the first sitting American president to cross the military demarcation line and set foot on North Korean soil,” Moon noted.

“The easing military tensions and solid trust among the leaders of both Koreas and the U.S. set the stage for a momentous trilateral meeting at Panmunjom. President Trump’s action in taking Chairman Kim’s hand and stepping over the military demarcation was, in itself, a declaration of the true beginning of a new era of peace. It was a remarkable step that will go down in the history of peace on the Korean Peninsula and in northeast Asia,” he said.

“I hope both leaders will take yet another huge step from there,” Moon said.

Noting that the Korean War has not technically ended, Moon hoped “the tragedy of war” would not be repeated on the Korean Peninsula and called for the long-running armistice to be replaced by a permanent peace treaty. He offered security guarantees to North Korea and hoped it would reciprocate, making it possible to “accelerate denuclearization and the development of a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.”

“At the very least, all hostile acts must be put on hold while the dialogue is ongoing,” he said.

Moon said lasting peace between the Koreas could only be achieved through cultural and economic exchange, suggesting that rising mutual prosperity would eliminate the rationale for conflict.

“A peace economy in which the two Koreas take part will solidify peace on the peninsula, and at the same time contribute to economic development in east Asia and the whole world,” he anticipated.

Moon proposed to the U.N. General Assembly the idea of transforming the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas into an “international peace zone,” creating a 250-kilometer-wide “pristine ecological treasure trove” of largely undeveloped land and a collection of historic landmarks that could become a “common heritage of humankind.”

“Once peace is established between the two Koreas, I will work together with North Korea to inscribe the DMZ as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,” he pledged, anticipating joint development between both Koreas and countries around the world to explore the region’s “ecology and culture,” and suggesting the United Nations could relocate its Korean offices to the former DMZ.

Moon noted the work of clearing mines from the DMZ is expected to take about 15 years, but U.N. participation in the effort could instantly turn the zone into an area of international cooperation and provide North Korea with the sort of reliable, highly visible security buffer it needs to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons.

“Chairman Kim Jong-un and I agreed on the peaceful use of the DMZ,” he revealed, adding that North Korea has taken steps to improve its railroads and other infrastructure so it can begin interfacing with the South Korean economy, the proposed DMZ peace area, and the rest of east Asia.

Moon concluded by effusively praising the role of “free and fair trade” in helping east Asia emerge from the shadow of colonialism, which might be taken as a single raindrop falling from the soaring heights of his sunny address and landing somewhere in the vicinity of Tokyo.

While he did not rebuke Japan specifically, Moon’s remarks clearly implied Japan’s current trade dispute and long-simmering feud with South Korea over World War Two and its aftermath are not helpful to the South Korean president’s vision of regional peace and enthusiastic cooperation."

The Global Times prodded climate change partisans to avoid street demonstrations like the one they held in Washington, DC, on Monday.

“Climate activists” staged a “ShutDownDC” protest on Monday, blocking several major intersections and causing enormous traffic jams. This was preceded by “FridaysforFuture” street actions in numerous countries patterned after teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg’s call for schoolchildren to go on “strike” by skipping classes.

The response from the Global Times was a mild rebuke that did not directly reference the D.C. protest or linger on the similarities between these protests and those held in Hong Kong against Beijing’s rule. Blocked intersections and school strikes are tactics employed by the Hong Kong protesters as well.

The Global Times was generally supportive of climate change activists but prodded them to avoid the tactics used by democracy activists, who the Chinese are working very hard to portray as out-of-control rioters:

Millions of climate activists in 156 countries and regions reportedly participated in the Fridays for Future street demonstrations on Friday, demanding the international society to take more actions to deal with global climate change. However, not engaging in protests doesn’t mean that Chinese people don’t care or support climate protection. On the contrary, according to a 2017 survey issued by the China Center for Climate Change Communication, an institute focusing on climate, 94 percent of respondents supported China’s implementation of the Paris Agreement and 96.8 percent supported the Chinese government to participate in international cooperation on climate change. The ratios are higher than those of almost all other countries. Such misunderstanding also shows that the logic of Westerners’ mentality is flawed. Is occupying streets the only way for people to express their appeals? Can such demonstrations really solve environmental problems? When people from the West encounter social problems, they first organize protests, through which they hope the problems could be solved. But the key to whether the problems can be solved and how the problems will be handled lies in how their governments pay attention to and respond to people’s demands. In this respect, the Chinese government is at the forefront of the world.

The Chinese Communist Party’s response to climate action protests against China would be fascinating, and probably very unpleasant for the activists. Fortunately, neither the Chinese Communists nor the activists have anything to worry about, because despite the Chinese being the worst polluters on the planet — with plans to get even worse, not better, over the next few decades — the climate change movement has very little interest in criticizing them.

Visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison needled the Chinese a bit on Monday by implying Beijing should do more to address “important global environmental challenges” in a more transparent manner, but that’s about as rough as it gets for the coal-and-CFC-loving Chinese. No one is trying to drop any $10 trillion “Green New Deal” bombs on Beijing.

After praising China for its supposedly great strides against pollution and touting environmental awards given to Chinese companies, the Global Times claimed China does not have mass protests because Beijing’s brilliant central planners do everything right without needing to be prodded by activists:

China’s achievements in environmental protection originate from the country’s very strong system, which determines how the Chinese leadership’s attention to the issue is effectively turned into pragmatic actions. We don’t think it is right for a government to take action only when there are demonstrations. Some environmental demonstrations took place in China in the past few years. They didn’t last long as people’s appeals were properly met. The Chinese government provides various channels for people to submit their demands and suggestions, which are often quickly addressed. Having such an effective mechanism, people don’t need to crowd into the streets to pressure the government.

This was probably meant as a vague allusion to the protests that gripped several Chinese cities with questionable plans for managing industrial growth, such as dumping giant garbage incinerators in the middle of residential neighborhoods."
1034,,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2019/09/24/china-warns-u-n-to-ignore-u-s-condemnation-of-muslim-concentration-camps/,2019-09-24T00:00:00,China Warns U.N. to Ignore U.S. on Muslim Concentration Camps,"China’s Global Times, a government-run publication, published a screed in anticipation of Tuesday’s U.N. General Assembly condemning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as an “arrogant interventionist” for urging the world to pressure China to shut down its concentration camps for Muslims.

The Chinese Communist Party has built thousands of concentration camps for ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz nationals who adhere to the Islamic faith where they face indoctrination, torture, slave labor, death, and potentially live organ harvesting. The U.S. government has estimated that between 1 and 3 million people are currently languishing in a Chinese concentration camp. Beijing insists the camps are “vocational training centers” where prisoners learn to worship the Communist Party, a valuable skill in the Chinese economy.

Pompeo addressed the situation in a meeting anticipating the General Assembly’s general debate on Tuesday. Ambassador-at-large for religious freedom Sam Brownback also condemned China in a separate event on freedom of worship and urged Islamic states, in particular, to speak up for their fellow believers against an increasingly belligerent China.

“The U.N. General Assembly is held in New York, and thus U.S. political elite like Pompeo think the general assembly would agree to whatever the U.S. says,” the Global Times complained. “Washington’s elite arrogantly declare that their human rights concept is universal. They do not admit that conflicts between their human rights concept and the diverse reality have created destructive side effects.”

“When Pompeo spoke on the Xinjiang question, most people saw him as a Western centralist and an arrogant interventionist,” the Times declared.

Acknowledging that the United Nations would not be able to exist without America – “The U.S. has provided the venue for the U.N. and is the largest financial contributor to the U.N.” – the Chinese propaganda outlet nonetheless insisted that “the U.N. does not owe the U.S. anything.”

“The U.S. could ask the U.N. to move out of the country if Washington feels wronged,” the Global Times derisively suggested.

Instead of discussing what is arguably the single worst crime against humanity currently underway, the Global Times suggests that the world use the General Assembly to condemn America for damaging the environment.

“The US should be blamed during this year’s general assembly because it has been jeopardizing the globe’s actions on climate change,” the Times argued. “Washington should not use the Xinjiang question to distract the attention of the international community.”

China is the world’s worst polluter and has worked to increase carbon emissions; China is not expected to reduce emissions until at least 2030.

During a meeting with Central Asian leaders on Sunday, Pompeo took a moment to condemn China’s alleged war on terror in Xinjiang, which it uses to excuse the concentration camps.

“I want to make clear that China’s repressive campaign in Xinjiang is not about terrorism,” Pompeo said. “It’s about China’s attempt – about China’s attempt to erase its own citizens’ Muslim faith and culture. We call on all countries to resist China’s demands to repatriate Uighurs.”

At a United Nations event on religious freedom the next day, Pompeo gave the stage to Jewher Ilham – whose father, a Uighur scholar, has been imprisoned in China for years under the charges of “separatism.” In a rare example of China bothering to issue a legal sentencing, Ilham Tohti, Ilham’s father, was sentenced to life in prison for his anti-communist advocacy.

“It has become a crime to be Uighur in China,” Ilham explained at the State Department event. “The Chinese Government targets religion to ensure that people of faith do not answer to any greater power than the Communist Party. In China, authorities have defaced or demolished churches, temples, and mosques throughout the country. Crosses and minarets have been replaced with hammers and sickles.”

“Beijing believes Islam is a sickness to be treated with an iron fist. Uighurs are detained for praying to God, fasting during Ramadan, wearing a beard, or simply saying as-salamu alaykum,” Ilham continued. “Every day, millions of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in China are being abused, drugged, and indoctrinated in the government’s concentration camps. Outside of these camps, they’re monitored and tracked using high-tech surveillance.”

In his event this week, Ambassador Brownback noted that many Islamic countries that benefit from business with China have been silent about the Communist Party’s repression of China’s Muslim minority.

“I’m very disappointed that a number of nations have signed a letter saying that what the Chinese are doing with the Uighurs is fine,” Brownback said. “I’m stunned, because you’ve got a million people in concentration camps in 2019 and you’re not concerned about this?”

Nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which heavily depend on Chinese business, have not condemned Beijing for human rights abuses against Muslims.

Seoul Gangseo Police Station confirmed that they had booked a gynecologist and a nurse for carrying out an abortion on a six-week pregnant woman after failing to check the patient’s medical information before undertaking the operation. The alleged victim, a Vietnamese national, reportedly entered the hospital for a separate treatment but ended up in a delivery room, where the doctors give injections and perform surgeries.

Having failed to properly check her identity, they ended up confusing her for a woman who was scheduled to receive an abortion and consequently anesthetized her before terminating her pregnancy. The patient returned to the hospital the following day after experiencing bloody discharge, where she was told that her child had been aborted.

Both the gynecologist and the accompanying nurse were later charged with professional negligence over their failure to confirm the patient’s identity before proceeding with the operation.

Police initially considered charges of abortion without consent, although they concluded that the two suspects could not be arrested on such charges as the victim was not aware that she was having an abortion, meaning she could not have consented to nor rejected the procedure.

A nationwide ban on abortion was imposed in South Korea in 1953, although the country’s supreme court ordered in April that the law must be revised by the end of 2020, deeming the current ban as unconstitutional. The case was brought to the court after a legal challenge was launched by a doctor prosecuted for carrying out nearly 70 abortions.

Under the 1953 ban, both women and doctors carrying out abortions can face even fines or imprisonment, although cases of rape, incest, or risk to their health are exempt. Despite this, approximately 50,000 abortions were carried out in the country in the year 2017.

According to a government survey carried out this year, approximately eight out of ten South Korean women said they did not believe the procedure should be criminalized.

The two Koreas have been officially at war for 70 years; China and the United States are also at war by proxy. The opposing sides of the Korean War signed an armistice agreement in 1953 – which stopped active hostilities – but no peace treaty exists.

The latest propaganda broadside against Washington comes on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly’s general debate, an open platform for world leaders to address their peers about whatever they want. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has never attended, but his foreign ministry or other diplomats typically use the occasion to condemn the United States for seeking an end to the communist regime’s illegal nuclear weapons development.

Meari – NK News, an online outlet that monitors North Korea, explained – is an online publication run by Pyongyang and targeting Koreans outside of the country, meaning its message is not meant to sway the average North Korean citizen. In an article titled “The Tyranny of Robbers Continues – American Involvement in Our Internal Affairs Has Led to a Violent Violation of National Dignity and Interests,” the publication complained that American negotiators insisted on discussing reunification of the Korean peninsula in the same talks as those on denuclearization.

North Korea does not recognize South Korea as a sovereign nation; instead, it views the south as a rogue province of a full communist Korea. Attempting to build diplomatic ties between North and South, then, is tantamount to meddling in “domestic” affairs, Meari argued.

Discussing reunification and denuclearization together “is no less than declaring that North-South relations cannot move forward without their ‘approval,’ the column says of the United States.

“What is it that the US is trying to get from the internal problems of our people?” the outlet asked, before accusing America of having a “bloody history of constant invasion and territorial expansion.” It then went on to attack America as a nation too young to have a say in the affairs of Korea, “which has a long history and culture of five millennia.”

“The U.S., which was only born two hundreds and scores of years ago, dares to argue against the country with a history of five thousand years … And it only becomes an intolerable insult to our nation,” Meari continued.

“No one ever asked the United States to help with the reconciliation, unity, peace, and unification of our people,” the publication insisted.

American and South Korean officials scheduled to meet to discuss North Korea and their own bilateral relationship in New York on Monday, where leftist South Korean President Moon Jae-in landed Sunday to attend this week’s U.N. General Assembly general debate. Moon and Trump are reportedly to discuss how to come to concrete agreements on ending the nuclear program in the north.

JoongAng Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, described South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha as positive and telling reporters that the Trump administration would take into consideration dictator Kim’s demands for “security,” meaning the continued existence of his corrupt communist regime and the indefinite continuation of gross human rights abuses against the North Korean people.

“Since the Hanoi summit, the North has increasingly made demands for security guarantees through various talks,” Kang reportedly added. “So we are cooperating with the United States to analyze what the North’s vision for a security guarantee is and what underlying intentions are carried in the North’s public statements.

South Korea’s Yonhap news agency noted that Kang told reporters Sunday that Seoul is prioritizing the creation of a concrete plan for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program.

“I think the biggest task in the working-level negotiations is to create a road map,” Kang said, a particularly difficult task given that neither side agrees on how to define denuclearization. “We do not have a specific and agreed definition of what final, fully verified denuclearisation or comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation – whatever your preferred term of art – is,” Stephen Biegun, the U.S. State Department special representative on North Korea, admitted early this year. There is no evidence either side has made any public that the two have managed to bridge the gap. The United States defines denuclearization as an end to North Korea’s illegal nuclear program. North Korea defines denuclearization as the full dismantlement of the American military presence in Korea, arguing that the peninsula is “nuclearized” because the U.S., a nuclear power, is present there.

“They need to restore trust in each other. It is hard to build trust while maintaining a hostile policy,” South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul said of the two sides on Monday, admitting it would “not be all that easy” to make progress in negotiations.

Some reports indicate that North Korean officials at the U.N. General Assembly will engage in dialogue with their American counterparts. If so, that in itself would be a victory for Washington – Kim’s regime had insisted this year that it would have no communication with Washington until President Donald Trump fired “diehard toxin” Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state."

The Global Times expected Canadians to cast their votes in the fall election based on numerous factors, so Trudeau’s goose is not yet cooked, but he could use the kind of polling surge that would come with an achievement like restoring Canada-China relations:

Political parties and media will focus on financial deficit, carbon tax, debates over oil pipelines and the SNC-Lavalin affair – a political scandal and controversy in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accused of political interference with the justice system. They will also pay attention to the various diplomatic mistakes and dilemma of the Trudeau administration. Besides, the case of Meng Wanzhou, Chinese tech giant Huawei’s chief financial officer, which has dented Canada-China relations, will also be the subject of heated debates. Voters are likely to get more information about all the aforesaid topics before heading to the polls. This will add to the uncertainty.

The Chinese Communist paper offered a golf clap for Trudeau’s ability to skate out of the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal without suffering a “heavy blow” to his approval ratings, then advised him to burnish his weak diplomatic credentials by pleasing Beijing with Meng’s release:

Some people think the Trudeau administration’s foreign policy is acceptable even though opposition parties denounce moves that affect trade ties with China. Moreover, international affairs that concern most Canadians are mainly related to climate and poverty governance. They wish their government could help Canada establish a positive image on the international stage in those regards, which is exactly what Trudeau is good at, compared to handling bilateral relations. If Trudeau is reelected, Canada-China ties would offer him a good opportunity to improve his diplomatic skills. In the wake of Canada’s detention of Meng in December 2018, more than half of Canadians stood by the move, showed a poll in January. However, a poll by Nanos Research in August demonstrated that only one in four say the Canadian government has done a good (20 percent) or very good (5 percent) job in handling the Meng issue.

Meng was back in court on Monday, presenting an argument that she was improperly arrested at the Vancouver airport in December and accusing the United States of “attempting to use these extradition proceedings for economic and political gain.”

The lawyers argued that U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments in December about Meng’s arrest provide “important context to what occurred” — namely, that Trump allegedly asked Canada to arrest Meng so she could become a bargaining chip in the U.S. trade war with China.

Meng’s defense team asked the court for access to documents that would show communications between the Canadian justice system and U.S. Justice Department around the time of her arrest. The initial response from the court was suspicion that Meng’s civil lawsuit against Canadian immigration officials is “just a ruse to get information for the extradition proceedings.”"

A renowned 73-year-old activist, one of the “grandpa protesters” who have put themselves on the front lines so that young people will not be harmed, was pepper-sprayed into submission by the police.

The grandpa protesters encourage young demonstrators to remain peaceful, but their advice is not always heeded. The more extreme wing of the youth protest movement, which tends to become active after dark, believes violence and vandalism are necessary to capture and hold the attention of Hong Kong’s government.

The authorities, in turn, characterize the entire movement as lawless and violent. The police have been criticized for using the destructive acts of extreme protesters to justify harsh actions against the entire movement.

A group called the Protect Our Kids Campaign that works with the grandpa protesters claimed police brutality when one of its yellow-vest-clad members was surrounded by dozens of riot police and beaten.

The police them moved to interfere with a bystander who was trying to record video of the beating by shining powerful flashlights into the camera, calling her a “cockroach,” and threatening to arrest her:

“We are infuriated by this incident of police brutality. Our member did not resist arrest nor in any way attack the police,” said Protect Our Kids member Roy Chan.

We have contacted our member’s legal representative, and learned that his gums and teeth are bleeding and that he is experiencing dizziness,” Chan added.

Chan, a preacher, compared the videotaped beating to a similar incident during the 2014 democracy protests and said the police have “not only deepened the cleavage between police and citizens, but also aroused the wrath of God.” He called upon the police to “repent their evil deeds.”

A police official responded by attempting to dismiss the video as merely depicting police kicking a “yellow object” of indeterminate origin, a tactic that did not go far with reporters who pointed out the “object” was clearly a human being. The official then claimed some other video footage exists that will prove the police did not use excessive force against the “yellow object.”

The grandpa protester who was hit with pepper spray over the weekend, Chan Ki-kau, was pushed and sprayed by police when he tried to speak with the officers who were arresting a group of teenagers.

Protesters were accused of physically assaulting several pro-China counter-protesters and attempting to take vigilante revenge against several men accused of trying to tear down protest displays, plus one man accused of sexually assaulting a female paramedic. Demonstrators blocked off some key roads with flaming barricades and threw objects at the police after peaceful daytime sit-ins at shopping malls became unruly.

In addition to sitting in at shopping malls, protesters have begun targeting individual shops and merchandise brands for having ties to the Chinese government or bowing to government pressure during the Hong Kong political crisis. Chinese telecom giant Huawei was among the brands singled out by activists, who also trampled Chinese flags and threw them in the trash.

Major rallies were held in Yuen Long, where a landmark event in the protest saga occurred in July, the beating of railroad passengers by a mob of white-clad thugs linked to organized crime. Many protest actions at stations of Hong Kong’s MTR railway are billed as punishment for the railroad because it either looked the other way during the Yuen Long attack or actively collaborated in it. Protest leaders have also criticized MTR for shutting down rail services to make it harder for demonstrators to move around the city.

Other violent clashes were reported at Mong Kok, a crowded district that has seen numerous previous confrontations between protesters and police, and in Tuen Mun, where a scheduled march to protest disruptive singers in the local park grew larger than expected and refused to disperse at the appointed hour."

While in some areas the U.S. can be elastic in its negotiations with China, “we must not allow China to confiscate what belongs only to God: the lives, souls and consciences of vulnerable human beings,” wrote Moore, who is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Mincing no words, Mr. Moore compared the Communist Party under Xi Jinping to post-revolutionary France under Maximilien Robespierre.

“China is imposing a reign of terror on religious minorities — Christian, Tibetan Buddhist, Uighur Muslim, Falun Gong and others,” he wrote. “The state is using everything from concentration camps to facial-recognition technology to ensure that the only worship and belief allowed is that which submits to Chinese Communist orthodoxy.”

“People who resist this mandate are ruthlessly plowed over,” he said.

As Breitbart News has chronicled, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under General Secretary Xi Jinping has engaged in systematic repression of religious practice throughout the nation.

Recently, Christian churches across Henan province were forced to replace the Ten Commandments with quotes from President Xi as part of efforts to “sinicize” religious practice in the officially atheist country.

One pastor from a state-run Protestant church said that the CCP’s latest move is part of a systematic plan to erode Christian doctrine in the country, adding that the ultimate goal of the party is to “become God.”

“The Communist Party’s ultimate goal is to ‘become God.’ This is what the devil has always done,” he said.

The United States has a particular responsibility to “counter China with a resolute commitment to advance not only economic fairness, but also human rights and freedom of conscience,” Moore said Sunday.

This commitment could be shown in a series of very concrete steps, he proposed, including a visit by Sam Brownback, U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom, to the Xinjiang province and the Tibet Autonomous Region and the levying of financial penalties on the Chinese government officials responsible for the persecution.

U.S. lawmakers should also impose sanctions on nations like China that it deems systematic violators of religious liberty as well as demanding the release of China’s prisoners of conscience.

Surely Americans can agree that “we must begin the long and good work of confronting China morally,” Moore wrote. “The persecuted people there do not bear the image of the Chinese Communist Party membership card,” but the image of almighty God.

Modi and Trump rallied together in Houston, Texas with about 50,000 Indian-Americans to hail the economic partnership between the two countries and endorsed their shared values.

“We in India connected well with President Trump and with the words of candidate Trump, ‘Abki Baar, Trump Sarkar’, rang loud and clear,” Modi said.

The slogan ‘Abki Baar Trump Sarkar’ which translated means “This time it’s the turn of the Trump administration” and was used by Trump in an 2016 ad for the Republican Hindu Coaltion. (‘Ab ki baar, Modi sarkar was Modi’s party’s 2014 campaign slogan)

﻿

Modi spoke about Trump during his “Howdy, Modi” event at the NRG Stadium for the NFL’s Houston Texans where he described Trump as a global legend.

“His name comes up in almost every conversation in the world on global politics. His every word is followed by tens of millions,” he said. “He was a household name and very popular even before he went on to occupy the highest office in this great country.”

Modi also shared his admiration for the president and his leadership in the United States.

“I admire him for something more: his sense of leadership, a passion for America, a concern for every American, a belief in American future, and a strong resolve to make America great again,” he said as the crowd applauded. “He has already made the American economy strong again. He has achieved much for the United States and for the world.”

Modi said every time he met Trump, he was struck how friendly he was, describing him as “warm, friendly, accessible, energetic, and full of wit.” He said that Trump promised him that as the president of the United he would be a “friend of India.”

He also praised Trump for his continuing commitment to fighting terrorism.

“I would like to reiterate the fact that President Trump is firmly committed to fighting this battle against terrorism,” he said, prompting a standing ovation from the community in the stadium.

Although Modi did not technically endorse President Trump for re-election in 2020, his reminder of the president’s campaign slogan was not unnoticed. Many in the media described it as a clear endorsement of Trump’s presidency.

The Washington Post described Modi’s speech as “an unmistakable endorsement of Trump’s presidency” and the Indian Express noted that Modi backed Trump for a “second term at White House.”"

Cabinet Office chief Michael Gove drew up plans to outlaw the possession of cat and dog meat over the while he was still Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), according to reports.

However, the move is understood to have been blocked by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), currently headed by former solicitor-general Robert Buckland, after “nervous civil servants” suggested it was “culturally insensitive” and liable to cause offence in Asian countries where cat and dog meat consumption is more common.

The MoJ’s reasoning came as something of a surprise to Giles Watling, a Tory MP who has championed a ban, who pointed out “It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do” in comments to The Sun.

“Dogs are our companion animals. We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world,” he asserted.

Animal welfare campaigners in Asia itself have also stressed the importance of Western governments setting an example, with Kike Yuen of the World Dog Alliance explaining that “legislation against dog meat in UK would provide us with strength to continue our work in Asia, as the UK could influence other countries to stop dog meat consumption” in December 2018.

“Most of them usually refused to do so with the excuse that there is no such law in Western countries.”

Britain’s former colony of Hong Kong, now a semi-autonomous but increasingly repressed province of the People’s Republic of China, is one of the few jurisdictions in the Far East which has banned dog meat, as has the independent Republic of China — commonly known as Taiwan.

“We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world,” claimed a Ministry of Justice spokesman in response to the controversy.

“The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course,” they added non-commitally — language which generally indicates that there are no plans to act on a particular issue.

The president and prime minister both spoke at NRG Stadium in Houston during a event for Trump and Modi supporters billed as a “Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams, Bright Futures” event.

After the speech, Modi approached Trump and urged him to walk around the stadium with him.

Clasping hands, the stadium roared with approval as the pair of leaders walked around the stadium while Indian drums played.

Both leaders pumped their fists and waved at the audience as the event concluded.

Trump and Modi both spoke at the event, championing the economic relationship between the two countries and the jobs created in the Trump administration.

Trump also vowed to protect the American dream for Indian-Americans, thanking them for their hard work and contributions to the United States.

“Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard and pay their taxes, follow our rules and obey our laws,” Trump said.

He noted that Democrats in Washington wanted to raid taxpayer government benefits in favor of illegal immigrants.

“We are going to take care of our Indian-American citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country,” he said.

Modi lavished praise on the president, noting that Trump “calls me a tough negotiator but he himself is a master of the art of the deal and I am learning a lot from him.”

He also described Trump as a “friend” of India and praised his economic success in the United States.

“I admire him for something more: his sense of leadership, a passion for America, a concern for every American, a belief in American future, and a strong resolve to make America great again and he has already made the American economy strong again,” he said."

Thousands gathered in cities across the globe — including London, Berlin, Tokyo, and Washington, DC — to protest anthropogenic climate change and the purported lack of urgency to address it. However, there was a remarkable lack of participation from individuals in China — the planet’s worst greenhouse gas emitter — minus a protest in Hong Kong.

According to the Guardian, “No protests were authorized in China.” However, the China Youth Climate Action Network’s Zheng Xiaowen said that Chinese youth “have their own methods.”

“We also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue,” she added.

Several climate change activists in D.C. decried the U.S. for its role in contributing to climate change despite the fact that the U.S. has made great strides in reducing its carbon output, seeing the “largest decline in CO2 emissions in the world for 9th time this century” in 2017. The largest increase that year came from China.

According to a report released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last year, the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent during President Trump’s first year in office.

“Thanks to President Trump’s regulatory reform agenda, the economy is booming, energy production is surging, and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources,” EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said at the time.

“These achievements flow largely from technological breakthroughs in the private sector, not the heavy hand of government. The Trump Administration has proven that federal regulations are not necessary to drive CO2 reductions,” Wheeler continued.

“While many around the world are talking about reducing greenhouse gases, the U.S. continues to deliver, and today’s report is further evidence of our action-oriented approach,” he added.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) reiterated that point to Greta Thunberg and the other climate kids who testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Select Committee on the Climate Crisis on Wednesday.

“Meanwhile, as the West looks at options to combat climate change, we all know that China’s global emissions continue to rise. For every ton of carbon dioxide reduced by the United States, China adds nearly four times as much,” Kinzinger said.

“Today the Chinese account for 30 percent of global emissions. While some may say that the United States needs to be the leader of combating climate change, I would say that we already are,” he continued.

“Since 2005 global emissions have increased by 20 percent, but the United States emissions have decreased by more than the next 12 emission-reducing countries combined,” he added.

As Breitbart News reported, China is ramping up its coal-powered energy supply “with the total of future projects now standing at 226.2 gigawatts (GW)”:

That is more than twice the amount of fresh capacity planned for India, according to data published Thursday by environmental groups. … With nearly 1,000 GW in operation, China accounts for about half the word’s coal-fired power, with the United States (259 GW) and India (221 GW) a distant second and third, according to the Global Coal Plant Tracker.

Despite China’s blatant disregard for the calls of climate change alarmists, it has been granted permission to speak at the U.N. international climate summit next week in New York."

Hindustan Times reported Friday:

A group calling itself Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front (KKRF) and two unnamed Kashmiri-origin individuals have sued the Indian prime minister [last Thursday] in a federal court in Texas over alleged human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, according to media reports. … Court documents in the U.S. didn’t name the two Kashmiri individuals, a man and a woman, who filed the lawsuit, citing their “fear of retaliation” against family members living in India.The court documents asked the defendants [Prime Minister Narendra Modi and som members of his adminstration] to respond with 21 days to the plaintiffs at Punnun’s address in New York. … The lawsuit was filed by KKRF under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, a federal statute allowing civil suits on U.S. soil against foreign officials, the Houston Chronicle reported.

KKRF filed the suit less than a week before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the Hindu nationalist ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to deliver a speech in Texas alongside President Donald Trump on Sunday.

Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper reported Friday:

The Front has complained that the Modi-led government has occupied Kashmir and on Aug 5 when it annexed the disputed territory in violation of international laws. It has also nominated Indian Interior Minister Amit Shah and another functionary, Kanwal Jeet Singh, as the accused responsible for this illegal occupation and for committing gross human rights violations. The violations include [the imposition of an extended and unprecedented curfew, complete communication lockdown, denial of basic necessities to the inhabitants, illegal detention, enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.

Pro-New Delhi authorities have imposed a security lockdown.

As of early September, Indian authorities had detained up to 4,000 people as part of moves to stop unrests from Modi’s decision to end Indian Kashmir’s autonomy. India has also imposed a communication blackout involving the shutting down of many newspapers, which could mean the number of arrests could be more significant.

Nuclear powers India, Pakistan, and, to a lesser extent, China all have competing claims to Kashmir territories. A border, the Line of Control (LOC), between India and Pakistan separate most of the region between the two rivals, but both countries claim the area in its entirety.

China and India have fought one war over Kashmir, leaving Beijing in control of a small section on the Indian side of the LOC. Pakistan has ceded control of some of its territories to China.

India officially claims control of both Chinese and Pakistani Kashmir, angering Beijing and Pakistan and warning of a potential nuclear war.

Echoing the U.S., New Delhi has long accused Islamabad of backing terrorists who sow unrest in Kashmir and beyond. Meanwhile, Pakistan blames India of human right abuses against dissenters — separatists either looking for independence or a merger with Pakistan.

China and Pakistan have accused India’s ruling government of trying to carry out an “ethnic cleansing” or “genocide” campaign in India’s only predominantly Muslim region — New Delhi-held Kashmir, a charge India denies."

A regional court in the southwestern city of Saratov jailed the six men for up to three and a half years, court spokeswoman Olga Pirueva confirmed on Friday.

“Yes they were convicted,” the spokeswoman, Olga Pirueva, said. “Punishments ranged from three years and six months down to two years (in jail).”

According to the court ruling, the men were found guilty of continually practicing the activities of an “extremist organization” following a 2017 ruling from Russia’s Supreme Court that classified it as such and ordered it to disband.

Although the Putin regime has won plaudits within some Western religious circles over his support for the Russian Orthodox Church, which was heavily suppressed during the era of the Soviet Union, many Orthodox scholars have deemed Jehovah’s Witnesses a threat to Russia’s state institutions and traditional values.

The Putin regime views the domination, headquartered in the town of Warwick, New York, as a dangerous foreign sect seeking to undermine Russian values and institutions, allegations they reject.

In February, Danish construction Dennis Christensen was found guilty by a Russian court of organizing “extremist” activities because of his association with the group, and jailed for six years.

Responding to the persecution, the group’s U.S. spokesperson Jarrod Lopes said that the Russian constitution should guarantee their members right to practice freedom of religion and that they have not committed any crime.

“The whole logic of the accusation was based on the speculative thesis that faith in God is ‘a continuation of the activities of an extremist organization,’” said Lopes. “Instead of searching and proving the guilt of the defendants, the aim of the investigation was to prove their religious affiliation, despite the fact that no religion is prohibited in Russia.”

Around 250 Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia are also facing criminal charges, according to the spokesperson, with 41 of those in detention and 23 under house arrest.

Russia’s persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses has long been criticized by human rights organizations, with the group Human Rights Watch also pointing to the “dozens of home searches, raids, interrogations, and other acts of harassment and persecution.”

“The Jehovah’s Witnesses are simply peacefully exercising their right to freedom of religion,” said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Jehovah’s Witness faith is not an extremist organization, and authorities should stop this religious persecution of its worshipers now.”

“Russia should do right by its national and international obligations to respect freedom of religion,” she continued. “Russian leadership should make sure that law enforcement is honoring and protecting that right, not trampling on it.”

The Hong Kong Free Press explained the unusual nature of the Saturday protest:

The “Reclaim Tuen Mun” event — the second of its kind since the anti-extradition bill movement began — is targeted at the “singing aunties” who frequently appear in the local park. Organisers have demanded that the government change its regulations to prohibit begging and performing for money in the park, to improve law enforcement, and to listen to complaints from the neighbourhood. The march will begin at the San Wo Lane playground at 2pm and will head towards the Tuen Mun Government Offices. Organisers received permission for the event to last until 5pm. “The dai mas in Tuen Mun Park are no longer just a problem of noise pollution, there is a fully-fledged industry behind them. Tuen Mun residents, Hongkongers, are you willing to see your park become a free platform for dai ma groups to earn money every day?” the organisers wrote. Police on Wednesday banned the event citing concerns over potential violence and traffic obstruction. However, the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions overturned the decision on Friday and gave the march a green light.

The phrase dai ma or dama means “big mama” and is meant as a derisive reference to the appearance and inappropriate behavior of many park singers. To put the popular opinion of the singers bluntly, they are seen as middle-aged women singing bad karaoke tunes while dressed in skimpy outfits to cadge money from old men who hang around in the park.

A large protest against the dai ma singers was held in July, denouncing them as visual and audible nuisances who often made park visitors uncomfortable by engaging in indecent behavior or actively soliciting prostitution.

A smaller but spirited counter-protest was soon held by old men who wanted the big mamas to come back. “I paid to touch the ladies’ hands. Why can’t I touch dai mas?” one of the dismayed men marching under a “Singing Is Not a Crime” banner asked plaintively.

Critics accuse the singers of taking advantage of performance zones established in the park for what Americans might think of as folk singers. The risque performances of the dai ma sometimes draw unruly crowds large enough to interfere with other people trying to enjoy the park. Some accuse the Hong Kong police of tacitly indulging the singers by refusing to enforce ordinances that would control their behavior.

“The problem has obviously got out of control. Ten years ago, it was only Cantonese opera singers who performed in an orderly, respectful manner. Now it’s just these groups singing songs nobody wants to hear, and trying to out-sing each other by turning up the loudspeakers to full blast,” Hong Kong Democratic Party Councillor Catherine Wong Lai-sheung remarked in July. According to park rules, the singers are not supposed to be using loudspeakers at all.

The dai ma protest flowed into the massive demonstrations against mainland Chinese infringements of Hong Kong’s autonomy over the summer, in part because the Tuen Mun marchers shared the larger protest movement’s unfavorable view of Hong Kong’s government officials and police.

After the demonstration in July, a good deal of anger was expressed at the police for cracking down much harder on the demonstrators than on the dai ma. Some believe the dai ma are indulged by Hong Kong authorities because most of them are mainland Chinese. The most dire version of this critique holds that the dai ma are encouraged to ply their trade by the mainland Chinese government as part of its campaign to erase Hong Kong’s unique culture.

Tuen Mun’s “self-entertainment zones” were ostensibly scrapped after the July protest, but a backlog of already-approved performance applications was allowed to proceed. Organizers of the protest scheduled for Saturday insist the dai ma are still a major concern which the authorities have not addressed despite their promises."

State-run news service China Daily quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang responding to a media event on the pending legislation held by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and attended by “Hong Kong separatists” Joshua Wong and Denise Ho. China Daily said:

Pelosi and other US politicians “failed to distinguish right from wrong” despite China repeatedly expressing its solemn stance over US meddling in Hong Kong affairs, Geng said. They were “brutally interfering in China’s internal affairs” by threatening to advance the bill, contacting Hong Kong separatists and making irresponsible remarks over Hong Kong affairs, Geng added. He reiterated that no foreign forces are allowed to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, which belong purely to China’s internal affairs. “We strongly urge the US to… stop its interference of any kind in Hong Kong affairs, stop advancing the bill, stop endorsing Hong Kong’s violent and radical forces and separatists, and stop abetting words and deeds that harm the prosperity of the special administrative region,” Geng said. The Office of the Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong also slammed the US politicians’ move, which is at odds with their “claimed support for ‘one country, two systems'” and has “fully exposed their hidden political agenda”.

The Hong Kong office of the Foreign Ministry claimed that the “overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong” want to end the “chaos” of the Hong Kong demonstrations and restore order.

The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act acknowledges that “Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system.” The idea behind the bill is to make Hong Kong’s special trade status contingent on mainland China’s continued respect for the island’s autonomy:

The President shall provide Congress an assessment as to whether to withdraw from the U.S.-Hong Kong extradition treaty, and what actions are needed to protect U.S. citizens and national security interests, if Hong Kong (1) amends its laws to allow the rendition of individuals to countries that lack defendants’ rights protections, or (2) passes a national security law. The State Department shall allow otherwise qualified Hong Kong residents to obtain visas to work or study in the United States, even if the applicant had been arrested for participating in certain nonviolent protests supporting human rights or the rule of law. The President shall report to Congress a list of individuals responsible for abducting and torturing people for exercising internationally recognized human rights in Hong Kong. The bill bars such individuals from entering the United States and imposes sanctions on them.

At the news conference criticized by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Speaker Pelosi said both sides of the aisle in Congress “enthusiastically support this legislation” and stand with “all those who are fighting for a peaceful, hopeful future.”

“This is a battle between democracy and dictatorship,” Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) added.

“The United States must make clear to China that its interference in Hong Kong’s affairs will have consequences,” urged Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who originally introduced the bill.

The Hong Kong bill reportedly has strong support in both houses of Congress but has been received more cautiously by the Trump administration, which has declared support for the right of Hong Kong citizens to protest but wants the U.S. response to be part of the overall trade dispute with China.

The “Hong Kong separatists” castigated by the Chinese Foreign Ministry for speaking to the U.S. Congress included student leader Joshua Wong and actress Denise Ho. Wong warned Congress that Beijing is “grabbing all the economic benefit of Hong Kong’s standing in the world while eroding our freedom.”

“This is not a plea for so-called foreign interference. This is a plea for democracy. This is a plea for the freedom to choose,” said Ho."

Navarro continued, “But the biggest part of the pain China is experiencing, and I don’t think they understood this was going to happen, is that the supply chain is fleeing China right now. And that is a long-term trend. I’m not even sure a deal is going to stop that, unless it’s a deal that they agree to soon because people are leaving China. Business people are leaving China because of a lot of things: high wages, the pollution, but also the fact that they don’t want their technology taken by the Chinese government.”

On Thursday, the country’s Department of Health (DOH) confirmed that the infectious disease, known to cause paralysis and in some cases be fatal, has returned to the country nearly two decades after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Philippines polio-free.

Speaking at the launch of the “End Polio Now” campaign in Quezon City on Friday, Duque argued that there are “multifactorial” causes for the prevailing polio epidemic in the country but that the principal cause is the efforts of anti-vaccination campaigners spreading “misinformation” following the controversy over the Dengvaxia vaccine in 2017.

“The polio vaccine is very safe. We have nothing to worry about because the polio vaccine has been used for a long time, and it has gone through tests that prove its safety, efficacy, and affordability,” said Duque. “Please, I beg of you, for the sake of our children, take care of them. Make sure they have proper hygiene and they get vaccinated.”

“Aside from immunization, we remind the public to practice good personal hygiene, wash their hands regularly, use toilets, drink safe water, and cook food thoroughly,” he added.

Hesitancy over vaccinations became widespread in 2017 after the DOH temporarily suspended a school-based dengue vaccination program after French drug-based vaccine producer Sanofi Pasteur revealed that its product, Dengvaxia, posed greater risks to people without prior dengue infection.

The vaccine was consequently linked to the death of numerous children, leading to a criminal investigation, two congressional inquiries, and a sharp decline in the number of parents getting their children vaccinated. However, the return of polio has sparked concern from WHO, whose representative in the Philippines, Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, urged “local governments to ensure that vaccination campaigns are planned and implemented effectively.”

“We remain very concerned that polioviruses are now circulating in Manila, Davao, and Lanao del Sur,” the organization said in a statement. “Every community leader, religious leader and celebrity must mobilize their communities to participate in immunization activities.”

It continued:

Parents and caregivers are advised that the best protection for their children is vaccination. It takes multiple doses of polio vaccine to achieve full immunity against polio. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a safe and effective vaccine that has saved millions of lives over the years. More than 18 million people are able to walk today who would otherwise have been paralyzed, and 1.5 million childhood deaths have been averted thanks to the polio vaccine. Since the introduction of the polio vaccine in 1988, cases have decreased by over 99%.

The Philippines was declared polio-free in 2000, with the last known case recorded in 1993. The average national polio vaccination coverage stands at about 66 to 68 percent while its target of herd immunity stands at 95 percent, meaning there are still around 5.5 million children left to vaccinate."

TechCrunch reports that Twitter has deleted another 10,112 accounts across six countries that the company believes spreading misinformation and encouraging political unrest in countries with sensitive political climates. Twitter removed more than 4,000 accounts in the United Arab Emirates and China, over 1,000 in Equador, and 259 in Spain.

The full data trove of accounts has been posted for researchers to go through, the entire archive is comprised of millions of tweets reaching one terabyte in size. The latest account removals mark a year of Twitter’s efforts identify and remove accounts that spread political misinformation in attempts to change public sentiment, an issue that has a wide-ranging impact past social media and can actually influence democratic processes such as election and referendum voting.

Breitbart News reported in June that Twitter was forced to apologize for suspending a number of accounts critical of the Chinese government just days ahead of the 30th anniversary of the massacre of protesters at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. The company posted a statement to the company’s Public Policy feed stating that a “number of accounts” were suspended in an attempt to remove accounts that were engaging in “platform manipulation.”

The company stated: “Some of these were involved in commentary about China. These accounts were not mass reported by the Chinese authorities – this was a routine action on our part.” The company added that while performing these actions, they can sometimes “catch false positives or we make errors.”

The company stated: “We apologize. We’re working today to ensure we overturn any errors but that we remain vigilant in enforcing our rules for those who violate them.” Twitter came under fire for its actions from a number of prominent individuals including U.S. Senator Marco Rubio who accused the company of being a Chinese government censor.

Twitter commented on the removal of 267 accounts located in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt stating: “These accounts were interconnected in their goals and tactics: a multi-faceted information operation primarily targeting Qatar, and other countries such as Iran. It also amplified messaging supportive of the Saudi government.” Another 4,258 accounts operating from the UAE posting content directed at Qatar and Yemen were also removed, with Twitter stating: “These accounts were often employing false personae and tweeting about regional issues, such as the Yemeni Civil War and the Houthi Movement.”

Six accounts linked to Saudi Arabia’s state-run media group were found to be “engaged in coordinated efforts to amplify messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government,” according to Twitter. Twitter also removed 4,302 Chinese based accounts that were reportedly helping to “sow discord about the protest movement in Hong Kong.”

General Assembly on Tuesday.

In practice, this meant both a general call to respect national sovereignty and a specific warning that non-Arab powers should not meddle in the affairs of Arab nations, a warning Sisi repeated in several different contexts throughout his address.

Sisi saluted his administration for embarking upon “an ambitious plan to comprehensively advance society,” including “decisively combating terrorism and launching the most ambitious economic reform in [Egypt’s] modern history.”

He said these reforms were “wholeheartedly embraced by the Egyptian people, who have graciously shouldered the burden of their successful implementation in a manner that exceeded all expectations.”

Reminding the audience that Egypt currently chairs the African Union, Sisi praised the “principle of African solutions to African problems,” a “continent-wide vision that is based on our common history, unity of destiny, and confidence in our ability to achieve progress towards integration and upholding the interests of our peoples.”

Sisi praised initiatives like the African Union Center for Reconstruction and Development and the Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development as positive steps toward realizing the potential of Africa, but the balance of his speech laid out some problems that have proven painfully resistant to both “African solutions” and U.N. multilateralism, such as the savage civil wars in Yemen and Syria and the utter disintegration of Libya.

In each case, Sisi declared the urgent need for “political” solutions but offered few suggestions for what those solutions would look like.

“I say that the time has come to take a decisive stance to end the protracted crisis in Yemen through the implementation of a political solution based on the well-known parameters,” he said. “We need to end foreign interventions by non-Arab regional parties which seek to curtail Arab national security.”

“We also need to address the unprecedented threats facing the Arabian Gulf region, including threats facing navigation, as well as recent attacks on oil installations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he added. Those attacks were the work of Iran, which is also the primary “non-Arab regional party” involved in the Yemeni civil war. Sisi did not call the Iranians out by name.

On the “protracted crisis” in Libya, Sisi said the conflict “needs to be stopped” by taking a “bold and decisive stand to address the root causes of the Libyan crisis comprehensively.”

Sisi said part of this comprehensive solution would involve “addressing the grave imbalance of the distribution of wealth and power, and the absence of public oversight by the Libyan people’s elected representatives over political and economic decision-making.” He decried the influence of local militias and foreign powers on the chaos in Libya.

Sisi called for an equally comprehensive solution to the “longest-standing crisis in the Middle East, namely the Palestinian cause.”

“The persistence of this cause without a just solution based on international resolutions calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital does not only mean the continuation of the plight of the Palestinian people, but it also entails the continued depletion of the resources of the peoples of the Middle East,” he said.

“I say that Arabs are open to the realization of a just and comprehensive peace,” he declared. “The Arab peace initiative is still on the table, and there remains an opportunity to launch a new phase in the Middle East. However, we need bold decisions that restore the rights to the Palestinians that pave the way for a major change in the reality of this region.”

Sisi promised that if the Palestinian issue is resolved in this way, it would “lead to the establishment of a security and economic system in the Middle East that is based on peace, security, cooperation, and common interests.”

Sisi stressed the importance of combating terrorism “by confronting all terrorist organizations with no exception” and holding accountable “all those who support terrorism, whether through funding, or whether through weapons, or whether through safe havens or media platforms.”

The Egyptian president called on the United Nations to address the “imbalance in the composition and the shortcomings in the decision-making process” of the U.N. Security Council.

“We must guarantee a balanced representation in the Security Council, and with regard to our African continent, we must work to rectify the historical injustice our continent has been subject to,” he said."

Citing a statement from the NGO, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency (AA) reported Monday:

The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) said 356 people had been arrested since protests began on Sept. 20. Mahienour El-Masry, an Egyptian activist and human rights lawyer, as well as journalists and students, were among those arrested, the statement said. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in central Cairo and several cities on Sept. 20 against Sisi.

The protests stemmed from calls for President Sisi to resign by Mohamed Ali, a former army contractor, who accused al-Sisi and the military of corruption.

In New York, a group of about 60 Egyptian Americans gathered Sunday in support of the anti-Sisi rallies in Egypt. The demonstrators were chanting loudly and boisterously for Sisi to resign outside the New York hotel where the Egyptian president is currently staying, the Middle East Eye (MEE) noted. Sisi is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) this week.

Dalia Wassef, an Egyptian American protest organizer, told MEE.

We are Egyptians from all walks of life. We are not part of any organization. This was just a spontaneous grouping of people. We are here to protest against Sisi’s brutal, corrupt regime and call for democracy in Egypt.

Echoing Wassef, a different protester who identified himself only as Ali, told MEE that it was vital for Egyptians to “come together and work towards getting rid of this guy.”

“Whether you are Islamist or liberal, we all have to get rid of him. He has no legitimacy,” Ali added.

In 2013, then Egypt’s military chief Sisi led the military’s overthrow that toppled the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, the first democratically elected president, following protests against his rule. Sisi has been ruling Egypt as the president since.

For the first time since Sisi officially took power in 2014, tear gas was fired to disperse protestors in Egypt over the weekend. The incident marked some of the first demonstrations since the former minister of defense, and subsequent military chief Sisi took power 2014.

Last Friday, hundreds of Egyptians filled Cairo’s Tahrir Square – a vital site of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution — demanding that Sisi step down. Demonstrations spread to other parts of Egypt. Allegations of corruption against the Sisi administration triggered the protests.

The embattled president dismissed the allegations as “lies and slander,” BBC reports.

Under his tenure, Sisi has dealt with jihadis like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in the Sinai with a heavy hand. BBC, however, reports that “he has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people.”

The British news outlet added:

Egyptians voted to approve constitutional changes in April that could extend Mr Sisi’s term in office until 2030, on a turnout of 44%. He won 97% of the vote in 2018’s presidential election when he faced no serious opposition.

On Monday, Sisi is reportedly expected to meet U.S. President Donald Trump for bilateral talks at U.N. headquarters."

Reports said 31-year-old Karen Turner was sleeping next to her husband, Matthew, and their toddler son when two men allegedly sneaked into the chalet and began attacking them with knives at the Hluleka Nature Reserve in the Eastern Cape Province.

Police said the woman and her unborn baby died instantly while her husband was able to fight off the suspects. He was later taken to a hospital in Pietermaritzburg where he underwent surgery for his injuries.

Reports said the couple’s toddler was unharmed during the horrific incident.

The young mother’s brother, Ian Crouch, told News24 that he was able to speak to the husband after he came out of surgery.

He commented:

His recollection was that he was woken up by being stabbed in the stomach. There was a guy on his side of the bed stabbing him in the stomach and the other chap was stabbing my sister. He said he did manage to sort of grab the guy and there was a bit of a tussle down the stairs. After that, he doesn’t have any recollection.

“The motive behind the murder is currently not known. The crime in South Africa is spiraling out of control with a shocking 21,000 murders and 45,000 rapes reported in 2018,” reports said.

However, Crouch told news outlets on Friday that he arrived at the resort before the police on the day of the tragedy and claimed he heard a woman telling resort employees to blame the murder on a domestic dispute.

“I saw the staff from the resort all gathered together. A woman was talking and said she had been told by ‘Vuyani’ to say there was no staff at the resort after 11pm and no staff before 7am,” he recalled. “She said she had been told there was a party at the chalet and there had been a domestic dispute.”

Vuyani Dayimani is the CEO of the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency (ECPTA) and has since denied giving any instructions to the resort’s employees regarding the incident.

Resort staff allegedly told authorities that people in a neighboring chalet said they heard a “commotion” just before the event took place.

However, police captain Dineo Koena said the deceased woman’s husband “is the only person who will lead us to who did this.”

Reports said that although no arrests have yet been made, the investigation into the death of the mother and her unborn baby are currently underway."

“Martyrs give their lives, they do not hide the fact that they are Christians,” the pope told pilgrims gathered for his General Audience on Wednesday. “Let us remember, some years ago — today there are still many — but we recall four years ago, those Orthodox Coptic Christians, real workers, on the beach in Libya: all of them were slaughtered.”

“But the last word they said was ‘Jesus, Jesus.’ They did not betray their faith, because the Holy Spirit was with them. These are the martyrs of today!” he said.

Today’s martyrs, like the martyrs of the first years of Christianity, are filled with courage by the Holy Spirit, who strengthens them in their witness up to death, Francis said.

“The Apostles did not let themselves be intimidated by anyone. They had an impressive courage!” he recalled, referring to the days after the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.

“We think of them as cowards because they all ran away, they ran away when Jesus was arrested. But they were transformed from cowards into brave men. Why? Because the Holy Spirit was with them,” he said.

“The same happens to us: if we have the Holy Spirit inside, we will have the courage to move forward, the courage to overcome many struggles, not by ourselves but because of the Spirit that is with us. They did not retreat in their mission as intrepid witnesses of the Risen Jesus, like the martyrs of all times, including our own,” he said.

The apostles’ determination made the “religious system” of their day tremble, he said, because “it felt threatened and responded with violence and death sentences,” something we still witness today.

“The persecution of Christians is always the same: people who do not want Christianity feel threatened and thus put Christians to death,” he said.

The pope went on to reflect that merely human projects all eventually fail, but God’s projects endure forever.

“Human projects always fail; they have their time, as we do,” he said. “Think of so many political projects, and how they change everywhere, in all countries. Think of the great empires, think of the dictatorships of the last century: they felt very powerful, they thought they dominated the world. And then they all collapsed.”

“Even today, think of today’s empires: they will collapse, if God is not with them, because the strength that men have in themselves is not lasting. Only the strength of God endures,” he continued.

“Let us think of the history of Christians, including the history of the Church, with so many sins, with so many scandals, with so many bad things in these two millennia. And why didn’t it collapse? Because God is there,” he reflected.

“We are sinners, and so often we give scandal. But God is with us,” he said, “and God saves us.”

The Ebola-affected region of DRC – mostly contained to North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the nation’s east – have suffered decades of guerrilla warfare and lack significant infrastructure to allow for orderly contact tracing, necessary to contain the spread of the virus. Until recently, following up with those impacted by Ebola was a difficult task for contract tracers.

“We used to use paper, filling out a form each day for every contact,” Kavira Kasomo, a contract tracer, said in a WHO article announcing the app. “Then at the end of the day, we took the papers to our supervisors, who alerted the doctor if one of the contacts had signs of Ebola. It took a long time.”

Walking around neighborhoods carrying folders of documents would also raise suspicions from the local community, Kasomo added, with people fearful of being taken away and quarantined if they show any signs of the disease.

“Sometimes when I was carrying papers, I would be chased away, and then I wouldn’t be able to go back for days,” added Jean-Baptiste Kahehoro, another contact tracer.

Go.Data, a new application designed by the WHO, allows information they gather to be sent directly to their supervisors for analysis, which they argue is a “major innovation in outbreak investigation tools for field data collection.”

“It is particularly focused on case and contact data collection and management,” says Armand Bejtullahu, the project leader at WHO and one of the leading designers of the app. “This allows the software to produce outputs, such as contact follow-up forms and dynamic visualization of chains of transmission.”

Other benefits of the technology are explained in detail by the WHO:

As well as speeding up contact tracing, Go.Data helps field teams make sure contacts are not lost. Sometimes, contact tracers are not able to visit all their contacts, perhaps because insecurity in the area prevents them from accessing a household or because of other issues. “When a contact is missed,” says Dr Papy Musakasombo, the head of the Mabolio health zone, “we can see that early enough to do something about it that same day.” For the contact tracers, using a phone means they are less likely to encounter problems in the community. “Everyone has a mobile phone,” says Josué Nebese Kaseme, who is Kanyere’s supervisor. “It’s much more discreet and easier than carrying around a lot of paper forms.” It also helps the contact feel at ease, he adds. For epidemiologists, the visual representation of the transmission chain created by the Go.Data software is particularly valuable. It allows them to understand more easily and comprehensively how the disease spreads: which activities, environments and types of interaction are associated with high or low transmission rates. This means they can tailor the intervention to more quickly interrupt the spread.

The app will soon be rolled out to other parts of the Congo in an effort to improve treatment of the country’s current Ebola outbreak, which has affected around 3150 people (over 2,000 of whom have died) since it was declared on August 1st, 2018. However, the app’s designers envision it eventually being used to treat all types of health epidemics all over the world.

“The Ebola outbreak in the DRC is our major priority,” says Bejtullahu. “Going forward, hopefully Go. Data can really revolutionize the way we tackle epidemics everywhere.”

On the night of 14 to 15 September, the Boko Haram raiders attacked the local church of the Union of Evangelical Churches in the village of Krawa Mafa, burning it to the ground.

Along with the church building, the jihadists burned 50 concessions, stole some 200 goats and sheep, and slaughtered one steer, reports stated.

Though aware of the attack, the local Cameroon military did not attempt to engage the terrorists since they found themselves severely outnumbered. There has been an upsurge of jihadist activity in this border region whose local security forces are understaffed due to a reduction in personnel.

The national government has been asked to take steps to remedy this deficit but so far no action has been taken.

The kidnapping of Catholic priests has also become widespread in Cameroon’s two western regions since the outbreak of an armed conflict in 2017 that has resulted in hundreds of deaths.

Just last month two Catholic priests were kidnapped at gunpoint at Ibal village in the anglophone region of the country’s Northwest.

Father Franklin Banadzem Dindzee, the diocesan youth chaplain of Kumbo Diocese, and Father Patrick Atang were “kidnapped late at night on Thursday along Ibal-Jikejem road on their way to the town of Oku in the Northwest Region,” said a statement by the local Catholic church, which called on the kidnappers to release the clerics unharmed.

The abduction took place on August 15, the Catholic feast of the Assumption, the same day the Bishop of Kumbo, George Nkuo, publicly condemned the atrocities that have been committed in the area, urging Christians to pray for peace for the Northwest and Southwest regions of the country.

In late 2017, Amnesty International reported that Boko Haram had shifted its base of operations from Nigeria into Cameroon, which accounted for an upsurge of Islamist terror attacks in Cameroon.

Dozens of editors and journalists from Africa and Latin America are participating in the half a month event, the Communist Party-owned People’s Daily, which operates BRNN from its headquarters in Beijing, reported Wednesday.

The People’s Daily and China’s State Council of Information, which has a dual identity with the country’s External Propaganda Leading Group, organized the workshop.

On Wednesday, the People’s Daily reported:

A short-term media workshop under the Belt and Road News Network (BRNN) kicked off in Beijing on September 16. Dozens of senior editors and journalists from Latin America and Africa attended the opening ceremony. They were welcomed by smart robots nicknamed Xiao Meng who opened their arms at the gate of the new headquarters of People’s Daily.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping’s multi-trillion-dollar project. It seeks to connect China to the rest of Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America through a network of physical and digital infrastructure.

Many emerging economies across Africa and to a lesser extent European, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin American countries have already signed on to the ambitious project.

People’s Daily conceded that BRNN would play a vital and unique role in promoting and cultivating BRI.

“Responding on President Xi’s proposal, the BRNN was established as a key measure to deepen the Belt and Road media cooperation and people-to-people exchanges,” it added.

The vast majority of media outlets in China are state-run entities used to spread pro-Beijing messages. BRNN is no exception.

It is expected to promote the notion that BRI is intended to help recipient countries, not serve as a vehicle for debt traps that benefit China.

China inaugurated the BRI-focused outlet on April 22. The People’s Daily noted that publishes in six languages including Chinese, English, French, Russian, Arabic, and Spanish. It acknowledged that BRNN would play a vital and unique role in promoting and cultivating, adding:

The visiting journalists agreed that the BRNN provides a platform for equal dialogues and mutual inspiration among the BRI countries and their people. Mainstream media outlets along the Belt and Road will further expand cooperation, innovate cooperation modes, enrich cooperation content and jointly build the BRNN into a platform of news sharing, exchanges, and cooperation, as well as communication.

The U.S. has warned that China is seeking to use BRI to accomplish its dream of global hegemony.

China is also using BRI to push its communist and a form of debt trap colonialism, some American experts told U.S. lawmakers in May.

Some concerns about being unable to pay China are beginning to surface in Africa and elsewhere, but China denies the U.S. accusations, dismissing them as a smearing campaign."

The Times of South Africa reports that the case was brought to the Constitutional Court, the highest court in the country, by the civil society group Freedom of Religion South Africa (FORSA) as a challenge to a previous ruling from the South Gauteng High Court that deemed parents using physical force against their children as unconstitutional.

The debate began in 2017 when a man in Johannesburg was found guilty of assault against his 13-year-old son for beating him after catching him viewing pornographic material. In his defense, the father argued that he was administering “moderate and reasonable chastisement” previously allowed under common law. However, the Constitutional Court unanimously upheld the 2017 ruling, stating that that were effective ways of disciplining a child without resorting to corporal punishment.

“The vulnerability of children, their rights to dignity and to have the paramountcy of their best interests upheld, as well as the availability of less restrictive means to achieve discipline, render moderate and reasonable chastisement unconstitutional,” the court wrote in its ruling.

The High Court had previously ruled that spanking amounted to a violation of children’s rights, arguing that protection from all forms of violence was absolutely critical in the context of alarmingly high levels of child abuse across South Africa. The initial ruling also argued that the case was about providing children with “equal protection of the law, dignity, freedom from all forms of violence and degradation, bodily and psychological integrity, and the child’s right not to be discriminated against based on age.”

FORSA demanded the ruling be overturned, arguing that there is an obvious distinction between “reasonable” and “moderate” chastisement and unabated child abuse and that parents maintained the right to decide what was best for their children. In a statement, they said they were acting on behalf of the public interest and those who “believe that the scriptures and other holy writings permit, if not command, reasonable and appropriate correction of their children.”

Their position was opposed by various civil society groups, including the Children’s Institute, the Quaker Peace Centre and Sonke Gender Justice, who stated in written submissions that “positive parenting” was the solution to bad or disruptive behavior.

“The aim is to develop an ethos or inner conviction in the child that will ensure that they will behave well, even when their parents are not present,” they said in a written submission. “It builds feelings of confidence and assertiveness rather than feelings of helplessness and humiliation.”

Such opposition was also backed by the government, who said that children should be protected from all types of violence. “Any act that harms a child’s right to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation is unlawful and unconstitutional,” said Nkosinathi Dladla, legal services director in the social development department.

The ruling now paves the way for South African parliament to draw up legislation formally criminalizing the use of physical force against children.

The Herald’s senior reporter Zvamaida Murwira reported Tuesday that work on the building has already begun, less than two weeks after Mugabe died aged 95.

“What the nation might want to know is that work has commenced,” said Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing Deputy Minister Jennifer Mhlanga. “In as far as design is concerned, yes, work is being done. The costs will only be known once we have the design.”

Secretary for Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Melusi Matshiya added that they were coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works, and National Housing.

“Yes, work is going on, but the lead ministry is that of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing when it comes to construction work,” Matshiya said.

According to Herald journalists who visited the National Heroes Acre where Mugabe’s tomb will be located, authorities have already brought in earthmoving equipment and construction personnel.

The location was confirmed last week by his nephew Leo Mugabe, who works as the family spokesperson, who announced that they had agreed to a government request to bury Mugabe in an official cemetery in the capital of Harare.

“The government and the chiefs went to the Heroes Acre, showed each other where President Mugabe is going to be buried, and that place would take about 30 days to complete,” he said. “So what that means is the burial will take that long.”

The Mugabe family had previously insisted that he be buried at his home village in the district of Zvimba, around 50 miles outside Harare, suggesting that a symbolic funeral at Heroes’ Acre as a compromise.

Eventually, it was agreed that he be given a state funeral in what turned out to be a sparsely attended ceremony at the National Sports Stadium here in Harare. Despite having a capacity 60,000 people, it is estimated that three-quarters of the stadium remained empty, a sign of his widespread unpopularity in recent years.

The shrine currently being built will be paid for by taxpayers. The government has yet to reveal its price, or even offer an estimate.

Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before being ousted in a coup in 2017 and replaced with former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Despite allowing protests so long as they enabled his rule, Mnangagwa has attempted to rehabilitate Mugabe’s image while in power, establishing a national holiday for the dictator and spending millions of taxpayers’ dollars on luxury amenities for Mugabe and wife Grace. Zimbabwe’s impoverished citizens paid for, among other things, a 20-person staff of servants, three luxury vehicles, a “reasonably-sized” mansion, and first-class international air travel.

Mugabe’s 40-year leadership of Zimbabwe was marked by genocide, persecution of political opponents, and vote-rigging on an industrial scale. His left-wing economic policies also turned the country from of the wealthiest in Africa, into an unprecedented economic disaster of such a scale that his government was forced to introduce a one hundred trillion-dollar note before eventually reverting to the U.S. dollar.

The town’s Mayor Sayid Ali Ibrajim told VOA that an RPG fired by the militants caused most of the casualties. Somali government forces with support from African Union [AU] forces, who are based outside the town, repelled the attack, according to officials.

Some of the residents in Qoryoley alleged that heavy weapons fired by AU troops caused some of the civilian casualties.

Gov. Ibrahim Adan Najah from the region that houses Qoryoley told Voice of America that authorities are probing the claims of troops targeting civilians.

The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) did not immediately respond to the allegations.

On Saturday, mortars fired by al-Shabaab (or al-Shabab) on the ancient port town of Marka during a visit by Somali Prime Minister Hassan Ai Khaire also killed two civilians.

VOA noted:

Al-Shabab claimed they were targeting the prime minister but … Governor Najah told VOA Somali that the incident took place outside the town. Residents and security sources said one of the mortars landed in a residential area killing two women. The prime minister was unharmed and has returned to Mogadishu safely.

On Sunday, al-Shabaab also targeted Gov. Najah’s convoy with a remote-controlled bomb, killing two bodyguards and injuring four others near the town of Shalanbod.

Moreover, the al-Qaeda branch also killed four high-level regional officials, including the deputy governor for finances, and injured six others on Saturday in the nearby Middle Shabelle region.

A report released on September 10 by the New York-based International Peace Institute revealed that al-Shabaab has killed “between 1,483 and 1,884” AMISOM troops between March 2007 and December 2018.

Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Uganda also participate in the AMISOM peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The new report does not breakdown the fatalities by country of origin.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has increased airstrikes against al-Shabaab to unprecedented levels, a move that has led to a slight decline of attacks by the terrorist group.

Somali-born Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), however, complained in May that Trump has dramatically intensified American airstrikes on her native country.

Under pressure by the U.S. air campaign, the terrorist group has even resorted to executing some of its members and other civilians accused of espionage.

The U.S. military also lends assistance to AMISOM."

Khalifa Haftar on Monday launched airstrikes on the coastal city of Sirte currently held by the internationally recognized government, expanding the conflict beyond the capital of Tripoli.

Since April, Haftar’s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying to take Tripoli from the Government of National Accord (GNA) headquartered there. The LNA has conquered most of Libya with the help of Russia, France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) but has failed to take Tripoli.

Some of Haftar’s international supporters are reportedly helping the warlord with airstrikes against the United Nations-brokered GNA and its backers, backed by Turkey and Qatar.

Human rights groups have accused both warring sides — the LNA and GNA — of war crimes against civilians in Libya.

Referring to the Tripoli operation, Reuters reports:

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people in Tripoli alone, killed hundreds of civilians, and risks disrupting oil supplies from the country in chaos since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. There have been LNA-claimed strikes in recent days on Sirte, some 450km (280 miles) by road east of Tripoli, but mainly on the outskirts, residents said. Haftar … might be trying to shift the frontline [to] Sirte away from Tripoli where he has been unable to breach the city’s defenses and even lost his main forward base in Gharyan, said Emad Badi, a Libya researcher. Such a move would also pre-empt attacks on the main LNA supply base in Jufra, a central oasis, which the Tripoli forces have attacked by air, said Badi, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute.

Jufra borders Sirte in the north and the oasis town of Murzuq in the south. In August, the U.N. expressed concern about the growing number of casualties stemming from airstrikes, rocket attacks, shelling, and direct ground engagements in Murzuq. The U.N. warned that the region is facing a “humanitarian crisis” linked to the ongoing fighting.

LNA troops reportedly targeted GNA-allied local forces charged with securing Sirte.

Moreover, the U.N-backed government reportedly said on Facebook that drones operated by Haftar ally, the UAE, had attacked some of its partners in the region.

Haftar and his LNA are loyal to the breakaway government based in eastern Libya’s Tobruk region. Haftar’s supporters believe he can bring stability and defeat the jihadi groups operating in Libya. Since the U.S.-backed fall and subsequent death of dictator Gaddafi, Libya descended into chaos with rivaling governments competing for power and jihadi group’s establishing a foothold.

“Haftar’s critics accuse him of trying to seize power through a military coup, deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and west of the sprawling North African country,” Reuters noted.

American officials and other observers once considered Sirte the largest Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) stronghold outside of Iraq and Syria.

In December 2016, the U.S. military helped local militias retake Sirte from ISIS, but the terrorists continue to operate in and around the area.

Sirte sits alongside the unofficial border between the western territory controlled by the GNA based in Tripoli and the eastern lands held by the LNA’s renegade government in Tobruk.

Some ISIS fighters are trying to regroup in and around Sirte, some Libyans warned in April, according to the Middle East Eye (MEE).

The jihadi group wants to strengthen their position, while the LNA and GNA annihilate one another.

Haftar has accused the GNA of working with ISIS and other jihadis.

The LNA and GNA have intensified airstrikes in recent weeks in anticipation of a conference in Germany that is expected to bring together the foreign stakeholders active in the North African country."

While the words of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra referred in the first place to Europe’s problems with waves of migrants arriving from Africa, he went on to suggest interconnections between diverse areas of development.

“There will be no integral ecology without peace and there will be no peace without integral ecology,” Touadéra said. Moreover, “in a country there will be peace if there is access to healthcare for all citizens.”

The African politician was speaking in Madrid at a conference titled “Encounter for Peace,” organized by the Saint Egidio Catholic community.

In his address, Touadéra underscored the need “to renew the essential link between Africa and Europe,” while also proposing that disarmament, universal health care, and the abolition of the death penalty are essential conditions to achieving peace.

“What Europe has done is today a dream in Africa,” Touadéra said. “Peace without borders is not just a beautiful title but a beautiful perspective to look toward.”

The Central African Republic has experienced an ongoing civil war since 2012, which shows little sign of abating, and tensions are compounded by religious strife between Muslim Séléka fighters and Christian anti-balaka militias.

“The Central African Republic is a house in which many weapons have entered, so now we are going to launch a disarmament program,” Touadéra said, insisting that “the blood of our people spilled unjustly urges us not to make the same mistake in the future.”

The African president also stressed that war is avoidable but that peace demands a concerted effort from everyone.

“War and violence are not an inevitable destiny,” he said, but peace can never be taken for granted but requires ongoing vigilance.

“It’s like building a house that always needs maintenance because otherwise it would be at the mercy of the wind,” he said.

This represents the largest coordinated action against online scammers yet undertaken.

Wired reports that the DOJ has announced the arrest of 281 individuals suspected to be connected to email scams and wire transfer fraud. The sweeping arrests were the biggest of its kind yet against digital scammers and shows law enforcement sense of urgency in dealing with the rapidly growing threat of online scams.

Wired reports:

Tuesday’s law enforcement initiative, dubbed Operation reWired, involved extensive international coordination to make 167 arrests in Nigeria, 74 in the United States, 18 in Turkey, and 15 in Ghana. The remainder took place in France, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. Research and law enforcement investigations have shown that a large proportion of all email scamming originates in West Africa, specifically Nigeria, but the scams have spread, partly because some West African actors have moved around the world.

Wired notes that email scams have become widespread in the last few years and attacks have become increasingly sophisticated:

The scams feel so pervasive in part because they’re not always just basic email scams. They encompass a complex web of connections between traditional email scamming, W-2 tax fraud, check fraud, gift card scams, and more involved schemes.

For example, employment scammers trick people into submitting their personally identifying information to bogus job listings and then “hire” them for work-from-home jobs. They overpay them for their work, and then ask the victim to wire back the overage before the initial payment goes through. Similar bait-and-switch fraud centers on rentals, lottery tickets, and online car sales. In romance scams, attacks will spend months or even years establishing deceptive romantic relationships with victims online. They’ll then not only siphon their target’s money directly but use them as middlemen to transmit stolen funds

Wired adds that although the sudden arrest of 281 individuals seems like a big deal, due to the scale and popularity of digital scams it may not have as big an effect as many may thing:

“Will it make a dent? It’s really hard to say,” says Crane Hassold, senior director of threat research at Agari who previously worked as a digital behavior analyst for the FBI, of the arrests. “There are so many actors doing BEC and other types of social engineering scams—there could be thousands, especially in West Africa—that it’s going to be difficult to make a significant impact overall.”

MDC leader Nelson Chamisa has urged the public against attacking Mugabe at his own funeral, reportedly believing such a move to be “uncultured,” according to national newspaper New Zimbabwe. Many of those who disagree are younger members of the party, who grew up knowing only Mugabe as national leader, and lost relatives to his decades of slaughter.

Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before his own Zanu-PF party ousted him in a coup in 2017. He died in Singapore, where he had spent months receiving treatment for liver issues. He was 95 years old, and 93 when he left power.

The most prodigious human rights atrocity during his rule was “Operation Gukurahundi,” the genocide of an estimated 20,000 people of the Ndebele indigenous group between 1983 and 1987 by elite, North Korea-trained forces loyal to Mugabe. The Ndebele largely rejected Mugabe and his Shona people as rulers. In the decades following Gukurahundi, Mugabe is believed to have killed thousands of dissidents in “road accidents, poison and at times burning them in huts as he sought to retain power by hook or crook,” as New Zimbabwe described it.

“We are not happy at all. This is a man who killed our members for fun during his days in power. We cannot pretend that he is a saint today,” an unnamed “youth” told the newspaper. “That African culture dictates that we sanctify the departed is not applicable here. Chamisa, [MDC deputy leader Tendai] Biti and all other party leaders should just have kept their mouths shut.”

Chamisa and Biti outraged the members of their party by expressing condolences to the Mugabe family and praising the late tyrant. Chamisa had also noted that, because of the coup against him. Mugabe had become an opposition supporter late in life.

“What is gratifying to us is that at the end of his reign he voted for change, he voted for me, in fact, Mr Mugabe is one of the few people who did not hide their vote,” Chamisa told Al Jazeera. “We have lost a voter, we have lost a supporter, we have lost a citizen, an African son.”

Biti, meanwhile, told opponents of Mugabe, “His legacy shouldn’t be detracted by the fact that there were atrocities.”

Biti himself has said he was “tortured” by Mugabe’s thug forces for being a member of the opposition.

“This is not funny at all. Mugabe killed many of our colleagues and never got to account for it. What is it our leaders got from Mugabe that they see him as a hero today?” another anonymous MDC member told Zimbabwe Voice, and online outlet. Yet another opposition supporter speaking to the outlet said they were “shocked but not surprised” at Chamisa, calling the opposition “very weak.”

“We are going nowhere with these clueless opposition leaders,” the unnamed individual lamented.

Pride Mkono, who went on the record as a youth leader for the opposition, said it was “shocking” that Chamisa and the MDC leadership were not attacking Mugabe because he had recently died.

“Those that are celebrating Mugabe’s violent legacy are either nonsensical, naive or both,” said Mkono. “It is especially shocking coming from purported leaders of the opposition.”

Mugabe’s funeral arrangements have become a matter of controversy as his body makes its way back from Zimbabwe. Local outlets reported this week that there was some discord between the government of Zimbabwe, who wished to bury him with other communist leaders in Harare, and family members who sought the full funeral rites of a Shona chief that they believed Mugabe deserved.

A spokesman for the family, nephew Leo Mugabe, told reporters that there was no disagreement between Harare and the Mugabe family.

“There’s no feud between the family and government. As to where he will be buried is dependent on the family, the family and chiefs in Zvimba are the people that will determine basically where he’s going to be buried,” Leo Mugabe said. “To say there’s [a] feud is not correct, not true. We’ve been meeting with government and everything has been very smooth, there’s understanding, there’s clarity on responsibilities and therefore, there is no feud whatsoever.”

The government is holding a public viewing of the body on Thursday at Rufaro Stadium in Mbare, then a funeral in Harare on Saturday before the final burial. Those organizing the rites have not made public yet where Mugabe’s final resting place will be.

Leo Mugabe told reporters that the final resting place is a decision that Shona chiefs must make.

“The chiefs in Zvimba still regard him as a chief and in terms of tradition, they are the ones that determine where is he going to be buried, how is he going to be buried, the procedures that must be followed in his burial,” Mugabe said. “This is a cultural thing and nobody can push the chiefs to divulge where they are going to bury [Mugabe].”

Leaders of several African allies, including Nigeria and South Africa, are expected to attend Mugabe’s official funeral. President Mnangagwa, who organized the coup against Mugabe after his wife Grace Mugabe forced him into exile, had kind words for the dictator upon his death on Friday, calling him “an icon of liberation.”

Mnangagwa and the nation’s military did not interrupt the thousands-strong protests against Mugabe in 2017 that called for him to be removed. Instead, Zanu-PF leaders claimed to listen to the people and begin impeachment proceedings in the legislature, which never came to fruition because Mugabe resigned.

Mnangagwa has since established a national holiday to celebrate the man he forced out of office.

“We are witnessing foreign elements that are trying to spread homosexuality in Ethiopia using aid, politics, and technology,” said a spokesperson for Dereje Negash (pictured), a religious group affiliated with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. “To this end, they are spending millions of dollars.”

“Same-sex couples are getting married secretly here in Ethiopia. It should stop, and stop now,” said leaders of the group at a press conference Sunday in the nation’s capital of Addis Ababa.

The group has called on the government to adopt stricter laws on the punishment of homosexual activity. At present, Ethiopian anti-sodomy laws stipulate up to 15 years in prison for any homosexual act, but church leaders have said this is insufficient.

“Our culture does not leave room for this type of activity. We have values ​​that are losing their importance because of the proliferation of these practices,” they said.

The group’s leaders said the government’s indifference has helped to embolden the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) movement in the East African country.

While Ethiopia is divided between Christianity and Islam, leaders of both faiths have united in their opposition to homosexual practice.

Last June, religious leaders from different faiths called on their government to take a stand against an American travel agency claiming to be the only gay travel agency in the world, which was advertising visits to Ethiopia’s historic sites.

“The Ethiopian government should address this matter and play its part in protecting the younger generation from immoral practices, which are contrary to Ethiopian values ​​and religion,” the religious leaders said.

The groups were particularly upset that the itinerary offered by the Toto Tours company included religious sites.

Since coming to power, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been advocating political and economic openness, while remaining silent on the question of homosexuality.

More than half of African nations have laws criminalizing homosexual relations, where many regard homosexuality as a western import. These laws have been targeted by human rights NGOs who push for greater openness to homosexual activity on the continent.

Survivors of the 1980s Gukurahundi genocide of the Ndebele people, who were murdered in massive numbers by the Zimbabwean government after it achieved independence from white rule through a bloody insurrection gathered in London over the weekend. While many mainstream media reports have written of Mugabe’s legacy in measured tones, his victims had a different story to tell.

One survivor told Breitbart London: “Mugabe’s legacy? He doesn’t have a legacy. What other people see as a legacy, I see as brutality… my father was murdered by his regime in 1983… I didn’t go to school because of him.

“I was tortured in 2001 [at the] police station… they came and dispersed everyone with police dogs and batons, beating everyone up. I was locked up for six hours at the police station, hung by one leg from the roof, put inside a drum, beaten… I didn’t know whether I was going to survive.”

Zimbabwe'e brutal former leader Robert Mugabe, who turned his rich and fertile country from the breadbasket of Africa to a total basket case in one generation, has died https://t.co/8yL4xB1My5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 6, 2019

Another said while Mugabe had left a legacy, it was not a positive one, remarking: “we are now fighting to destroy his legacy that he left with the Zanu-PF [Mugabe’s political party]… the legacy of torture, intimidation, killing people, abducting.”

Mugabe’s legacy was also economic. During his brutal reign, the land went from being the richest and most productive country in Africa to one of the poorest, suffering massive hyperinflation and total collapse of basic services and unemployment. On the reasons for the former British colony and the ‘breadbasket of Africa’ Rhodesia having become the basket case of Zimbabwe, one demonstrator told Breitbart:

“…my aunties, my nephews, I lost a lot of my family members through the butchering of the Ndebele… there is no money, there is no employment. There is no electricity, there is no water.

“I do blame Mugabe for that because he’s the one who drove all the white farmers out of the country. If it wasn’t for him, we would be in a better state by now.”

Despite the atrocities visited upon his own people, Mugabe never faced justice for his actions and, thanks to a global network of supporters and massive embezzlement of his country’s wealth, was able to die in comfort. For that reason, he died too soon, one said, remarking: “Some people are rejoicing he’s dead. For me, I’m sad because I wanted him to live so he could face [justice for] his criminal activities… we didn’t want him to die yet.”"

“Citizenship in Sudan is not based on religion,” Mufreh said. “Sudan is pluralistic in its thinking, pluralistic in its culture, in its Islamic religious ideologies and sects and even in religions.”

“There is Islam, Christianity, and a minority that follows the Jewish faith,” Mufreh said. “It is possible that the minority has left the country and from here we would like to issue an invitation to return because Sudan, as long as there is a civilian government, believes that nationality is based on rights and duties.”

Mufreh made these remarks during an interview with Al Arabiya, the Saudi Arabian free-to-air television news channel.

Sudan once was home to a thriving Jewish community of some 1000 members, led by Rabbi Shlomo Malka from 1906 to 1949, the year of his death. Most abandoned the country as Islamic rule grew more pervasive.

Over the weekend, Sudanese writer Haidar Al-Mukashafi said on television that the Jewish presence in Sudan dates back over 1000 years, and there was even a rumor in the Sudanese city of Merow that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was born and raised in Sudan.

In his interview, Al-Mukashafi said that Jews and other minorities may come back to Sudan if reforms take place and there are sufficient incentives to do so.

Last week, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok announced the formation of the new government as part of the country’s transition to democracy, the first since the overthrow of the dictatorship of Omar al Bashir last April.

In July, the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) alliance agreed to a 39-month transitional process to return to democracy, including the creation of executive, legislative, and judicial structures and procedures.

The new transition team, Hamdok said at a press conference, is currently made up of 18 ministers who will be joined by two more and will immediately begin their work “in a harmonious and collective manner.”

The new executive includes four women, including Asmaa Abdallah, who has become the nation’s first female foreign minister.

He said poverty must be fought against and overcome.

The pope visited Akamasoa, the “City of Friendship,” a community founded 30 years ago for very poor families by a former student of Pope Francis, Father Pedro Pablo Opeka, an Argentine missionary.

“It is a great joy for me to meet you in this great work,” Francis said. “Akamasoa is the expression of God’s presence in the midst of his poor people; not a sporadic, circumstantial presence, but the presence of a God who decided to live and always remain in the midst of his people.”

Some 8,000 brightly dressed young people were present to greet the pope with songs and chants.

“Seeing your radiant faces,” the pope said, “I thank the Lord who has heard the cry of the poor and who has manifested his love with concrete signs such as the creation of this town.”

“Your cries that arise from the powerlessness of living without a roof, of seeing your children grow up malnourished, of joblessness, because of the indifferent — not to say disdainful — gaze of so many, have become songs of hope for you and for all who contemplate you,” he said.

“Every corner of these neighborhoods, every school or clinic is a song of hope that denies and silences all inevitability,” he added. “Let us say it loudly: poverty is not an inevitability.”

“This town is the result of many years of hard work” and “has a long history of courage and mutual help,” Francis said. “In its foundations we find a living faith that has been translated into concrete acts, capable of ‘moving mountains.’”

This faith has “allowed us to see possibility where only precariousness was seen, to see hope where only hopelessness was seen, to see life where so many announced death and destruction,” he said, reminding the people of the saying of the apostle Saint James: “Faith without works is dead.”

Part of the legacy of Akamasoa, Francis said, is an education in values instilled by Father Opeka, resulting in an “enormous treasure of effort, discipline, honesty, respect for themselves and others.”

This has led the town to comprehend “God’s dream” of personal development and especially the progress of the whole community, he said, since there is no worse slavery “than for each person to live only for himself.”

Dear young people of Akamasoa, the pope concluded, “never cross your arms before the dire effects of poverty, and never succumb to the temptations of the easy path or of locking yourselves in yourselves.”

“Let the gifts that the Lord has given you flourish in you. Ask him to help you put yourself at the service of your brothers and sisters with generosity. Thus, Akamasoa will not only be an example for future generations, but much more,” he said.

“Your lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal biodiversity, yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation, from which some profit,” Pope Francis told authorities and diplomats on Saturday.

“The deterioration of that biodiversity compromises the future of the country and of the earth, our common home,” he warned.

The pope went on to enumerate his vision of the problem, while also recognizing that many poor people derive their livelihood from activities that threaten the environment.

“As you know, the last forests are menaced by forest fires, poaching, the unrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands,” he said. “Plant and animal biodiversity is endangered by contraband and illegal exportation.”

“It is also true, however, that, for the peoples concerned, a number of activities harmful to the environment at present ensure their survival. So it is important to create jobs and activities that generate income, while protecting the environment and helping people to emerge from poverty,” he declared.

The pontiff tied together social and ecological problems, insisting that the two are intimately intertwined.

“We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental,” he said.

“In a word, there can be no true ecological approach or effective efforts to safeguard the environment without the attainment of a social justice capable of respecting the right to the common destination of earth’s goods, not only of present generations, but also of those yet to come,” he said.

Pope Francis has made the care of the environment a central theme of his six-year pontificate, returning again and again to issues of ecological responsibility, the dangers of carbon emissions, and the scourge of climate change.

In 2015, he became the first pope in history to devote an entire encyclical letter to the topic of the environment with the publication of Laudato Si (“Praised Be”), urging Christians to become more ecologically aware.

In that text, the pontiff said that the earth “is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth” as “once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish.”

He also denounced a failure to recycle paper and other resources, while calling climate change “a global problem with grave implications” and “one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.”

Citing “scientific studies,” the pontiff said that “most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity.”

During his tenure, Mugabe was a loyal ally to communist nations around the world including Cuba, North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. Far-left leaders in Africa and around the world celebrated the “comrade” despite his record of genocide, political repression, and mass starvation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was among the first to issue a statement following Mugabe’s death.

“Many important dates in Zimbabwe’s modern history are tied to the name of Robert Mugabe. He made a great personal contribution to the battle for your country’s independence, to the building of Zimbabwean state institutions,” Putin said, noting that Mugabe maintained “friendly relations” with Putin.

Mugabe led a bloody revolution against the white then-Prime Minister Ian Smith of Rhodesia, the nation that would become Zimbabwe, garnering support by branding himself a liberator of Africans suffering under an anachronistic British leftover political system. Mugabe earned praise before embarking on the Gukurahundi genocide of 1983, designed to eliminate resistance to Mugabe and his Shona tribe from the Ndebele people who are also indigenous to Zimbabwe.

Using an elite force of military killers trained by North Korea, Mugabe is believed to be behind the killing of at least 20,000 people. Having consolidated his power, Mugabe used it to offer international support for the world’s communists, from those in South Africa to communist rulers across the planet in China and Cuba.

Despite the mass extermination of black people that allowed him to stay in power for nearly 40 years, African leaders applauded his tenure on Friday.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari – who became the nation’s president in 2015 after being its dictator in the 1980s – hailed Mugabe through a statement from spokesman Femi Adesina.

“President Buhari believes Mugabe’s sacrifices, especially in struggling for the political and economic emancipation of his people, will always be remembered by posterity,” Adesina said. “He, however, prayed that the Almighty God will grant the soul of the former president rest and comfort his loved ones.”

“South Africans join the people and government of Zimbabwe in mourning the passing of a liberation fighter and champion of Africa’s cause against colonialism,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his statement. “Under President Mugabe’s leadership, Zimbabwe’s sustained and valiant struggle against colonialism inspired our own struggle against apartheid and built in us the hope that one day South Africa too would be free.”

“Comrade Mugabe was an outstanding revolutionary, a tenacious freedom fighter, and a dedicated Pan Africanist,” said the president of Namibia, Hage Geingob. “He made enormous sacrifices in the struggle against injustice and the liberation of Southern Africa from racial subjugation and colonial oppression.”

The government of Iran, which maintains friendly ties to all communist dictatorships, also offered its condolences.

“Mugabe after Zimbabwe’s independence continued to stand firm in defense of his country’s national sovereignty against foreign interference,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi told reporters, thanking Mugabe for his support of the Islamic regime. Iran’s Mehr News Agency reported that Mousavi referred to Mugabe as a “hero.”

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called Mugabe “exceptional.”

“Mr. Robert Mugabe was an exceptional leader of the national liberation movement and politician of Zimbabwe, who spent his lifetime safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, opposing external interferences and promoting the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Zimbabwe and the other parts of Africa,” Geng told reporters. “We deeply mourn his passing and extend sincere condolences to the Zimbabwean government and people as well as his family.”

The Castro regime in Cuba did not issue a Foreign Ministry statement because it had Deputy Foreign Minister Marcelino Medina Gonzalez in Harare meeting with high-ranking officials at the time.

Medina reportedly offered “condolences and solidarity” to the ruling Zanu-PF party, to which Mugabe belonged but which also ousted him in 2017 with the support of the military. Medina is in Zimbabwe to reportedly improve bilateral ties and will conduct a four-nation tour of Africa before he returns to Havana.

The Venezuelan socialist regime, which operates as a proxy of Cuba’s, has not at press time issued an official statement of condolence, nor has North Korea’s. Venezuela’s state-owned broadcaster VTV, however, did publish an article stating that “many consider him a hero who ended the rule of the white minority in the African nation.”

At home, current President Emmerson Mnangagwa – Mugabe’s former vice president who orchestrated a coup against him – called Mugabe “an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people.”

Mugabe likely died a billionaire; his net worth at the time of his ouster in 2017 was estimated to be over $1 billion. As part of his agreement with Mnangagwa post-coup, the Zimbabwean taxpayer was responsible for paying for the salaries of at least 20 caretakers, three luxury vehicles, up to four international flights on private jets, and a “reasonable” mansion.

Mugabe died on Thursday in Singapore at the age of 95. He ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist from 1980 to 2017.

Mugabe was an “ex-guerrilla chief who took power after independence from white minority rule in 1980 and presided over a country whose early promise was eroded by economic turmoil and allegations of human rights violations,” the Associated Press (AP) noted.

In November 2017, a coup staged by the military forced the Zimbabwean strongman to resign. He was the oldest head of state and one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders at the time.

Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party remains in power under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, one of the late dictator’s former vice-presidents.

Below are five of the horrors experienced by Zimbabweans during Mugabe’s tenure.

Genocide

Known as the darkest stain of his legacy, Mugabe sanctioned the massacre of as many as 20,000 mostly ethnic Ndebele people in western Zimbabwe. The carnage came soon after he helped end white colonial rule in the African country in 1980.

The genocide came to be known as Gukurahundi, a Shona language word that is loosely translated to mean the “early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains.”

On Thursday, Reuters reported:

Just three years after Zimbabwe’s independence from Britain, Robert Mugabe sent the army’s North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade into Matabeleland to crush dissidents and former guerrillas loyal to liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo. Over the next two years, human rights groups estimate as many as 20,000 people died in western Zimbabwe, most of them ethnic Ndebele. … Many of the victims were executed, often after being forced to dig their own graves. Others were thrown down wells or disused mine shafts. Rape, torture, mass beatings and wholesale destruction of villages were also commonplace, according to “Breaking the Silence,” a seminal 1997 report on the episode by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.

Persecution of LGBT Zimbabweans

Mugabe was furiously anti-gay, calling tolerance for gay rights “unnatural” and “filth.”

He criminalized homosexuality and dismissed demands that the government must treat it as a human rights issue.

In 2013, he threatened to decapitate homosexuals.

Human Rights Watch acknowledged Thursday:

[In 2013], amidst attacks against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, Mugabe cemented his long history of anti-LGBT rhetoric and actions by reiterating his 1995 statement that LGBT people were “worse than dogs and pigs” and threatened to behead them.

The former autocrat’s anti-gay legacy “lives on,” Pink News reported Thursday, adding:

When Zimbabwe first gained independence in 1980 it had a flourishing gay scene in urban areas. Then Robert Mugabe took power, and after nearly four decades of demonizing and persecuting the LGBT+ community, the country now has one of the worst LGBT+ rights records on the African continent. LGBT+ Zimbabweans have absolutely no legal protections from discrimination, violence and harassment. Homosexuality is punishable by up to 14 years in prison, and gay men and women have faced extortion, arrest, and physical torture under Mugabe’s rule.

Mugabe once said he was the “Hitler” of his time.

Animal Cruelty

Mugabe has a history of giving away or eating endangered animals, one of Zimbabwe’s most magnificent natural assets, to countries where the animals face certain death.

In 2010, ABC News revealed:

Conservationists and game wardens are alarmed that Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has ordered several wild animals, including baby elephants too young to leave their mothers, be sent to North Korea as a gift — and almost certain death. … In the 1980s Mugabe sent two rhinos, which are on the endangered species list, to North Korea. They died after only a few months there. Two other rhinos, sent to the Belgrade Zoo in the former Yugoslavia around the same period, also died.

Pressure by members of Mugabe’s government and international conservationists reportedly prompted the late dictator to cancel the shipment of wild animals to North Korea.

Much to the horror of conservationists, however, Mugabe slaughtered and served some of the country’s imperiled wildlife, including elephants and lions, during his lavish 91st birthday celebration in 20145.

Anti-White Racism Triggers Famine

In 2000, Mugabe launched a campaign to evict white farmers from their land and give it to black Zimbabweans, a move that led to famine.

“Our party must continue to strike fear in the heart of the white man, our real enemy,” Mugabe declared in 2002.

Mugabe’s henchmen attacked white farmers, killing many, setting their homes ablaze, looting their property, and confiscating their land. He had no plan to teach the farmers who replaced them how to maintain crop yields to feed the country.

As a result, the Zimbabwean economy descended into chaos with thousands of people suffering from poverty and near-starvation.

Referring to the eviction of white farmers, Metro reported Thursday:

The ‘Fast track land reform’ was meant to redistribute land from wealthy white farmers to black Zimbabweans who had suffered under minority rule, but the vast majority was given to the dictator’s henchmen and political supporters, leading to famine. White Zimbabweans had no citizenship rights to settle anywhere else in the world and lived in mortal fear of being murdered by members of Mugabe’s regime. Under his leadership, the economy of the mineral-rich country descended into chaos with thousands of people reduced to grinding poverty and near-starvation.

Corruption

Mugabe retained a firm grip over Zimbabwe for 37 years by rigging elections and crushing dissent.

Although he spent more than ten years in prison without trial as a political opponent of British rule, Mugabe cracked down on the opposition once he gained power.

On Thursday, the Washington Post reported:

Mr. Mugabe, as elected leader, characterized political opponents as “enemies,” freely used detention without trial and other emergency powers that he inherited from the white regime, and intimidated opponents in his drive for a one-party state.

Time added:

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Mugabe’s desire to be the supreme, unchallenged and lifetime leader of Zimbabwe birthed political violence, forced disappearances, tortures, rigged elections, corruption and an economy that collapsed multiple times in one generation, leaving millions desperately poor.

Mugabe also left behind a legacy of where free and fair do not apply to Zimbabwe’s elections.

The dictator also won 100,000 Zimbabwe dollars in a 2010 lottery partly ran by a state-owned bank. Moreover, anti-corruption investigators are investigating whether or not the dictator’s wife, former first lady Grace Mugabe, fraudulently obtained a doctorate from the University of Zimbabwe. The university awarded the doctorate within months."

However, many of his fellow tyrants considered him both a friend and ally.

As noted by Breitbart News, Mugabe’s 40-year leadership of the former British colony was “marked with bloodshed, persecution of political opponents, and vote-rigging on an industrial scale.” He also plunged the country, once one of the wealthiest in Africa, into an unprecedented economic disaster so severe that the government was forced to introduce a trillion-dollar note.

As it became clear to Western democracies that Mugabe was not the great colonial liberator he once promised to be, his country faced increasing international and economic isolation. However, Mugabe still managed to build relationships with some of the other most repressive regimes on earth.

Xi Jinping

The Chinese leader welcomed Mugabe to Beijing in 2011, describing him as an “old friend” of China and the “famed leader of the national liberation movement in Africa.”

Xi, who was at the time China’s vice president, outlined plans to expand farming, mining, and infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, a pledge he has since aggressively followed through as Beijing seeks to dominate the African continent through economic investment.

Ayatollah Khamenei

The Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei welcomed Mugabe to Tehran in 2012, praising his “brilliant record in fighting the western arrogant powers.”

“Around 25 years ago, when I was in Harare to attend the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, you stressed with the same revolutionary spirit that the member states of the movement only talk and that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the only country that acts,” Khamenei said at the time. “And now an opportunity has been provided for us to cooperate with each other and guide and call all the member states to taking action.”

For his part, Mugabe decried it as “extremely ridiculous that Westerners accuse Iran of trying to acquire nuclear weapons.” Four years later, Iran would sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement brokered by Barack Obama and other Western states in which the regime promised it would curb its development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

The Kim Dynasty

After assuming power in 1980, Mugabe struck up a rapport with communist dictator Kim Il-Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong-un who founded the modern Stalinist state. The pair reached an agreement where Pyongyang would train a wing of the Zimbabwean army, known as the Fifth Brigade, which Mugabe sought complete control as part of his bid to consolidate power in the country. The Fifth Brigade was responsible for the Gukurahundi genocide of the Ndebele people, which is believed to have resulted in at least 20,000 deaths.

In 2010, Mugabe sparked international outrage from animal welfare advocates and conservationists after sending a range of wild animals, including baby elephants too young to leave their mothers, to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il as a gift. As noted by ABC, the animals “faced almost certain death” as a result of trauma and the regime’s inability to fulfill their basic needs.

Castro’s Cuba

With the Castro regime long interested in pursuing relationships with African countries such as South Africa and Angola, Mugabe’s Zimbabwe was also a close ally of the regime. In 2007, state propaganda outlet Granma announced Cuba’s “solidarity with the people and government of Zimbabwe, the support for its struggle in defense of the most sacred and inalienable rights, and the absolute rejection of attempts to isolate that African country.”

Then-Vice President of Zimbabwe Joyce Teurai Ropa Mujuru “wished health and long life to Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, brother of struggles and dreams of President Mugabe.” Mugabe would end up outliving Fidel Castro by nearly three years.

Hugo Chávez

In 2004, the late socialist dictator Hugo Chávez praised Mugabe as a “freedom fighter” during a visit to Caracas, bestowing him with a replica of South American independence hero Simón Bolívar’s sword.

“For you, who like Bolivar, took up arms to liberate your people. For you, who like Bolivar, are and will always be a true freedom fighter,” Chávez said. “He continues, alongside his people, to confront the pretensions of new imperialists.”

In recent years, observers have drawn comparisons of Venezuela and Zimbabwe’s economic predicament, with both countries suffering similar problems such as shortages, hyperinflation, and the shame of having been transformed from prosperous and resource-rich countries to two of the world’s poorest nations.

His successor Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa confirmed the death on Twitter and offered his condolences.

He said: “Cde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace.”

It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe’s founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe (1/2) — President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) September 6, 2019

Cde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace (2/2) — President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) September 6, 2019

Many others will disagree with that sentiment, saying a man at first lauded as a genuine liberator of Africa eventually became a blood-soaked tyrant who took his country from the bread basket of Africa to basket case in one generation.

His 40-year leadership of the former British colony was marked with bloodshed, persecution of political opponents and vote-rigging on an industrial scale.

Mugabe’s lasting legacy was epitomised by British author Andrew Norman in his book, Robert Mugabe and the Betrayal of Zimbabwe. He wrote:

Instead of leading his people to the promised land, Mugabe on the one hand amassed a fortune for himself, his family and his followers and on the other hand presided over the deliberate murder, torture and starvation of those who opposed him. In short Mugabe betrayed his people.

Born on February 21, 1924, in what was then British-ruled Southern Rhodesia, the self-confessed Marxist was raised in a Catholic mission before becoming a school teacher.

He joined the National Democratic Party under Joshua Nkomo in its fight against the government of Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith, who had broken away from Britain in 1965 in an effort to prevent the introduction of black majority rule.

Mugabe was jailed for 10 years in 1964 for anti-government comments and on release in 1974 joined and later led the victorious guerrilla war conducted from Mozambique against Smith’s breakaway regime.

He rose through the ranks of the rebels to become the head of the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF)

As ZANU leader, he became prime minister of the new Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 and assumed the role of president seven years later.

In 2000 he led a campaign to evict white farmers from their land, which was given to black Zimbabweans, and led to famine.

Mugabe retained a strong grip on power, through allegations of vote-rigging elections on a monumental scale, until he was forced to resign in November 2017, at age 93.

His brutal record will live long after his name is forgotten.

Zimbabwean Senator David Coltart, who was once labelled “an enemy of the state” by Mugabe, said his legacy was marred by his adherence to violence as a political tool.

I’ve read several tweets stating that #RobertMugabe death is the end of an era. I beg to differ. Regrettably the negative aspects of his legacy – violence, disrespect for the rule of law, corruption & abuse of power – live on in the new regime which overthrew him in the 2017 coup — David Coltart (@DavidColtart) September 6, 2019

“He was always committed to violence, going all the way back to the 1960s… he was no Martin Luther King,” he told the BBC World Service. “He never changed in that regard.”

Mugabe had been receiving treatment in a hospital in Singapore since April when he died. His funeral arrangements have yet to be announced.

'Super Cereal' Blamed for Making Dozens Sick,"The World Food Program (WFP) for the second time this year stopped distributing a “nutritious porridge” known as “Super Cereal” across Uganda pending an investigation into food poisoning concerns, the Daily Monitor learned this week.

Until late last month, WFP continued to distribute the “Super Cereal” even after learning of a potential connection between illnesses — some fatal —and consumption of the porridge.

In an August 30 statement recently obtained by Uganda’s Daily Monitor and signed by Ryan Anderson, the food agency’s deputy director and officer-in-chargee in Uganda, WFP declared:

With immediate effect, the WFP is suspending the distribution of Super Cereal (CSB+) in all the nutrition’s programs in Uganda. This action is taken out of an abundance of cautions while a case of potential food contamination/ poisoning is investigated in Palabek settlement. The government and WFP are working closely together to determine whether there is a link between Super Cereal consumption and people falling sick.

On Tuesday, the Daily Monitor further revealed that “the [WFP] agency impounded more than 21,000 tonnes of the product, pending the outcome of safety tests.”

The recent decision to suspend the distribution of Super Cereal in Uganda is not without precedent.

In March, the U.N. agency reportedly halted the dispensation of the porridge after health officials linked the “Super Cereal” to the death of four people and making nearly 300 others sick.

“Health workers said that all patients presented symptoms of mental disorder after eating the flour,” the Daily Monitor pointed out, referring to WFP’s decision in March.

WFP reportedly began probing the matter following the four deaths.

Dr. Charles Akia Oyo, the health director in Lamwo District reportedly confirmed that officials admitted 33 people into the region’s health center after they consumed the porridge.

“We admitted 33 people from Palabek settlement camp, and we discharged them on Friday, and they are recovering,” he proclaimed.

Dr. Oyo noted that there are more people undergoing food poisoning examinations linked to Super Cereal at the health facility.

He indicated that “those admitted were vomiting and complained of stomach upsets.”

“The situation is calm, and there is no cause for alarm because we have not received any new cases since Saturday,” he proclaimed.

WFP is working on reducing the impact of the potentially tainted food supply, Brenda Akuruchet, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency, told the Daily Monitor.

“WFP is still working out what options are best and determining the best way forward to minimize the negative impact on activities,” she said.

John Komakech Ogwok, the Lamwo District chairperson, urged the government also to investigate the root cause of the health problems attributed to “Super Cereal.”"
1077,,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2019/09/05/pope-francis-urges-africans-to-take-up-the-weapons-of-peace/,2019-09-05T00:00:00,Pope Francis Urges Africans to Take up ‘the Weapons of Peace’,"Pope Francis encouraged Mozambique’s political leaders Thursday to employ the “weapons of peace” to continue the process of reconciliation in the strife-torn nation.

Addressing members of the government, parliament, and diplomatic corps, the pope said he spoke for the entire “international community” in thanking Mozambique’s leaders for “the efforts made in recent decades to ensure that peace is once more the norm, and reconciliation the best path to confront the difficulties and challenges that you face as a nation.”

On August 1, in fact, the President of the Republic of Mozambique, Filipe Nyusi, and the leader of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), Ossufo Momade, signed the Military Hostilities Cessation Accord.

The agreement officially called for laying down of arms and extended definitively a truce that has lasted since December 2016, after several years of armed clashes between government forces and those of RENAMO.

In his speech, the pope referred to this accord as a “landmark” that he hopes will prove decisive and a “further courageous step on the path of peace that began with the General Peace Agreement of 1992 in Rome.”

“How much has happened since the signing of the historic treaty that sealed the peace and has gradually begun to bear fruit!” Francis exclaimed. “Those first fruits sustain hope and the determination to make your future not one of conflict, but of the acknowledgement that you are all brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of a single land, stewards with a shared destiny.”

What is needed is the “genuine” courage that consists in the “tireless pursuit of the common good,” the pope said, rather than the “courage of brute force and violence.”

“You have experienced suffering, sorrow and affliction, but you have refused to let human relationships be governed by vengeance or repression, or to allow hatred and violence to have the final word,” he continued.

The pursuit of lasting peace calls for “strenuous, constant and unremitting effort,” he said, for peace is “like a delicate flower, struggling to blossom on the stony ground of violence.”

As he went on, the pope laid out what he sees as the foundations for a just and lasting peace, calling on Mozambique’s leaders to uphold the dignity of every one of its citizens.

“May you not desist as long as there are children and young people without schooling, families that are homeless, unemployed workers, farmers without land to cultivate,” he said.

“These are the foundations for a future of hope, because it will be a future of dignity! These are the weapons of peace,” he said.

The pope also underscored what he sees as the manifold fruits of peace, already evident in Mozambique society.

“Promising advances have been made in the fields of education and health care,” he said. “I encourage you to continue your efforts to build up the structures and institutions needed to ensure that no one feels abandoned, especially the young who make up so great a part of your country’s population.”

The young, he said, “are not only the hope of this land; they are also its present, a present that challenges, seeks out and needs to find worthy channels that can allow them to make good use of all of their talents. They have the potential to sow the seeds for the growth of that social harmony desired by all.”

The pope concluded by offering a prayer that his visit would help “make peace, reconciliation and hope reign definitively in your midst.”

Father Valentine Obinna, a priest of the Aba diocese in Nigeria, told the online Catholic news outlet Crux that the recent murders of priests and other Christians are not isolated events but are tied to a long-term program of the “Islamization of Nigeria.”

“It’s obvious. It’s underground. It’s trying to make the whole country a Muslim country,” Father Obinna said. “But they are trying to do that in a context with a strong presence of Christians, and that’s why it becomes very difficult for him,” he said, in reference to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.

The reason Christians have become targets is that Buhari and those in power “want to make sure the whole country becomes a Muslim country,” and they are using Boko Haram and the Fulani to achieve that objective, he said.

“People read the handwriting on the wall,” Obinna said.

In one of the most underreported stories of the year, Nigeria has seen rampant attacks on the Christian population of the country.

A recent report by the Jubilee Campaign asserted that 52 lethal, anti-Christian attacks took place in Nigeria during the first six months of 2019.

Meanwhile, the Nigerian-based International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law declared that some 2,400 Christians were killed by the Fulani in 2018 alone. And Nigeria’s Daily Post reported last year that from June 2015 to June 2018, Fulani militants “killed 8,800 Christians and other non-Muslims,” torching “not less than 1,000″ churches and other places of worship during the same period.

While mainstream media have insisted that the anti-Christian violence by Muslim herdsmen is not religiously motivated, that is not the experience of people on the ground, Allen notes.

“It’s tough to tell Nigerian Christians this isn’t a religious conflict since what they see are Fulani fighters clad entirely in black, chanting ‘Allahu Akbar!’ and screaming ‘Death to Christians,’” Sister Monica Chikwe of the Hospitaler Sisters of Mercy told journalist John L. Allen at a Rome conference this summer on anti-Christian persecution.

The secular media have largely downplayed the religious nature of the Fulani killings, preferring to attribute the violence to “ethnic tensions,” a “battle for land and resources,” or even “climate change.”

Nigeria’s President Buhari, who is himself of the Fulani ethnic group, has encouraged this narrative, minimizing the importance of religion in the conflict.

Others, however, concur with Father Obinna that a larger project is underway.

Two local Catholic bishops, for instance, have insisted that the violence represents a “clear agenda for Islamizing the Nigerian Middle Belt” by using armed Fulani jihadists as weapons.

One of the bishops, Matthew Ishaya Audu of Lafia, said in 2018 that the ongoing attacks are not random or economically motivated, but purposefully target Christians.

“They want to strike Christians,” Bishop Audu said, “and the government does nothing to stop them, because President Buhari is also of the Fulani ethnic group.”

Nigerian singer Tiwa Savage went even further, pulling out of a music festival in Johannesburg to protest “the barbaric butchering of my people.” Several other Nigerian entertainers and athletes followed suit.

Osinbajo and Savage were referring to a wave of xenophobic violence, vandalism, and looting perpetrated against migrants from other African nations to South Africa, which has long been a magnet for immigration thanks to its relatively prosperous economy.

The BBC reported at least five people have been killed and 189 arrested in the riots, which appear to have been prompted by resentment over migrants from other African nations taking too many jobs in South Africa, as well as making the drug and crime situation worse. Two major inciting incidents were a nationwide strike on Sunday by South African truckers who said foreign drivers were taking their jobs, and the shooting death of a Pretoria taxi driver last week after he confronted foreigners suspected of selling drugs.

The unpleasantness in South Africa extends into cyberspace, as foreigners report receiving text messages and videos threatening them with violence, depicting people killed by mobs, threatening disruptive actions, or spreading hysteria with false reports of crimes. A fake social media story about schools burning and children getting kidnapped caused many parents to keep their children home on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Many migrants to South Africa are from Nigeria, where increasingly angry critics see the response of the South African government as unforgivably lax. After getting slammed for days over his silence, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke out against the violence for the first time in a video released on Tuesday and a public appearance on Wednesday morning.

“As much as they have certain grievances, taking action against people from other nations is not justified and should never be allowed in our beautiful country. South Africa is a home for all,” Ramaphosa said on Wednesday.

“We know that there are quite a number of foreign people who come to our country and we should make sure that we live side by side with them,” he said, adding that South Africans should not “take the law into our own hands and attack those people” when there are “problems of criminality.”

Some other South African officials have described the violence as purely criminal in nature, such as Police Minister General Bheki Cele, who said on Wednesday that “xenophobia is just an excuse to commit criminal acts.”

Cele’s Deputy Minister of Police, Bongani Mkongi, unhelpfully added a complaint that “South Africans have surrendered their own cities to foreign nationals” and insisted it was “not xenophobia to talk truth.”

A wave of reciprocal violence struck South African businesses in Nigeria and Zambia on Tuesday and Wednesday, forcing some major South African retail chains to close their stores. The Nigerian government announced it would boycott the World Economic Forum meeting in Cape Town and may recall its high commissioner from Pretoria to protest the Ramaphosa administration’s handling of the mob attacks.

The presidents of Rwanda and Malawi also withdrew from the WEF conference, while Ethiopia and Kenya issued statements condemning the violence in South Africa. Zambia called off a much-anticipated soccer match with South Africa on Wednesday to protest the xenophobic violence. The African Union on Wednesday condemned the violence and vandalism, calling for further South African government action to restore order.

It is not actually clear if any of the people injured or killed in the South African riots are Nigerian. Tiwa Savage amended her comment about the “barbaric butchering of my people” to indicate she regarded all Africans as “her people.”"
1080,,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/03/american-workers-to-protest-angolan-delegations-visits-to-d-c-new-york-over-african-nations-targeting-u-s-companies/,2019-09-03T00:00:00,"American Workers to Protest Angolan Delegation’s Visits to D.C., New York","Some American workers are planning to protest the Angolan government’s delegation’s planned upcoming visits this month to New York City and Washington, DC, Breitbart News has learned.

With a focus on the African nation’s refusal to pay obligations owed to a variety of U.S. companies who do business in Angola, and the government’s use of armed uniformed soldiers to seize one U.S. company’s assets in the country at gunpoint, the protests are likely to draw attention to senior Angolan officials traveling to D.C. and New York for meetings with senior officials in President Donald Trump’s administration and for the United Nations General Assembly this month.

A source with knowledge said that the D.C. protest may be planned for in front of the White House, but a representative for Africa Growth Corporation (AFGC)—the company whose assets were seized at gunpoint by uniformed Angolan soldiers, as Breitbart News reported earlier this year—declined to comment on such specifics because of concern for safety of the company’s employees.

“This is America. Our employees and their families are free to exercise their First Amendment rights as they see fit,” an AFGC spokesperson said. “While we are not involved in whatever protests are planned, we certainly understand their frustration with the Angolan government’s unlawful conduct and the U.S. State Department’s refusal to protect US interests in Angola.”

The exact times and locations of the protests are unclear at this point, and organizers have not yet disclosed them for safety reasons given the Angolan government’s clear willingness to use military force and aggression even against Americans.

“We live in fear for our lives,” said one source familiar with the effort who has ongoing business operations in both Angola and here in the United States.

These protests will come as American workers are furious that the Angolan government has still not paid obligations owed to a number of U.S. companies—in the tens of millions of dollars worth—as Breitbart News reported early in July in an explosive investigation. The report uncovered how Angola, rather than paying American companies what it owes them, has instead taken millions of dollars to hire a Washington, DC, lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs to represent its interests in the U.S. This also comes as the U.S. pours tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer aid into Angola annually.

In August, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with his Angolan counterpart in Washington, DC, when the Angolan foreign minister Manuel Augusto was here in the United States.

“Secretary Michael R. Pompeo met today with Angolan Foreign Minister Manuel Augusto in Washington, D.C.,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement about the meeting. “The Secretary reaffirmed the strength of the U.S.-Angola strategic partnership and welcomed the bold reforms that President João Lourenço has undertaken since taking office in 2017. The two conferred on ways to increase bilateral trade and investment and strengthen democratic institutions.”

The State Department has not answered multiple follow-up requests for comment from Breitbart News on specifically whether Pompeo breached the subject of Angola still refusing to pay tens of millions of dollars in debts owed to U.S. companies, including AFGC. It is also unclear whether Pompeo and Augusto discussed whether the U.S. thinks it is acceptable for Angola to seize a U.S. company’s assets with armed uniformed military soldiers at gunpoint.

A State Department official originally told Breitbart News that the United States government is aware of the problem and has pressured Angola on the matter.

“Promoting U.S. trade and investment is one of our highest foreign policy priorities in Africa, and the United States engages robustly to advance U.S. commercial interests and to support U.S. companies by providing a range of trade and investment support services,” the State Department official said back in early July. “American companies have been present in the Angolan market for more than 50 years and are among the largest foreign investors in Angola. Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in sub-Saharan Africa with bilateral goods trade valued at 3.28 billion dollars in 2018. The U.S. Government, through Embassy officials and various high-level visitors, has raised the African Growth Corporation’s case at many levels with the Government of Angola, including directly with the President on more than one occasion. U.S. companies investing in Angola seek a level playing field, predictable policies, and a dispute resolution process that follows the rule of law. We continue to encourage the Government of Angola to increase transparency and fairness in its business environment. Due to ongoing litigation, we have no further comment.”

But lack of action from the State Department on this front has drawn the ire of other parts of the Trump administration. As Breitbart News reported in August, the White House and Treasury Department are considering taking steps of their own including and up to economic sanctions against Angola to force the government there to pay its obligations."

Chibok became world-famous after the jihadist group raided the village in 2014 and abducted 276 schoolgirls from the local secondary school during an annual exam. Over 100 girls remain missing more than five years after the attack, and a significant percentage of those who survived were not rescued but escaped on their own.

The Nigerian government has repeatedly claimed it has defeated Boko Haram and that the group no longer exists. When confronted by repeated Boko Haram attacks and the fact that hundreds of people abducted by the terrorists are still missing, Abuja contends that the terrorists currently active are members of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), an offshoot of the original Boko Haram.

Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015.

The jihadist terrorists “sacked community members, destroyed and set houses on fire” in Chibok this weekend, according to Nigeria’s Vanguard newspaper. This Day, another newspaper, cited eyewitnesses who said the assault began late Saturday. Due to the remote location of many Boko Haram attacks, it often takes days for news of an attack to get to the general public.

“They came in this evening and started shooting sporadically. Most of the villagers have run into the bush,” an unnamed “source” told This Day. “We don’t know if there are casualty [sic] yet because right now the insurgents are still in charge of the village.”

“Reports coming from Yimirmugza, Kautikari in Chibok LGA indicates that houses were burnt, stores broken provisions looted, cars burnt and people injured,” Mallam Abga Pogu, an elder statesman in the village, told Vanguard. The newspaper noted that the terrorists did not appear to have injured anyone in the village as “most panicking residents have fled into the bush for safety.”

Borno is located in Nigeria’s northeast, near the dense and vast Sambisa Forest and consisting largely of undeveloped “bush” territory. Boko Haram was born in Borno’s capital, Maiduguri, and has historically taken advantage of the Sambisa Forest and difficult terrain to hide from police and the Nigerian military.

Chibok observed the fifth anniversary of the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls from the town in April. Current President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim ethnic Fulani from the country’s north, won the presidency in 2015, and re-election this year, largely by campaigning that his military dictator background could help eradicate the Boko Haram threat. In 2016, Buhari approved the trade of four senior Boko Haram jihadis for 21 Chibok girls, who the group released immediately. Some of the released terrorists have since returned to violence.

The trade did not stop Boko Haram terrorists from repeatedly attacking Chibok after the abductions.

Buhari began claiming that Nigeria “won the war” against Boko Haram in 2015, before he approved liberating multiple senior terrorists. A month before the 2016 Chibok raid, Nigerian military spokesman Col. Sani Usman told reporters, “We have come to the point that we can beat our chest and decisively say we have dealt with Boko Haram.”

Nigerian officials made similar statements every year of Buhari’s presidency and continue to do so today. In light of the extended Boko Haram onslaught in the northeast, however, officials have now begun claiming that Boko Haram no longer exists.

Nigerian Army chief of staff Tukur Buratai told reporters in June “that what is currently playing out in the North-east is the metamorphosis of ISWAP [Islamic State West Africa Province],” not the indigenous Boko Haram. ISWAP, Buratai asserted, was made up of foreign jihadists looking for a home for their activities.

“The position of the Nigerian government is that the Boko Haram terrorism has been degraded and defeated. The real Boko Haram we know is defeated,” Buhari spokesman Garba Shehu said in August. “What we have now is a mixture of remnants of the Boko Haram, fugitive criminals…[and jihadis in Northern Africa’s Maghreb reigon] together with West African terrorists bonding together.”

Shortly after this declaration, Boko Haram seized two more Borno towns and setting them on fire, gathering food and supplies to continue attacking the government.

Critics of the Buhari government have accused Abuja of worsening the jihadist onslaught by doing little to fight corruption in the military and contain the influence of jihadist groups.

“The security situation has even worsened if we look at the general overview. APC [Buhari’s party] came into power in 2015 with the promise that Boko Haram would be a forgone story. Today, it’s a different ball game,” Bitrus Pogu, the National Chairman of the Middle Belt Forum, said this week. Nigeria’s Middle Belt connects the Muslim north to the Christian south and as such is home to another jihadist conflict, the Fulani herdsmen campaign to eradicate Christian farmers.

“On and on we find Boko Haram running over our military formations, taking our military equipment away,” Pogu said. “I believe if the government has the will, these girls (Chibok) will be released. … We believe the government can do better, let’s forget about the politics and do what is needful.”

Boko Haram is believed to have killed at least 35,000 people in the past decade and used 3,500 children as child soldiers and suicide bombers.

1082,,http://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/09/25/placido-domingo-withdraws-from-met-opera-after-sexual-harassment-allegations/,2019-09-25T00:00:00,Plácido Domingo Withdraws from Met Opera After Sexual Harassment Allegations,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Metropolitan Opera announced Tuesday that Plácido Domingo had agreed to withdraw from his slate of scheduled performances at the opera house following allegations of sexual harassment made by multiple women in two Associated Press stories. The opera legend indicated that he would never again perform at the Met.

Domingo had been scheduled to sing the title role in the season premiere of Verdi’s “Macbeth” on Wednesday night, which would have been his first performance in the United States since the AP reported that numerous women had accused him of inappropriate behavior, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast.

The Met had been under increasing pressure to cancel Domingo’s appearances, but general manager Peter Gelb reiterated to performers after a dress rehearsal Saturday that the opera house was awaiting results of investigations by the LA Opera, where Domingo has been general director since 2003, and the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union that represents various opera staff.

Full Coverage: Placido Domingo

Domingo, who had sung in rehearsals, issued a statement saying his Met career was over after what the company said was 706 performances as a singer, plus 169 as a conductor.

“I made my debut at the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 27 and have sung at this magnificent theater for 51 consecutive, glorious years,” the star said. “While I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection, I believe that my appearance in this production of ‘Macbeth’ would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both on stage and behind the scenes.

“As a result, I have asked to withdraw,” he added, “and I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request. I am happy that, at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of ‘Macbeth,’ which I consider my last performance on the Met stage.”

In its statement, the Met said the long-married, Spanish-born superstar had “agreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately.”

Gelb sent an email to the Met staff saying, “We are grateful to him for recognizing that he needed to step down.”

The Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera previously canceled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published. But his reception has been far different in Europe, where he received lengthy ovations after concert performances of Verdi’s “Luisa Miller” at the Salzburg Festival in Austria on Aug. 25 and 31, just weeks after the initial AP story.

Angela Turner Wilson, the singer who allowed the AP to use her name in accusing Domingo of grabbing her breast, said she was “relieved” by the Met’s action, but criticized Gelb for previously asserting that the opera house could not act without corroborated evidence and that all of Domingo’s accusers were anonymous. She called Gelb’s remarks “a major concern to me and many others who wish to see the current culture of sexual harassment and retaliation removed from our industry. It is time.”

Another of Domingo’s accusers, Patricia Wulf, also called the withdrawal a relief.

“I feel like we accomplished something,” said Wulf, who accused Domingo of repeatedly harassing her during performances at Washington Opera in the late 1990s, while he was general director of the company.

“The Met finally stepped up and did the right thing,” she told the AP.

In addition to announcing Domingo’s withdrawal, Gelb said the Met was suspending tenor Vittorio Grigolo pending the outcome of an investigation opened Tuesday by The Royal Opera in London, which said he was alleged to be involved in a Sept. 18 incident when he sang the title role in Gounod’s “Faust” on tour in Tokyo.

Grigolo, 42, was scheduled to sing six performances of Alfredo in Verdi’s “La Traviata” at the Met in February and March. He did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The Met fired conductor James Levine in March 2018 after an investigation by a law firm retained by the company found evidence of sexual abuse and harassment. Levine, the company’s music director from 1976-2016, was music director emeritus at the time and denied the allegations. He filed a breach of contract and defamation lawsuit that was settled last month.

Domingo made his Met debut in September 1968 and is known to many beyond opera for his performances as part of The Three Tenors with Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras. Singing far beyond the retirement age of most singers, he shifted to baritone parts in 2009, extending his repertoire to more than 150 roles. He sang 21 opening nights at the Met, breaking Enrico Caruso’s previous record of 17.

Domingo’s next scheduled performance is in Verdi’s “Nabucco” at the Zurich Opera on Oct. 13. He is not slated to sing in the U.S. until Donizetti’s “Roberto Devereux” at the LA Opera, which opens Feb. 22.

Zeljko Lucic, originally scheduled for later in the run, will replace Domingo and sing all six performance of “Macbeth” at the Met. Domingo also had been scheduled for four performances as Sharpless in Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly” at the Met in November.

Outside the Met entrance Tuesday night, a poster advertising the “Macbeth” production had Domingo’s name whited out, with the name of his replacement covering it.

Cathy Soderquist, a retired U.S. government employee from Washington who planned to see “Macbeth” on Wednesday, called the Met’s action an overreaction in the ”#MeToo era.” ″Too many allegations are coming in and people are being accused and penalized,” she said. “I mean, he’s being accused, but he hasn’t been prosecuted. He hasn’t gone to court.”

Said her husband, Dick Soderquist, “Europeans are kind of laughing at us.”

Before Domingo’s withdrawal, the New York state senator whose district includes the opera house had called for his removal.

“I believe they have an obligation to hold their performers to a high standard, given the fact that they are one of the world’s most important cultural institutions,” said Brad Hoylman, a Democrat. “They should be thinking also not just about his celebrity and star power, but about the 20 women who allegedly have made complaints. The Met has an obligation to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees and I’m concerned that if they don’t take action on this, this matter might discourage future employees from coming forward.”"

Won’t Screen ‘Joker’ at Aurora Theater After ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Shooting,"Warner Bros. will not show The Joker in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater where a deadly mass shooting occurred during the premiere of the Batman sequel, The Dark Knight Rises in 2012.

According to Deadline, it was a decision made jointly by theater chain Cinemark and the studio.

The Joker is a dark tale of violence and madness, stripped of the character’s more comic bookish characteristics, set in a real-world Gotham City during the 1970s. It appears that the violence inherent in the film has Warner Bros. and the theater chain worried that a copycat shooting could occur. Those worries also extended to some of the family members who lost loved ones during the 2012 shooting.

Jessica Ghawi, Alexander J. Boik, Ashley Moser, and Tiina Coon signed an open letter to Warner Bros. saying that they are wary of the new film and the violence in it. In part, the group said, “when we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called Joker that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story.”

The shooting victims’ family members did not make any specific demands on the distribution of the film, only saying, “we’re calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.”

One of the signatories, Sandy Phillips, who lost her 19-year-old daughter, Jessica Ghawi, criticized Joker, saying “I don’t need to see a picture of [the killer Holmes]; I just need to see a Joker promo, and I see a picture of the killer.”

“My worry is that one person who may be out there — and who knows if it is just one — who is on the edge, who is wanting to be a mass shooter, may be encouraged by this movie. And that terrifies me,” Phillips added in an interview.

However, the group did demand that the studio refrain from donating money to any political candidate or cause that takes donations from or cooperates with the National Rifle Association.

The letter, as posted by Variety, continues:

End political contributions to candidates who take money from the NRA and vote against gun reform. These lawmakers are literally putting your customers and employees in danger. Use your political clout and leverage in Congress to actively lobby for gun reform. Keeping everyone safe should be a top corporate priority for Warner Brothers. Help fund survivor funds and gun violence intervention programs to help survivors of gun violence and to reduce every-day gun violence in the communities you serve. Since the federal government has failed to pass reforms that raise the standard for gun ownership in America, large companies like Warner Brothers have a responsibility to act. We certainly hope that you do.

Despite the exhortations, it appears that the group does not represent the bulk of the families of other victims. Many other family members apparently refused to sign onto the letter.

Joker director Todd Phillips said fears of violence over the film are being overblown and that people can understand and handle the context of his critically acclaimed movie.

“The movie makes statements about a lack of love, childhood trauma, lack of compassion in the world. I think people can handle that message,” Phillips told the media. “It’s so, to me, bizarre when people say, ‘Oh, well I could handle it. But imagine if you can’t.’ It’s making judgments for other people and I don’t even want to bring up the movies in the past that they’ve said this about because it’s shocking and embarrassing when you go, oh my God, Do the Right Thing, they said that about [that movie, too].”

For her second day in Manhattan, Melania Trump wore a soft ecru belted wool-crepe coat by Gucci from the Pre-Fall 2019 Collection. The 1970s-inspired coat — with its giant front pockets, pleated cuffed sleeves, and oversized collar — features the brand’s iconic plastic interlocking “GG” belt.

The belt, worn in a shade of green by Lana Del Rey in Gucci’s latest perfume ad campaign, has become an instantly recognizable piece that is arguably one of fashion’s most coveted items at the moment. The Gucci coat retails for about $4,000.

Mrs. Trump, as well as her personal couturier Hervé Pierre, is seemingly drawn towards the 1960s and 1970s for style inspiration.

Not only has she worn mod Gucci coats in the past (Remember the pale yellow butterfly coat she wore to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin?!), but her visit to the New York Stock Exchange yesterday saw her channel Catherine Deneuve in the 1967 film Belle de Jour, wearing a pair of Roger Vivier buckle pumps.

Host Lawerence Jones asked, “There’s been this circulating question: Are black people leaving the Democratic Party? To which you respond?”

Johnson said, “No. Well, it’s not even a matter of if they’re leaving the Democratic Party. It’s a matter of, is there a change in the ideology? And that’s what I believe we’re heading towards. We’re heading towards a vacuum in the black community, where there is no trust for the Republican Party. There is no trust for conservative principles. But they’re also starting to see Democrats clearly. So they’re also starting to see ‘The Progressive’ clearly and understand that they’re not going to be bringing them any tangibles home as well.

She added, “My biggest fear is that democratic socialism is going to come in and fill that vacuum when capitalism and conservatism should be in that place.”

“In the book I detail a New York City public health study that said between 2012 and 2016 more black pregnancies ended in abortion than live birth,” Hudson said. “I do detail the history of Planned Parenthood, and Margrett Sanger, a eugenist, who wrote many times about the extermination of black people.”



“We’re talking about 4 percent of the population — that is black childbearing-aged women — accounting for 35 percent of the abortions,” Hudson revealed. “If you couple the history of Planned Parenthood and the fact that a majority of their abortion clinics are located within walking distance of black and Hispanic neighborhoods, I don’t think it’s unfair to say that the political Left and Democrats and Hollywood radicals are on the same side as white supremacists on the issue of abortion.”

“As a conservative who happens to be black, we are the ones fighting and screaming and supporting states like Georgia, that are daring to pass laws that aim to protect the black unborn,” Hudson continued. “It’s a shame that you don’t see Black Lives Matter picketing in front of Planned Parenthood clinics, which are at the heart of this war going on in the womb, particularly in black America.”

Hudson also called out the left for their failed Affirmative Action policies.

“I write about affirmative action and it has been an unmitigated disaster for about 40 years. It turns out that fixing the problem of minorities not being admitted to college campuses has actually failed. There are now fewer black and Hispanic students on the top college campus in America since before affirmative action was implemented,” Hudson said.

“In the book, I dive deeply and celebrate all of the many educational accomplishments that blacks have made in this country,” Hudson continued. “About 30 years after blacks were freed after the Civil War, literacy rates for blacks in America went from 20 percent to 70 percent and black students were graduating from Ivy League schools like Harvard as early as 1903. Fifty years before the civil rights movement began, blacks in this country were achieving magnificent educational achievements.”

“Affirmative action isn’t racism, but it certainly feels like racism. In the book, I make the point that we have to be either an America that sets one standard for people based on the color of their skin or a country that holds one standard for everyone under the law. What affirmative action does is set a different standard for people just based on the accident of their birth. And that in many ways isn’t fair.”

“#DWTS not watching you this year putting somebody like Sean Spicer on your show is an insult to the American people”

“I want him to go back to his cocaine and hookers and get off my television. #DWTS is a disgrace for having him on. I tape the show and fast forward past him and Sean Spicer.”

“These “party over country” people have gone too fucking far. Voting to keep Sean Spicer on #DWTS ?? Absolutely shameful.”

“Sean Spicer? I’ll never again watch this show. #DWTS”

“But as we’ve all see with Sean “DWTS” Spicer, and Sarah “I’m now a Fox “News” Employee” Huckabee Sanders, they’re not being black balled as they should be.”

“Here’s your weekly reminder. Fuck Sean Spicer and the people who thought profiting off of his shittiness was a great idea. You took my favorite show away from me. #DWTS”

“Ugh. I’m watching DWTS as I grade and why is Sean #Nazi Spicer getting votes? #trumpsters”

Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday that he views his participation in DWTS as an opportunity to send a message to the Hollywood elites who typically snub right-leaning Americans.

“Hollywood largely shuns folks on the right. This is an opportunity to show that we’re human beings. We’re good people. We care about the country, that we’re out there,” Spicer said.

“And hopefully, it sends the message – especially if people get out there and vote – it really lets them know that there are people out there that aren’t just on the left that watch television and care about those causes– that you know people on both sides of the aisle are good people, that we care about this country and we can’t just shun one side of the political aisle,” he continued.

“I hope our side gets engaged out there and really, really sends a message that everybody deserves to go out and enjoy shows and have fun and that’s what the show’s all about,” he added.

Last week, Spicer released a lighthearted video, pledging to stand up for Americans “forgotten” due to their “lack [of] rhythm and moves.”

“For 28 years Dancing with the Stars has had plenty of great dancers full of rhythm and moves. This fall, let’s finally vote for someone who represents people like us,” the narrator stated in the video.

Begun a decade ago, his chronicle of a slave with an extraordinary memory who joins the Underground Railroad is the result of countless drafts, a shift from multiple narrators to a single voice, some needed advice from fellow writers and hundreds of thousands of words discarded. Coates’ research ranged from reading interviews with ex-slaves and consulting a 19th-century Farmer’s Almanac — books duly pictured on his Instagram account — to his numerous and revelatory visits to former plantations.

And then came that call from Oprah Winfrey.

“I was just as surprised as anybody. I pretty much write for myself and the only people I think about are my wife and my editor,” says Coates, whose novel is her latest book club pick. “I was really happy (about the news from Winfrey). But I think the most encouraging part was that she’s a reader. It was clear from the conversation that she’s a reader. This is not a marketing ploy. There’s nothing to be cynical about.”

Winfrey announced Monday that she chose “The Water Dancer” to formally begin her new book club partnership with Apple, for which she plans a selection every other month. In October, she will interview Coates before a live audience at Apple Carnegie Library in Washington, D.C., a conversation that will air Nov. 1 on Apple TV Plus, the new streaming service. During a recent telephone interview with The Associated Press, Winfrey became tearful as she described the novel’s emotional impact, how it captured the devastation and resilience of those enslaved.

.@Oprah reveals she was asked to moderate a 2020 debate and responds to the talk of her running in 2020: “I never seriously considered… It’s the kind of thing you feel in your gut, your soul… You know if that is the thing you’re supposed to do in your life.” pic.twitter.com/vYkNOEc0S7 — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) September 23, 2019

“I have not felt this way about a book since ‘Beloved,’” Winfrey said of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by her friend and literary idol Toni Morrison, who died in August.

The 43-year-old Coates spoke to The Associated Press during a recent afternoon at a SoHo cafe, where he drank strong iced coffee and received the occasional greeting from a friend or fellow customer. He said that he began the novel after completing his first book, the memoir “The Beautiful Struggle,” and acting on editor Chris Jackson’s suggestion that he try fiction. Jackson told the AP in a recent statement that “The Beautiful Struggle” demonstrated Coates’ “ability to dive so deeply and imaginatively into a character’s interior life and invent an idiom to tell the story that was more Joyce-ian than journalistic.” Coates, who had been reading extensively about the Civil War at the time, wanted to open readers to the “inner lives of enslaved black folks,” a “thriller” that would also dramatize the most profound questions of freedom and identity.

He worked off and on over the next few years on “The Water Dancer,” while honing a literary voice — of realism and poetry, outrage and exploration — that Morrison would liken to James Baldwin’s. As a national correspondent for The Atlantic, he wrote a highly influential and debated piece on reparations for blacks. He received a Hugo nomination for his contribution to the newly launched Black Panther comics series, “A Nation Under Our Feet.” In 2015, he published “Between the World and Me,” a letter to his son about being black in the United States that won the National Book Award, topped The New York Times best-seller list and helped confirm his status as one of the country’s leading social commentators.

“It wasn’t really that difficult,” he said of finding time for his novel. “I really liked writing ‘The Water Dancer.’ It was like I get to go play again.”

Winfrey’s original book club was started in 1996. She has since helped turn dozens of books into best-sellers, from novels by William Faulkner to a memoir by Sidney Poitier. For “The Water Dancer” and her upcoming choices, Apple has pledged that for each copy purchased through Apple Books, it will make a contribution to the American Library Association to support local libraries.

Over the past few years, Winfrey’s choices haven’t had the impact they did when she had her syndicated television program. But her announcement of “The Water Dancer” had some of the old magic: By Monday night, the novel was No. 1 on the Apple bookstore and Amazon.com best-seller lists.

Winfrey said she was wary at first of “The Water Dancer,” if only because she found Coates such a “beautiful essayist” and wondered if he could move beyond the factual world. Journalists from George Orwell to Tom Wolfe have found success as novelists, but the switch from nonfiction to fiction can frustrate the most gifted writer. Nonfiction doesn’t only require adherence to the truth, but a kind of control over the narrative that the fiction writer has to surrender, at least in part. Novelists often speak of their stories becoming so real to them that a given character might lead them in a direction they hadn’t otherwise intended. Coates felt that with the protagonist of “The Water Dancer,” Hiram Walker, who did not start out at the center of the story, or even with the name Hiram.

“I really liked his story, and I said, ‘This is it,’” Coates explained.

While working on the book, Coates showed early drafts to peers such as novelist Michael Chabon, who suggested he “paint the whole scene,” Coates recalls, tell everything from how the sunlight looks in the trees to the smell of the air. “The Water Dancer” combines the most everyday details and the freest stretches of imagination, from the supernatural quality of Hiram’s mind to his encounters with historical figures such as the abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Coates’ favorite authors include E.L. Doctorow, known for mixing real and fictional people in such historical novels as “Ragtime,” and Morrison.

“She just had this mastery of the sentence,” Coates said of the late Nobel laureate. “She had a beautiful economy of words. I don’t that mean that in the sense that she was a sparse writer; she filled every sentence with so much emotion and feeling and information — visceral information, literary information. She wrote the way poets write. I took that from her early on.”

Coates, who says he has many ideas for another novel, left The Atlantic in 2018 and has no plans to resume his journalistic career. But even while working on fiction, he was reminded of the importance of reporting and the difference between reading about a subject and absorbing it on sight, how “you have to be there in order to feel it, in a way you can’t through books.” Coates cited the importance of actually standing on plantations and Civil War battlefields, notably a trip last year to Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s home in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“The house is beautiful, stunning, gorgeous — and it was enslaved people who built it,” he says. “There’s a tunnel under Monticello that enslaved people walked through. When I walked through that tunnel, it was like, ‘Man, I get it now.’ I could see so much. I could feel my people talking to me at that point. I could feel it. But that was after 10 years of work. I don’t know how it happens without that.”"

According to the marketing manager who rented the event venue, nearly 4,000 people showed up to take part in the free, hour-long service with West.

“It was a very spur of the moment thing for literally everyone,” said Levi Meyer, PR and marketing manager for the BBCW. “With that in mind and thinking about how big the turnout really was, that just shows how much people wanted to see a special event like this.”

Meyer, who was raised in Cody, also spoke on the politeness of the crowd, saying “The whole crowd was so positive and polite. I have never heard a musical sound so big in Cody, Wyoming. It was unbelievable.”

Meyer added, “People came a long ways to see this. It really brought in a new crowd to Cody and the museum.”

According to an event Instagram account, a choir, with an estimated 8o singers, flew in from Burbank, California, to attend and perform at the event.

The choir, which was lead by director Jason White, congregated in a grassy area and were later joined by West and others.

In regards to future events, Meyer said it is unclear when, or if, there will be another event in Cody in the future.

“I don’t think I can say either way … It’s really hard to tell,” Meyer stated.

Earlier this month, West held a “Sunday Service” event in Chicago, Illinois, which was also attended by fellow Chicago crooner Chance the Rapper."

“This is all wrong I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?” Thunberg said in her United Nation speech.”

“You have stolen my dreams, my childhood, with your empty words and yet I’m one of the lucky ones,” she continued. “People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?”

Thunberg was also one of 16 children from a dozen countries who filed a complaint with the United Nations, accusing five countries of failing to address climate change. The complaint was filed against Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey — but not China, which one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

The Hocus Pocus star spends a lot of time making far-left political pronouncements on Twitter. Just last week, for instance, she indulged the fantasy that pop singer Beyoncé’s large number of Instagram fans could band together and vote Trump out of office next November, even though a huge amount of her social media fans are under the voting age or aren’t U.S. citizens.

There is a long list of other such tweets. In July, for instance, Midler exclaimed that President Trump “rapes us all with impunity.” That same month, the singer also got in a bit of trouble for her racist exclamation that black voters who vote for Republicans are not smart enough to understand what they are doing. The month before that Midler was seen tweeting that she hoped the president would be stabbed to death. She deleted that tweet after another backlash.

Also, late last year, Midler was forced to apologize for body shaming First Lady Melania Trump.

In one of his trademark Twitter rants, Reiner warned that America’s Founding Fathers had “never anticipated” a president like Donald Trump.

“Our founding fathers never anticipated what we’re facing. A President who commits crimes on a daily basis,” the Princess Bride director said. “He was not held accountable for a foreign country helping him steal the last election. So he’s at it again. History will judge where we stand now. IMPEACH!”

Reiner is well known for his Twitter rants, which often involve foul language, bizarre claims, and demands for Trump’s impeachment. Earlier this month, he declared that “the Impeachment process is about to begin,” without offering any evidence or explanation for his claim.

“The articles drawn up will be voluminous,” Reiner said at the time. “Never in our nation’s history has there been a more lawless President. He has continually lied to the American people & has used the Presidency to line his pockets. GOP, history is watching.”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“Going to take a break from social media for a while and let me team run my accounts,” Ross tweeted Sunday.

The actor-activist hosted the LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, which featured all of the Democrat presidential candidates except Sanders.

The 38-year-old star spoke to the Guardian following the forum and criticized Sanders for skipping the event.

“I was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for,” Ross said. “You don’t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That’s obviously telling us all we need to know.”

The Pose actor claimed access to inside information, which purportedly revealed that Sanders’ prior commitments included visiting historically black colleges and universities as well as an “old black barbershop”:

I’m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you’re on the campaign trail, what’s happening a lot – and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid – is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.

“Found out Bernie has a prior commitments to visit HBCUs in North Carolina and Prestige Barber College (a black barbershop) and will be touring the civil rights museum,” Ross tweeted last week, alongside a sarcastic GIF of The Office’s Michael Scott:

Ross told the Guardian that it is a struggle to “get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive”:

What I hope Bernie would learn is you don’t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I’m not here for any of the excuses. I say: ‘Make it up to me. Make it up to us.'”

Several social media users disagreed with the former model’s critique of Sanders.

“To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him,” one user wrote.

“I don’t think he skipped this forum because he doesn’t believe in equal rights for all,” another said.

“Except you decided to focus on one candidate who has the most robust background on this issue. Also, he was at a HBCU which was already scheduled. To think sanders is weak on LGBTQ is frankly laughable,” another added.

The backlash continued to escalate, leading Ross to announce a break from social media “for a while.”

This would not be the first time Sanders has experienced accusations of harassment and intimidation related to his supporters. Black leaders signed a letter last week, which detailed alleged “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. The alleged harassment followed the socialist senator’s loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement.

As Breitbart News reported:

A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. … The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.” “We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

Sanders followed up with a tweet, which read, “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House.”

Billy Porter, who made history merely by being nominated for his role as the exuberant ballroom emcee Pray Tell in FX’s Pose, a show that explores the “juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in New York: the rise of the luxury universe, the downtown social and literary scene and the ball culture world.”

In his acceptance speech, Porter said that he was “overjoyed” to win the award and believe that as a gay man he has the “right to be here”:

The category is love, you all. Love. I am so overwhelmed and I am so overjoyed to have lived long enough to see this day. James Baldwin said, “Took many years of vomiting up all the filth that I had been taught about myself and halfway believed before I could walk around this earth like I had the right to be here.” I have the right. You have the right. We all have the right.

Porter’s success was quickly seized upon by Biden, who claimed that he had inspired a young generation of actors.

“Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us,” Biden wrote. “You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you.”

Porter’s acting has been the source of widespread acclaim from critics following the show’s launch last year, in which his flamboyant character Pray Tell is diagnosed with HIV.

The 50-year-old actor is also known for his flamboyance in real life. At this year’s Oscars, Porter turned up on the red carpet wearing custom tuxedo dress as a tribute to Hector Xtravaganza, who passed away last year, from the House of Xtravaganza, known as one of New York City’s most famous underground ballroom houses.

On Friday, Ratajkowski — who frequently posts pictures of her private jet escapades — tweeted, “The problem is plastic straws it’s corporate greed #globalclimatestrike,” despite the fact that over “90 percent of the planet’s plastic waste comes Asia and Africa” and “straws in the United States account for about 0.03 percent of global plastic pollution,” as Breitbart News reported.

However, as of Monday morning, the tweet was unavailable. It remains unclear what prompted the left-wing activist to delete the message.

As Breitbart News noted, Ratajkowski has demonstrated a stunning ability to put her climate change concerns aside to boast of her excessive air travel on social media. For example, this month, Ratajkowski posted a series of pictures of herself, posing on private jets:

The I Feel Pretty actress is also an advocate of JetSmarter, which some have called the “Uber of air travel.”

“It’s the ‘first global digital marketplace for private aviation’ which makes booking flights on private jets a breeze for carbon footprint producing celebrities like Ratajkowski,” as Breitbart News reported.

This is not the first time a celebrity has demonstrated climate change hypocrisy. Over the summer, many high-profile guests drastically increased their CO2 emissions by flying across the globe to attend the “Google Summer Camp” to discuss climate change.

As Breitbart News reported:

Traditionally held every year at the end of July, the famed Verdura Resort hosts the top-secret gathering, with the three-day summer camp costing the tech giant some $20 million, sources told the Post. Many of the guests, including Obama and DiCaprio — who has his own climate change foundation — have described global warming as the biggest threat to future generations. Forbes reports numerous yachts are currently moored off the beach at Verdura Resort having discharged their passengers; German pharmaceutical titan Udo J. Vetter’s sailing yacht Aquarius, Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg’s sailing yacht EOS, Graeme Hart’s yacht Ulysses with others en route including David Geffen’s yacht Rising Sun, Google’s Eric Schmidt’s yacht Infinity and its support vessel Intrepid, among them. According to Italian press reports, the attendees were also expected to show up in 114 private jets, of which 40 had arrived by Sunday.

Over the weekend, 17 Democrat candidates – most of whom have deemed climate change an emergency – attended the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Iowa Saturday, which featured 10,500 steaks. Clips show the candidates dancing and even playing an active role in grilling steak, despite several of them expressing concern on beef consumption and its role in contributing to the “catastrophe”:

Ex-cop John Mark Dougan claims he has hundreds of hours of footage from the billionaire pedophile’s Palm Beach mansion.

But the Feds raided his home and collected all the information he had obtained about Esptein, prompting him to seek asylum in Russia to avoid arrest on suspicion of computer hacking.

“I’m certain the FBI is involved in some kind of cover-up over Epstein,” said Dougan. “That could absolutely include Andrew’s role, or it could be that senior FBI people visited the house and don’t want to reveal that.”

Dougan warned that he set up a dead man’s switch, encrypting all the files and endowing secret codes for them to friends all over the world as an insurance policy should he meet an untimely fate.

“The FBI got hold of all the data I have when they raided me,” Dougan said. “My copies of the files will never be released unless something untoward happens to me.”

“The Epstein files will stay secure and unreadable to everyone. I do not have a physical copy in my immediate possession, because of security reasons.”

“The files are safe and the people who hold them have no idea what is on them.”

Dougan added that he hasn’t surrendered the information to the Russian government in his quest for asylum.

“But I’m not a Kremlin agent and I did not share any materials with the Russian Government. I don’t intend to blackmail anyone with my information. It’s against my principles.”

Not long after Prince Andrew faced renewed scrutiny from Epstein’s arrest and subsequent “suicide” in August, the Buckingham Palace issued a statement strongly denying the Prince of Wales’ involvement in anything related to Epstein’s illegal activities.

“The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes,” the statement said.

“His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”

Ex-cop John Mark Dougan claims he has hundreds of hours of footage from the billionaire pedophile’s Palm Beach mansion.

But the Feds raided his home and collected all the information he had obtained about Esptein, prompting him to seek asylum in Russia to avoid arrest on suspicion of computer hacking.

“I’m certain the FBI is involved in some kind of cover-up over Epstein,” said Dougan. “That could absolutely include Andrew’s role, or it could be that senior FBI people visited the house and don’t want to reveal that.”

Dougan warned that he set up a dead man’s switch, encrypting all the files and endowing secret codes for them to friends all over the world as an insurance policy should he meet an untimely fate.

“The FBI got hold of all the data I have when they raided me,” Dougan said. “My copies of the files will never be released unless something untoward happens to me.”

“The Epstein files will stay secure and unreadable to everyone. I do not have a physical copy in my immediate possession, because of security reasons.”

“The files are safe and the people who hold them have no idea what is on them.”

Dougan added that he hasn’t surrendered the information to the Russian government in his quest for asylum.

“But I’m not a Kremlin agent and I did not share any materials with the Russian Government. I don’t intend to blackmail anyone with my information. It’s against my principles.”

Not long after Prince Andrew faced renewed scrutiny from Epstein’s arrest and subsequent “suicide” in August, the Buckingham Palace issued a statement strongly denying the Prince of Wales’ involvement in anything related to Epstein’s illegal activities.

“The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes,” the statement said.

“His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”

A survey conducted by DIK (Trade Union for Culture, Communication and Advertising) of over 4,700 librarians around the country has produced disturbing results, despite responses from only 34 percent of recipients.

""It is the third survey in a row that points to the same thing: Development is going in the wrong direction,"" SVT reports.

“In ‘Society is withdrawing - a report on the working environment in our libraries,’ 1,618 Swedish librarians tell of a bleak development in several areas. The biggest problem according to the respondents is social unrest, which has increased from 73 percent in 2017 to 81 percent of Swedish libraries today. Social unrest refers to fighting, intoxication, and aggressiveness towards staff or visitors.”

A majority of respondents reported encountering violent incidents multiple times per year, while 18 percent said it occurs every week and 4 percent said it takes place on a daily basis.

""It can be less threatening situations like throwing a book at someone, but in the worst cases, it is physical violence against librarians or visitors – in fact, abuse,"" said Stina Hamberg, head of social policy at DIK.

""Nobody should have to face these kinds of situations in their workplace,"" she said. ""Librarians are not trained for this, they work with reading promotion and information retrieval. Not dealing with drunk people, mentally ill or socially vulnerable people.""

Nearly half (47%) of respondents said that drug dealing has taken place in their libraries in the past two years.

Librarians also say it is common to encounter men surfing porn sites or openly masturbating at computers, and one in six say they have been subjected to sexual harassment.

One in five librarians say they have considered resigning or changing professions in the past two years.

Freddy McConnell was legally recognized as a male when she transitioned into becoming a male in 2017 and gave birth in 2018.

CNN reports, “The 32-year-old took legal action after a registrar told him that UK law required people who give birth to be registered as mothers on birth certificates.”

“This establishes the first legal definition of the term “mother” in English common law.”

“In ruling with the government, Andrew McFarlane, the president of the High Court’s family division, deemed that being a “mother” referred to being pregnant and giving birth, regardless of whether that person, in law, was a man or a woman.”

I’m saddened by the court’s decision not to allow trans men to be recorded as father or parent on their children's birth certificates. I fear this decision has distressing implications for many kinds of families. I will seek to appeal and give no more interviews at this stage. — Freddy McConnell (@freddymcconnell) September 25, 2019

Freddy’s trans pregnancy journey was filmed and turned into a documentary called “Seahorse,” because male Seahorses give birth to the babies instead of the females.

Time will tell if Freddy wins the appeal or not, but the judge did say the case “is an important matter of public interest and a proper cause for public debate.”

Defendants virally spread one of the worst smears that can be spread about anyone: accusing someone of one of the most infamous federal felony crimes, even though defendant knew Jones was actually the victim of that crime.”

The suit details how cybercriminals targeted Infowars and tried to plant child porn on Infowars servers in order to be produced during discovery in other legal matters, how the FBI’s investigation cleared Infowars and identified Jones as the targeted victim of the cyberattack, and how the defendants then lied to the world about what happened by falsely accusing the victim, Alex Jones, of being the perpetrator.

“For too long, the media feels it can tell any lie or libel about Alex Jones that it wants. Jones, as a strong advocate of both free press and free speech, resisted calls for suing those who continued to lie and libel him. But enough is enough. It is time to fight back.

However, the mainstream media like CNN and MSNBC are omitting that fact, instead falsely asserting that the “favor” Trump asked Zelensky was to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Even leftist print media like The Independent pushed the same lie in their article, “‘I would like you to do us a favour though’: The one sentence that could bring Trump down,” by hiding the follow-up sentence of Trump asking about the origins of the Russia witch hunt, and then gaslighting that he “essentially asked a foreign power that could eventually assist him in winning the 2020 election.”

“One day this man named George Soros came by and took Greta out of class. And I haven’t seen her since.”

Pointing out how Greta is now supported by the liberals who went after her, Mini AOC says she thinks the left is now OK with children being used to further a political agenda.

Commanders in Oklahoma in particular were given an intelligence memo that was later confirmed by the Texas Joint Crime Information Center, which initially issued the warning along with the FBI.

“The Fort Sill Criminal Investigation Division received an intelligence bulletin regarding a credible, potential mass shooting to occur at an unknown movie theater during the release of the new Joker movie scheduled on Oct. 4, 2019,” the memo states. “The intelligence bulletin was published by Travis County, Texas, Sheriff’s Office and, working with the local FBI field office, they have discovered disturbing and very specific chatter in the dark web regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the Joker release.”

In June, Air Force personnel were warned about potential violence by “incels,” men who are “involuntary celibate” due to their failure to attract women.

Two were described as being incels: Elliot Rodger, who killed six women in Isla Vista, Calif., in May 2014 in “retribution” for being rejected by females, and Alek Minassian who intended to spark an “incel rebellion” when he killed 10 people with a van in April 2018.

The upcoming “Joker” film is about the deranged Batman character whose mental breakdown leads him to a life of deranged violence.

“A shadow lurks at the edges of Joker’s promotional build-up, with critics expressing concern that the almost-sympathetic portrayal of Batman’s archenemy might inspire real violence, with some reviewers citing a parallel between the motivations of Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck and those of real-world ‘incels,’” reported CBR.com. “It’s important to ask, however, whether the concerns surrounding violence in Joker are warranted — and if they are, how likely the film is to inspire actual acts of violence.”

“…Joker wants audiences to sympathize with [the Joker] Arthur Fleck as it paints a picture of the sort of person who could become such a monster. What would drive a person to madness?”

“In this case, it’s mainly because Fleck lives a miserable, hollow existence,” the article added.

It’s been well documented how movies and other forms of entertainment can shape viewers’ attitudes and behavior.

“Media can have a real emotional impact on us,” stated an article by HowStuffWorks.com. If they didn’t, we wouldn’t have entertainment in the first place – anything you put in front of us would be greeted with waves of indifference.”

When it comes to influencing behavior, one study from 2012 found that “teens who watched a lot of simulated sex acts in movies were more likely to become sexually active.”

“The study examined over 700 popular Hollywood movies such as American Pie, American Beautyetc,” reported TheParentsZone.com. “Researchers found that teens who watched a lot of racy scenes from films tended to internalize what they watched and this influenced their sexual behavior because it gave them a rather skewed idea of what is considered ‘normal behavior.’”

The article considered “normal behavior” to include using protection, which is typically glossed over in love scenes.

If real-life incels can relate to the Joker character, it isn’t a stretch to suggest that they, too, might follow his lead in channeling their pent-up rage into acts of violence – which is what the memo is warning about.



Pulling from his deep research, Alex Jones laid out the real-life dangers of the film last week before the Pentagon even warned troops about the movie."

Commanders in Oklahoma in particular were given an intelligence memo that was later confirmed by the Texas Joint Crime Information Center, which initially issued the warning along with the FBI.

“The Fort Sill Criminal Investigation Division received an intelligence bulletin regarding a credible, potential mass shooting to occur at an unknown movie theater during the release of the new Joker movie scheduled on Oct. 4, 2019,” the memo states. “The intelligence bulletin was published by Travis County, Texas, Sheriff’s Office and, working with the local FBI field office, they have discovered disturbing and very specific chatter in the dark web regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the Joker release.”

In June, Air Force personnel were warned about potential violence by “incels,” men who are “involuntary celibate” due to their failure to attract women.

Two were described as being incels: Elliot Rodger, who killed six women in Isla Vista, Calif., in May 2014 in “retribution” for being rejected by females, and Alek Minassian who intended to spark an “incel rebellion” when he killed 10 people with a van in April 2018.

“Kids can customize the new dolls with long or short hair, pants or skirts, or both. The dolls come in six different skin tones,” reports Fox Business.

Kim Culmone, senior vice president of Mattel Fashion Doll Design, said the dolls were being released because “kids don’t want their toys dictated by gender norms.”

“Toys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,” she said.

This is all about social engineering. If @Mattel wanted to make a doll without defined private parts, totally fine, its been done many times and gives kids options. That’s not what’s going on here.

An ad for the new product featured a boy with purple hair and one who was wearing an earring.

Some respondents accused the company of trying to socially engineer kids, contributing to making them confused about gender.

“This is all about social engineering,” commented Robbie Starbuck. “If @Mattel wanted to make a doll without defined private parts, totally fine, its been done many times and gives kids options. That’s not what’s going on here. This is social engineering masquerading as a toy.”

One wonders how successful the new line will be.

“Get woke, go broke” is a common refrain, but the amount of free advertising any company enjoys by pandering to identity politics is usually substantial.

It all began with a man who held up a sign asking for beer money.

Carson King, 24, was seen at an Iowa State University football game earlier this month holding a humorous sign that read, “Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished,” along with the address to his Venmo digital wallet.

Carson King was joking when he held up a sign asking for beer money during a college football pre-game show. When cash started flowing into his Venmo account, the 24-year-old decided to donate it to a children's hospital.@kevtibs has the story. pic.twitter.com/cOuO0LcgDo — NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt (@NBCNightlyNews) September 19, 2019

King’s sign went viral. He soon raised hundreds, at which point he decided to donate the money (minus a case of beer) to a children’s charity.

“As word spread of his plans to donate the money, more people decided to contribute. Busch Beer and Venmo even caught wind of his plans, and raised the stakes by pledging to match his contribution,” CNN reported.

Busch even put Carson’s face and name on a can, dubbing him an “Iowa legend.”

Is it just me or is this can extremely good looking? I can’t be more humbled that @BuschBeer and @venmo are matching our contribution. We’re closing in on A Million for @UIchildrens #ForTheKids pic.twitter.com/Wuzil9Y1Qb — Carson King (@CarsonKing2) September 21, 2019

At this point, The Register decided to do a profile on King, during which reporter Aaron Calvin stumbled on some of King’s old social media posts which he brought to the attention of Register staff.

“Calvin found two racist jokes that King had posted on Twitter in 2012,” the newspaper explained in a statement from executive editor Carol Hunter Tuesday. “Calvin asked about them, and [King] expressed deep regret.”

A statement from our editor: pic.twitter.com/ZH9AhcrYbg — Des Moines Register (@DMRegister) September 25, 2019

Register staff mulled over whether to include King’s social media history in the profile, which they ultimately agreed was the right thing to do.

“Eventually, Register editors decided we would include the information, but at the bottom of the story. We thought we should be transparent about what we had found, but not highlight it at the top of the story or as a separate story. It was planned as a few paragraphs toward the bottom of the profile.”

But before they could put the story out, King beat them to the punch, announcing at a press conference attended by local media that he was regretful of his tweets.

In light of the tweets, Busch cut ties with King, but said it would honor its commitment to donate to the charity.

The Register’s profile was published Tuesday and included short paragraphs about the “racist tweets” from 5 years ago.

After publication, readers began investigating the article’s author Aaron Calvin, whose own social media history also evidently contained problematic social media posts, leading to blowback against the newspaper they likely did not foresee.

Twitter users quickly found tweets which could be deemed racist or homophobic by any politically correct liberal standard, and demanded the same level of transparency by the newspaper for Calvin.

Calvin subsequently began deleting tweets and locked his Twitter account.

Kostiantyn Kulyk, deputy head of the Prosecutor General’s International Legal Cooperation Department, said that he and other senior law enforcement officials tried sending their evidence to Trump’s Justice Department, but were thwarted by Deep State forces at every turn.

“We were supposed to share this information during a working trip to the United States,” Kulyk said. “However, the [U.S.] ambassador blocked us from obtaining a visa. She didn’t explicitly deny our visa, but also didn’t give it to us.”

The most bombshell evidence against the Democrats they claim to have includes:

– Sworn statements from two Ukrainian officials admitting their agency tried to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Hillary Clinton. The effort included leaking an alleged ledger showing payments to then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

– Contacts between Democratic figures in Washington and Ukrainian officials that involved passing along dirt on Donald Trump.

– Financial records showing a Ukrainian natural gas company routed more than $3 million to American accounts tied to Hunter Biden, younger son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, who managed U.S.-Ukraine relations for the Obama administration. Biden’s son served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.

– Records that Vice President Biden pressured Ukrainian officials in March 2016 to fire the prosecutor who oversaw an investigation of Burisma Holdings and who planned to interview Hunter Biden about the financial transfers.

However, Biden himself admitted, even bragged, on video of doing this during a Council on Foreign Relations conference:

– Disbursements of as much as $7 billion in Ukrainian funds that prosecutors believe may have been misappropriated or taken out of the country, including to the United States.

This report was released shortly after William Barr was appointed as Attorney General, suggesting that Obama holdovers may have been preventing this evidence from reaching his desk.

“It’s like no one at DOJ is listening,” an American lawyer who was briefed on the evidence had told Solomon. “There is some compelling evidence that should at least be looked at, evaluated, but the door seems shut at both State and Justice.”

But now that the Democrats have inadvertently revived Biden’s Ukraine dealings, perhaps Barr’s DOJ will investigate the matter further, especially now that Democrats are threatening to impeach Trump over these crimes they themselves have been accused of committing.

Every so often, however, circumstances force officials into making just such an acknowledgment.

The current debacle seeping out into the news—which is actually a long-running tale minted anew—is that oral polio vaccines are “spawning virulent strains” of polioviruses.

The alarming surge in vaccine-derived polio cases presents vaccine planners with a “quandary” or “conundrum”—because “The very tool you are using for [polio] eradication is causing the problem.”

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is in use around the world and constitutes the “workhorse” of global polio eradication efforts due to its low cost and ease of administration. The OPV contains live but weakened polioviruses that match up to wild polioviruses.

Vaccine researchers have long known that these OPV-derived viruses can themselves cause polio, particularly when they get “loose in the environment.” In settings with poor sanitation and iffy hygiene, the vaccine viruses can easily “find their way into water sources, and onto contaminated hands or foods,” where they can then launch a self-perpetuating chain of transmission.

Researchers concede that an OPV virus “can very rapidly regain its strength if it starts spreading on its own,” acquiring “mutations that make it basically indistinguishable from the wild-type virus.” In other words, there is no meaningful difference between a wild and OPV-derived poliovirus “in terms of virulence and in terms of how the virus spreads.”

BOMBSHELL: Gov Official Confirms Link Between Vaccines And Autism



A medical expert working for the government found a causal link between vaccines and autism, but federal lawmakers influenced by the powerful pharmaceutical lobby helped bury that info.

The Conundrum

Until recently, the OPV was trivalent, containing three vaccine serotypes corresponding to the three types of wild polioviruses (types 1, 2 and 3). In 2015, however, global public health agencies declared wild poliovirus type 2 eradicated and, in 2016, they decided to oversee a closely coordinated 155-country “switch” to a bivalent oral vaccine that includes only types 1 and 3. The ostensible rationale for this global maneuver was to take vaccine-derived type 2 virus out of the running; if wild type 2 viruses had disappeared, “the thinking went,” it would be “unethical to expose children to the risk the vaccine viruses posed,” particularly since type 2 had been responsible for close to 90% of the vaccine-derived polioviruses circulating since the year 2000. However, in a what-could-possibly-go-wrong scenario, the lingering background presence of the type 2 vaccine virus has prompted a spectacular backfiring of the “switch,” with vaccine-derived polio outbreaks emerging in numerous countries.

Outbreaks Unsquelched

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a combined effort of the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International. In pre-“switch” computer modeling, the GPEI’s scientific advisors predicted that some vaccine-virus-derived outbreaks would inevitably occur. However, they confidently asserted that they would be able to “quickly squelch” any such outbreaks through—what else?—the “judicious use of a new live vaccine…effective against only type 2.” In effect, they advised taking a “gamble” that the monovalent vaccine “would not spawn new outbreaks of its own.”

In Africa, at least, the gamble has failed. The frequency with which type 2 vaccine-derived outbreaks are occurring has far exceeded projections—and the rush to administer the new monovalent type 2 vaccine appears to be exacerbating rather than stemming the problem. In an astonishing admission, a CDC virologist has stated that due to the stop-gap use of the new type-2-only vaccine, “We have now created more new emergences of the virus than we have stopped.” Another vaccine expert has remarked, “if you just keep trickling in with a little bit of [monovalent] vaccine every time you think you have a problem all you’re doing is reseeding [more transmission chains].”

There had been no cases of wild poliovirus on the African continent since September 2016, but by July 2019, the WHO was cautioning that there was a high risk of ongoing type 2 vaccine virus spreading across Africa. Outbreak investigators have been documenting an uptick in circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in both human and environmental samples since mid-2017 (two years after the “switch”), generally obtaining human samples either from children presenting with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) or from “healthy community contacts.” Although the WHO describes polio as just one of AFP’s possible causes, African labs have been isolating type 2 vaccine virus in case after case of AFP.

Flu Shot Leaves Man Blind, Deaf, Unable to Breathe: CDC says Worth It



The CDC acknowledged that a Vegas man contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome immediately from his flu shot but health officials say its a rare occurrence and flu shots are still worth it.

To date, surveillance reports have noted the presence of the vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, and Somalia. In Nigeria, type 2 has spread from the north of the country to Lagos—Nigeria’s largest and most densely populated city. In Ghana, soon after investigators found type 2 vaccine viruses in sewage in the capital of Accra, a toddler 400 miles away was diagnosed with vaccine virus paralysis—representing Ghana’s “first ever” reported outbreak of type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus.

On September 19, ABC News announced a polio outbreak in the Philippines, caused—as confirmed by WHO and UNICEF—by “vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2.” The “outbreak”—which has thus far affected just two children and some sewage samples—is unfolding two decades after the WHO declared the Philippines to be polio-free. Blaming the situation on the decline in public acceptance of routine vaccination—following the rollout of a dangerous dengue vaccine that killed as many as 119 children in 2016-2017—the two global health agencies have sternly asserted that the only way to get back on track with polio is to vaccinate at least 95% of children under age 5. The Philippine government is complying, launching an aggressive polio vaccination campaign.

In other countries ranging from Myanmar to Indonesia to Papua New Guinea, surveillance programs are also reporting cases of paralytic polio resulting from circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1.

Learn How Vaccines Use Fluoride And Glyphosate To Kill You



Alex Jones breaks down how vaccines are used to trigger deadly amounts of fluoride and glyphosate already present inside your body to weaken the blood brain barrier’s blockade of these killer chemicals.

New and Improved = Same Old, Same Old

The presence of type 2 vaccine viruses “over a widening swath of territory” in Africa and elsewhere is apparently disheartening to polio eradication enthusiasts, but not to worry, they have another ace up their sleeve—another new and improved polio vaccine! In fact, two new polio vaccines are in the works. One is a “novel” genetically engineered oral vaccine supported by the Gates Foundation; the second is an inactivated vaccine hypothesized to be “powerful enough to end outbreaks.” As the WHO’s lead polio researcher has stated, “The race is on” to deploy at least one of the two vaccines under the WHO’s “emergency use protocol” by as soon as mid-2020—even before licensure. Conveniently, the new oral vaccine’s manufacturer, Bio Farma, will soon “have the capacity to make 35 million doses a month.” Meanwhile, the Gates Foundation is “pushing hard to get the [new oral] vaccine into the field as soon as possible,” speculating that it will have a lower risk of transmitting vaccine virus—however, the Foundation cautiously notes that “the only way to know for sure will be to use the vaccine.”

Eventually, the global public health community has set a goal of ending all use of the OPV and switching over to exclusive use of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) administered via injection, making the assumption that the IPV is incapable of causing vaccine-derived polioviruses to circulate. However, as Children’s Health Defense recently described, from the 1950s on, the U.S. has witnessed serious cases of paralytic polio induced by both types of polio vaccine—injected and oral. Similarly, a reporter describing the glitches with the “switch” observed that “Even children who have received IPV…can be infected by and transmit the vaccine viruses” [emphasis added].

In Pakistan, where wild polioviruses are still on record as circulating, some citizens in poor communities are refusing the oral polio vaccine, questioning a one-trick public health charade that never does anything to address more pressing health threats such as lack of running water and sanitation. Rather than respond to these reasonable concerns, the government has taken to jailing uncooperative parents, while the latter resort to “hiding their children or using fake finger markings to pretend they have been vaccinated.” Whether in Pakistan, Africa or the U.S., it is time to stop equating public health with vaccination and time to admit that vaccination programs often leave new and worse problems in their wake than those they were intended to solve.

Yesterday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the mere possibility Trump had asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry.

The inquiry was launched despite the fact that no quid pro quo was offered and Biden himself bragging that he forced Ukraine to remove a prosecutor who was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving, by threatening to withdraw $1 billion in U.S. aid.

However, last year Democrats did the very same thing they accuse Trump of doing if not worse by threatening to withdraw aid if Ukraine dropped its investigation into ultimately fallacious claims of ‘Russian collusion’.

“It got almost no attention, but in May [2018], CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe,” writes Marc Thiessen.

“In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as “strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,” the Democratic senators declared, “We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,” before demanding Lutsenko “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

As ever with Democrats, it’s one rule for them and another for the rest of us.

The suit alleges each of the defendants libeled Jones repeatedly over the summer, and failed to take any corrective action, even when the rest of the press did so.

As the suit states: “The defendants launched a campaign of lies and libels against their media competitor and ideological opponent, Alex Jones. Defendants virally spread one of the worst smears that can be spread about anyone: accusing someone of one of the most infamous federal felony crimes, even though defendant knew Jones was actually the victim of that crime.”

The suit details how cybercriminals targeted Infowars and tried to plant child porn on Infowars servers in order to be produced during discovery in other legal matters, how the FBI’s investigation cleared Infowars and identified Jones as the targeted victim of the cyberattack, and how the defendants then lied to the world about what happened by falsely accusing the victim, Alex Jones, of being the perpetrator.

Jones, as a strong advocate of both free press and free speech, resisted calls for suing those who continued to lie and libel him. But enough is enough. It is time to fight back. It is time for the truth to come out. Jones only sued those who refused requests for retractions and corrections,” said Robert Barnes, the attorney for Alex Jones.

“A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people. And a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling or blacklisting their own neighbors.” Trump urged, referencing the current trend of ‘cancel culture’.

While previous Presidents have apologized for America in front of the UN, Trump stated that he is proud to “have the immense privilege” of representing “a nation that prizes Liberty, independence, and self government for all.”

The President also hit out at open border activists, declaring that their policies are “not just,” but rather are “cruel and evil”.

You are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women, and children."" #UNGA pic.twitter.com/8Ucy96er1c — The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 24, 2019

Trump declared that globalism is dead, saying that “the future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriots, the future belongs to sovereign and independent nations.”

“Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests, but as far as America is concerned, those days are over,” he said.

US comedian Joe Rogan, a friend and supporter of Jordan Peterson, has offered his sympathy to the Canadian psychologist, professor and champion of free speech, who is said to be suffering from “horrific” withdrawal after getting off anti-anxiety medication.

Speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast over the weekend, stand-up comedian Mark Normand said of Peterson: “He’s one of these guys that you’re like ‘He’s tough as a bull, it’ll be fine,’ but then, you know, everybody’s human.”

Rogan replied that although he had never experienced opiate withdrawal, Peterson was “wise enough to understand his physical limitations.”

“It might actually be a smart thing to check yourself into a rehab with people that know how to deal with it and help you through it,” he added.

Rogan revealed he once took a painkiller, either Percocet or Vicodin, to deal with a knee surgery. He said the experience was terrible and he “hated it”, because the medication made him “really stupid.” “My brain was so numb I’d rather be in pain,” he recounted.

Jordan Peterson’s daughter, health blogger Mikhaila, said in a YouTube video last weekthat her father had checked into a rehab in New York to handle “horrific” physical withdrawal and anxiety after trying to get off the anti-anxiety drug Clonazepam.



Alex Jones breaks down the transhumanist plan to merge with AI and sacrifice humanity on the altar of progress.

Peterson’s wife of 30 years, Tammy, was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and he was prescribed the drug to be able to tolerate the stress. Mikhaila said her mother was on the brink of death a number of times but eventually went into remission, prompting Jordan to quit taking his medication. This appeared to be “hell to get off of”, in Mikhaila’s words, and Jordan was forced to seek help from professionals.

Jordan Peterson, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, rose from obscurity to international fame and infamy in 2016, following a series of videos he posted on YouTube under the title “Professor Against Political Correctness”.

In them, he criticised a bill (which has since become law) that would add gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in Canada. Specifically, the bill would enforce the use of gender-neutral pronouns such as ‘they’, ‘ze’ and ‘zie’, if required by an individual who does not identify as a man or a woman. Peterson refused to use these pronouns if requested by a non-binary student, saying it would amount to compelled speech.

Peterson’s views sparked a nationwide conversation on freedom of speech and gender expression; he has since established himself as a polarising figure, finding many admirers on the right and just as many opponents on the left.

“It’s the best time of your life,” Rogan said of his reputation. “You were an embattled professor fighting against social justice warriors [over] some sort of crazy law that was gonna enforce 198,000 gender pronouns and he was like, ‘Hey, this is crazy. Let’s stop,’ and then he becomes a national celebrity.”

He went on to praise him for making people aware of the “chaos” going on in North American universities with their foray into political correctness.

“As time has gone on, he saw all this coming, he was right… People are radicalising and a lot of it is about compliance,” he concluded."

Since July, polls have showed that at least half of American voters have opposed beginning impeachment or an impeachment inquiry. However, Democrats have decided that a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son for corruption related to his work in Ukraine was a tipping point.

Recent polls show that the testimony of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller in late July did not even persuade voters to change their opinions on impeachment. Democrats are betting that this latest issue will — but a look at previous polls is not promising for them.

The stance comes ahead of the 2020 presidential elections.

Facebook announced it would not fact-check or remove politicians’ posts that violate its community standards.

Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs and communications, made the statement in a speech in Washington on Tuesday, as the social media network prepares for the presidential election in November 2020.

“We don’t believe… that it’s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician’s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,” Clegg said.



Carpe Donktum joins The Alex Jones Show to expose the Chinese Communists buying Reddit and their plans to manipulate future elections.

While the social media giant claims it works to discredit false information intended to manipulate public opinion, it would not act as a mediator for appropriate political discourse.

“Would it be acceptable to society at large to have a private company in effect become a self-appointed referee for everything that politicians say?” Clegg asked. “I don’t believe it would be.”

Clegg’s comments come after Twitter’s June announcement that it would identify and deemphasize tweets that breached its rules but were posted by politicians and government officials.

Users could flag offending tweets and the network would cover the tweet and require users to first click on a link in order to view it.

Like other social media platforms, Facebook faces increased monitoring of transparency levels and cyber-influence ahead of the US elections.

US authorities have accused Facebook and other social networks of aiding a wide-ranging misinformation campaign largely swayed by Russian operatives aimed at helping elect President Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign.

Moscow has continuously denied the claims.

In response, Facebook has set up various partnerships with media outlets to verify dubious posts and articles, allowing journalist contributions at the bottom of inappropriate content.

In 2018, following the allegations of Russian interference, Facebook hired Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister, to clean up its scandal-plagued image.

In accordance with its new stance, Facebook will remove posts if a politician’s content poses a security risk or has the potential to incite violence.

The network said that all political advertisements must comply with Facebook rules. It also said it will not label politicians’ posts as viral and aims to make decisions based on the public interest at large.

However, politicians who post insensitive or graphic content in nature may be kept online.

“…when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements,” he said.

Social media platforms and tech giants have come under public pressure in recent years to balance freedom of expression with privacy and the regulation of inappropriate content.

From Farhad Manjoo in The New York Times, “Tucker Carlson 2024,” subheadline, “I tried to imagine a president worse than Trump. Welcome to my nightmare.”:

In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald J. Trump? […] Come, take a stroll with me through my recurrent nightmare: It’s the sweltering summer of 2029, and the man in charge is Tucker Carlson — that is, President Tucker Carlson, the one-time Fox News talker turned righteous, white nationalist economic populist, now in his triumphant second term, after having defeated the incumbent Joseph “Recession Joe” Biden back in 2024. Like Trump, President Carlson spends his first term refashioning America along racial lines. But unlike Trump, whose one term is now regarded by much of the right as a best-forgotten political disaster, Carlson advances an ethnonationalist populism that succeeds in a wild, frightening fashion. His secret: competence, a commitment to true political realignment, and a brutal online political machine that represents the full flowering of the tactics and ideology first displayed during 2014’s Gamergate movement.

Our government is supposed to exclusively serve the interests of the Epstein network. As Joe Biden told a bunch of plutocrats behind closed doors in June, nothing must “fundamentally change.”



Watch the video of Greta Thunberg attempting to stare down President Trump.

Anyone who feels differently is a Gamergater, conspiracy theorist, nativist, ethnonationalist, white supremacist AND a terrorist who needs to be hunted down by Homeland Security.

Where Trump was a chaotic, undisciplined narcissist, the Carlson who wins in 2024 is a canny political strategist who makes good on Trump’s forgotten promise to embrace anti-corporate economic policies. On paper, parts of Carlson’s agenda seem ripped from the former liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (now in exile in Toronto): His chief enemies are Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, the megacorporations owned and staffed by wealthy liberals. It’s a winning electoral formula: A large minority of Americans are willing to forgive Carlson’s authoritarian, nativist impulses if they see it as part of a war against the out-of-touch, culture-destroying corporations that are automating our jobs; killing every other industry; and exercising complete control over what we watch, read, listen to, buy and believe.

Don’t those rubes realize our corporate oligarchs are lording over us for our own good!?!?!?

Incidentally, I don’t think it’s a coincidence the Times titled this piece a generic, “Tucker Carlson 2024,” just so it would get top results on Google for who knows how long.

They’re total shills for Google and get the top results on nearly everything due to Google’s rigged algorithm changes, so it’s not surprising.

On Saturday, the New York Times ran an article lamenting how Tucker Carlson may have stopped Trump from going to war with Iran.

From The New York Times, “An Abrupt Move That Stunned Aides: Inside Trump’s Aborted Attack on Iran”:

In the days leading up to this moment, he had talked with Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, who reminded him that he had come to office to get out of endless wars, not start a new one. If he allowed himself to be pulled into a new conflict by the same people who got the United States into Iraq, then Mr. Trump could forget about his chances for re-election, Mr. Carlson told him.

The Times’ fears are not without merit.

Certainly someone must realize reengineering the entire internet to suppress populist nationalism and turning the United States into an Orwellian pre-crime hellhole where citizens have their rights taken away based off a Chinese-style social credit score implemented by the most power Big Tech companies on the planet is likely to generate some pushback.

Silencing dissidents and throwing people in prison for thought crimes is not going to fix the failures of prog-globalism.

Hopefully, Tucker Carlson makes all of our Epstein-compromised establishment‘s worst fears come true."

From NBC Washington, “Teenage Brothers Fatally Attacked Man Who Refused to Give Them Money, Maryland Authorities Say”:

Two teenage brothers fatally attacked a man at an agricultural fair in Maryland after he refused to give them money, authorities said. John Weed, 59, of Mount Airy was at the Great Frederick Fair Friday evening when the 15-year-old and 16-year-old approached him, authorities said. Several minutes after he declined to give them $1, the 15-year-old knocked him unconscious, prosecutors said.

“I think it’s despicable, and it tells me a lot about how these young people view this person by the very fact after they had him on the ground they taunted and they spit on him,” Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins said. “That to me shows hatred and disgust and despise.”

Medics flew him to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore. He died there Saturday, the sheriff’s office said. The 15-year-old boy was charged with first-degree assault, second-degree assault and reckless endangerment, the sheriff’s office said. His 16-year-old brother was charged with second-degree assault. They are charged as juveniles but the prosecutor may ask that they be tried as adults.

This is allegedly video of the attack:

If the races were reversed in this killing it would be the most popular story in the entire country with wall-to-wall media coverage and politicians demanding “action.”



Hotep Jesus joins The Alex Jones Show to fire up the silent majority into taking action to fight for the future of humanity.

Instead, most Americans will never even hear John Marvin Weed’s name.

Frederick is a city in western Maryland where Marylanders fled to to escape the “cultural enrichment” in and around Washington, DC and Baltimore.

Like most of Maryland, it used to be a very nice place to live but just so happens to be going downhill in accordance with a massive population shift.

UPDATE: John Weed’s niece Jessica set up a GoFundMe to help defer “legal cost, medical bills, and funeral costs.”

On Friday September 20th, Jay (John Weed) went to the Great Frederick County Fair to spend an evening of fun and laughter with his sister, his nieces, their loves ones and his great niece and nephew. At 5:30pm he fell victim to an unprovoked, physical assault. He was air lifted to Shock Trauma in Baltimore, where they did everything they could to save his life. The damage to his brain was too severe. He was not coming back. Late Saturday afternoon with his Mother, Father and sister by his side he passed away. Please help my family during this extremely difficult time. We never imagined such a great man would have to die like this. We are seeking justice for him but will have to fight. Anything you can do is appreciated and will be used towards legal cost, medical bills, and funeral costs.

From NBC Washington, “Teenage Brothers Fatally Attacked Man Who Refused to Give Them Money, Maryland Authorities Say”:

Two teenage brothers fatally attacked a man at an agricultural fair in Maryland after he refused to give them money, authorities said. John Weed, 59, of Mount Airy was at the Great Frederick Fair Friday evening when the 15-year-old and 16-year-old approached him, authorities said. Several minutes after he declined to give them $1, the 15-year-old knocked him unconscious, prosecutors said.

“I think it’s despicable, and it tells me a lot about how these young people view this person by the very fact after they had him on the ground they taunted and they spit on him,” Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins said. “That to me shows hatred and disgust and despise.”

Medics flew him to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore. He died there Saturday, the sheriff’s office said. The 15-year-old boy was charged with first-degree assault, second-degree assault and reckless endangerment, the sheriff’s office said. His 16-year-old brother was charged with second-degree assault. They are charged as juveniles but the prosecutor may ask that they be tried as adults.

This is allegedly video of the attack:

If the races were reversed in this killing it would be the most popular story in the entire country with wall-to-wall media coverage and politicians demanding “action.”



Hotep Jesus joins The Alex Jones Show to fire up the silent majority into taking action to fight for the future of humanity.

Instead, most Americans will never even hear John Marvin Weed’s name.

BREAKING: @FredCoSheriff has charged a 15yo + 16yo boy for the random, unprovoked attack of a 59yo man at the Great Frederick Fair. That man died today at Shock Trauma in Baltimore. Sources say the teens (currently in juvenile custody) may have been playing the “knockout game.” pic.twitter.com/58tI0FPeT5 — Kevin Lewis (@ABC7Kevin) September 22, 2019

Frederick is a city in western Maryland where Marylanders fled to to escape the “cultural enrichment” in and around Washington, DC and Baltimore.

Like most of Maryland, it used to be a very nice place to live but just so happens to be going downhill in accordance with a massive population shift.

UPDATE: John Weed’s niece Jessica set up a GoFundMe to help defer “legal cost, medical bills, and funeral costs.”

On Friday September 20th, Jay (John Weed) went to the Great Frederick County Fair to spend an evening of fun and laughter with his sister, his nieces, their loves ones and his great niece and nephew. At 5:30pm he fell victim to an unprovoked, physical assault. He was air lifted to Shock Trauma in Baltimore, where they did everything they could to save his life. The damage to his brain was too severe. He was not coming back. Late Saturday afternoon with his Mother, Father and sister by his side he passed away. Please help my family during this extremely difficult time. We never imagined such a great man would have to die like this. We are seeking justice for him but will have to fight. Anything you can do is appreciated and will be used towards legal cost, medical bills, and funeral costs.

If so, then that’s the point.

Thunberg and the modern eco-cultists all sing from the same hymn sheet, and fear is their most effective tactic.

In a speech at the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday, the 16-year-old Thunberg delivered a breathless sermon, chastising the adults in the room for stealing her “dreams” and her “childhood” by failing to take aggressive enough action against climate change.

“We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!” she thundered, voice on the edge of tears.

Since she shot to fame after organizing school walkouts in her native Sweden last year, Thunberg has been on a whirlwind tour of the world’s corridors of power. Appearing at economic forums, houses of parliament and most recently on Capitol Hill, the content of Thunberg’s speeches are always the same: what we’re doing for the planet isn’t good enough, and the end is nigh.

“I want you to act as if the house is on fire,” she told the world’s economic movers and shakers at Davos in January, asking them to “feel the fear I feel every day.”“We probably don’t even have a future anymore,” she told British lawmakers in April. And so on at every appearance, her portents of doom dutifully reported by the world’s media.



Eco fascist Greta Thunberg released a hate filled rant and looked at Donald Trump with a gaze that would turn mortal men to stone.

Thunberg’s emotional, fear-driven rhetoric has been criticized by climate scientists, politicians, and conservative pundits. While Thunberg told Congress last week to “listen to the scientists,” even the scientists of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stepped on the brakes, with one saying that the temperature rises predicted by Thunberg are simply “not going to feel like Armageddon to the vast majority of today’s striking teenagers.”

But the fearmongering is deliberate. If Thunberg is a preacher, then her bible may be a 2016 paper by climate activist and The Climate Mobilization founder Margaret Klein Salamon entitled ‘Leading the Public Into Emergency Mode: Introducing the Climate Emergency Movement.’

In a revised version, published this May, Salamon notes with pride that the paper’s language has been “adopted by several new climate groups – Extinction Rebellion, School Strikers, Sunrise Movement, and more.”

“Imagine there is a fire in your house,” the paper opens (sound familiar?). From there, Salamon argues that only fear and stress can motivate us to solve our planet’s problems. “The goal of the climate movement must be to lead the public out of ‘normal’ mode and into emergency mode,” she continues, believing that only when we’re pumped full of fear can we act decisively.

But not everyone reacts to fear with resolve and determination. Salamon acknowledges this, pointing out that helplessness, panic, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder are all common responses to an emergency. Just as some individuals will rise to the occasion, others will remain trapped in “anxiety,” “worry,” and “apathy.”

This collateral damage is already apparent. Youth activist Jamie Margolin, who addressed Congress alongside Thunberg, said that her classmates suffer from anxiety and a “weird form of nihilism,” where they question the point of making any plans for the future. Some, under the hashtag #NoFutureNoChildren, are even pledging not to reproduce until government tackle the problem.

British psychologists warned last week that children are presenting with “eco-anxiety,” while in the US, activists have held group therapy and “healing” sessions for protesters overcome with “their feelings of despair, depression, and anxiety.”

All of this begs the question: what is this fear in aid of? Those who have adopted the fear-first approach of The Climate Mobilization have already managed to grab attention and power.

In the US, The Sunrise Movement’s ‘Green New Deal’ has been eagerly adopted by 104 members of Congress, and three of the four frontrunners for the Democratic nomination next year.

As well as promising to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2050, the legislation would give government unprecedented control over healthcare, wealth redistribution, transport, food production and housing.

The Climate Mobilization’s call to action has also managed to unite leftists and anti-capitalists with the global elite. Famed for ‘shutting down’ London in April, Extinction Rebellion’s call for “net zero” atmospheric carbon is shared by The World Bank, and a host of neoliberal think-tanks and financiers.

Except while the Extinction Rebellion marchers may have taken to the streets in fear of the apocalypse, the financial titans support this movement with a view to getting their grubby hands into public coffers.

Formed by French President Emanuel Macron and investment corporation BlackRock capital last year, the Climate Finance Partnership sees government-funded carbon reduction as a “flagship blended capital investment vehicle.”

Salivating at potential profits in the world’s “developing and emerging markets,” the partnership calls for the “unlocking” of pension funds and government money to finance green industry in the developing world. Only instead of calling our planet’s situation a “climate emergency,” they call it “the climate opportunity.”

The Blended Finance Action Taskforce – comprised of 50 financial giants including HSBC, JP Morgan Chase and Citi – is even more explicit, calling for a “layer of government and philanthropic capital,” as there are “profits to be had” in “climate-related sectors…across three regions including Latin America, Asia, and Africa.”

Put simply, financial giants want your pensions and your taxes to support their investments half a world away. Greta Thunberg and The Climate Emergency Movement are paralyzing you with fear, and knowingly or unknowingly aiding the interests of the world’s mega-rich.

The same activists who call for collective guilt and punitive taxes on the western taxpayer are enabling a new breed of green capitalism, one that will make a select few fabulously rich, while the rest of us choke down meatless hamburgers and pay our politicians to tax us into oblivion.

We should be afraid of our changing climate, but we should also be afraid of zealots with good intentions.

The suspension came allegedly after a post that criticized the liberal darling and teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg – following her passionate and divisive speech at the United Nations earlier this week.

Twitter says it banned the activist for ‘platform manipulation and spam’ but Avi told Politicalite that he was banned for sending a tweet that was directed at Greta.

Yemini tweeted the following and called Thunberg an ‘extremist’.

Twitter told Yemini “You may not use Twitter’s services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behaviour that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter.”

Yemini has faced dozens of suspensions over content that Twitter deems to be ‘extreme’ and ‘hateful’ and was completely banned from Facebook earlier this year.

The activist is facing a trial in his native Australia later this year and this could possibly be part of a campaign to ‘silence him.’

Yemini told Politicalite: “If Twitter refuses to reinstate my account, it shows what lengths they’re willing to go to censor conservative voices — even when they can’t pin them for hate speech” he also urged his followers to Tweet @TwitterSupport and use the hashtag #FreeAvi to try to reverse the decision.

Over the past couple of years we have seen a tremendous boom in stock prices, and one of the big reasons for that boom is the fact that the folks on Wall Street know that Trump is always going to be looking out for their best interests. Trump understands that his chances of winning again in 2020 will be greatly enhanced if stock prices are rising and most Americans believe that we have a “booming economy”, and so he wants to do everything in his power to try to make those things happen. That means that Trump’s short-term interests are perfectly aligned with Wall Street’s short-term interests, but things will shift dramatically if someone like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders ends up in the White House. Wall Street knows that they have a friend in Donald Trump, and losing that friend would potentially be absolutely devastating.

Needless to say, a lot of investors were unnerved on Tuesday when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that a formal impeachment inquiry is being initiated. The following is an excerpt from Pelosi’s official remarks…

For the past several months, we have been investigating in our Committees and litigating in the courts, so the House can gather ‘all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity — approval of articles of impeachment.’ And this week, the President has admitted to asking the President of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The action of – the actions of the Trump Presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections. Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I am directing our six Committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.

Lord Monckton joins The Alex Jones Show to shed light on one of President Trump’s most powerful speeches to the UN. The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law.

In the aftermath of that announcement, liberal celebrities all across America erupted in celebration.

But can Nancy Pelosi unilaterally declare the commencement of a formal impeachment inquiry without any sort of a vote? According to Representative Doug Collins, she actually does not have that power…

In reaction to the Speaker’s announcement, Rep. Doug Collins(R-Ga.) tweeted, “Speaker Pelosi’s decree changes absolutely nothing. As I have been telling Chairman Nadler for weeks, merely claiming the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry doesn’t make it so. Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry.”

In any event, the Democrats are going to push ahead with their investigations, and they seem determined to dig up anything that they possibly can.

In response to Pelosi’s announcement, the White House issued a statement which accused congressional Democrats of being “in dereliction of their Constitutional duty”…

‘In a far departure from all of the work and results of this President, House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks. Their attacks on the President and his agenda are not only partisan and pathetic, they are in dereliction of their Constitutional duty,’ said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham in a statement.

We shall see how everything plays out over the next few months, but at this point it seems fairly certain that we will see an impeachment vote on the floor of the House, and it also seems fairly certain that the vote will be split largely along party lines.

Because in this day and age the truth really doesn’t matter. Even if there isn’t any evidence against Trump at all, most Democrats will vote to impeach because that is what they are expected to do. And even if Trump is 100 percent guilty most Republicans will vote against impeachment because they would be afraid of being voted out of office by angry voters back home.

So in the end it will probably come down to what the Senate decides to do, and right now the Republicans are holding 53 seats.

Unfortunately for Trump, some of those 53 seats are held by very “moderate” Republicans that are not fans of Trump at all.

Sadly, the fate of the Trump presidency is likely to end up in the hands of a small group of deeply corrupt politicians that I wouldn’t trust to properly mop the floors in my local Dairy Queen.

With that in mind, I think that Trump fans definitely have reason for some pessimism.

Democrats are licking their chops at the prospect of impeaching Trump and then getting either Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren into the White House following the next election.

Joe Biden would try to get along with Wall Street, but a Warren administration would be an absolute disaster for investors and right now she is surging in the polls.

Elizabeth Warren originally made a name for herself by attacking Wall Street. Virtually all of her economic proposals would be bad news for the top 1 percent, and the fact that she is doing so well right now is just one of the factors that are currently unsettling the markets…

For one, this time around it appears Democrats in the House have momentum toward beginning impeachment proceedings. Second, a formerly robust economic backdrop has given way to jitters about global growth and fears that the U.S. economy is nearing the end of a lengthy expansion. Less confident investors could be more jittery in the face of political headlines than was previously the case. Also, impeachment proceedings could take center stage in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, potentially damaging Trump’s re-election bid. Fears of a less business-friendly Democratic administration — amplified by the recent strength of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has moved ahead of Biden in some polls — could also be part of the mix, analysts said.

Of course the short-term health of Wall Street is not what we should really be concerned about.

At this moment, the entire global economy is plunging into a substantial downturn, and whoever wins in 2020 is going to have to face that reality.

And beyond that, we are facing long-term crisis after long-term crisis that none of our politicians really want to deal with, and in the end we are going to pay a great price for our short-term thinking.

But for the foreseeable future, the mainstream media is going to be obsessed with the political drama being played out in Washington.

And I know that most Republicans don’t want to hear this, but there is a very real chance that Donald Trump could be impeached by the House.

Then it will all come down to the Senate, and Trump’s fate will be in the hands of moderate Republicans such as Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney."

“The point now is political power,” said the Fox News host. “You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submits to your will, or else.

Last week, the New York Fed began running repurchase operations in an effort to inject liquidity into the financial system. The bank’s repo operations started last Tuesday involving about $53 billion in debt instruments and continued through the week. The New York Fed injected over $270 billion in cash into the system last week and committed to continuing daily repo operations of at least $75 billion each through Oct. 10.

Repurchase operations are an important aspect of the banking system. The repo market enables banks to borrow cash in order to maintain liquidity and meet daily needs. In a repo trade, banks and other firms use Treasurys and other “high quality” securities as collateral for short-term loans. The bank then repurchases the bonds paying a nominal rate of interest – usually within 24 hours.

Interest rates on repo deals typically hover in the same ballpark as the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate – currently set of 1.75 to 2%. But available cash virtually evaporated last Monday and that rate skyrocketed to over 10%, prompting the NY Fed to take emergency measures.

In effect, the market was pushing the interest rate up and the Fed stepped in and injected billions of dollars into the system to push interest rates back down. Peter Schiff called it a “big deal.”

“It shows that the Fed is losing control of the short end of the curve, that market forces are beginning to overwhelm the Fed’s attempts to artificially suppress interest rates.”

“Bond King,” Jeffrey Gundlach said the Fed is “baby-stepping their way to doing QE.”

“Is it an imminent disaster? No. The Fed is going to use this warning sign to go back to some balance sheet expansion.”

The Fed took another step in that direction Tuesday when it injected $30 billion in longer-term liquidity into the banking system. The NY Fed offered the additional cash through 14-day repurchase options to primary dealers. According to Reuters, the Fed will hold two more 14-day term operations on both Thursday and Friday worth at least $30 billion each.

The Fed Is At War With America



Mike Adams exposes the agenda of the private Fed as a war against the prosperity of Americans that simply want to make America great.

This is another step closer to outright quantitative easing where the Fed expands its balance sheet for the long-term. Even the mainstream concedes this will likely be required in order to stabilize the repo market. While experts pinpointed two reasons for the sudden cash shortage last week, including corporations withdrawing funds from money markets in order to make quarterly tax payments, along with banks and investors settling accounts on $78 billion of US Treasury notes sold by the US government, there is an underlying systemic problem.

According to Reuters, cash reserves that banks park with the Fed and are often made available to other banks on an overnight basis are at their lowest since 2011. This is the result of the Fed’s recent balance sheet reduction.

In other words, what we’re seeing in the repo market is a tremor caused by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening.

In the wake of the 2008 crash, the Fed bought more than $3.5 trillion in bonds and banks built up massive cash reserves at the Fed. That level peaked at around $2.8 trillion and began to drop in 2015 when the Fed started raising interest rates. The decline in reserves accelerated when the central bank began its balance sheet reduction operation. According to Reuters, “bank reserves at the Fed last stood at $1.47 trillion, the lowest level since 2011 and nearly 50% below their peak from five years ago.”

These reserves serve as the primary source of liquidity to fund the repo markets.

The repo operations over the last two weeks seem to be stabilizing the system. Overnight borrowing rates have been running at about 2%. But these short-term Fed actions don’t address the underlying problem. Ultimately, the Fed will likely have to increase its balance sheet to boost bank reserves.

In other words – more QE.

Peter said the Fed doesn’t want to deal with the problems that allowing interest rates to normalize would cause, so, they continue to work to keep them down. This is exactly what the Fed is doing with these repo operations. It essentially created money out of thin air and injected it into the financial system.

“In effect, that was like a return to quantitative easing. I mean, they’re not calling it quantitative easing, but what did the Federal Reserve do? They created money and they bought government debt and they expanded their balance sheet.”

The question is when will the Fed begin holding more bonds on its balance sheet long-term? In fact, it could already be happening.

1174,,https://www.infowars.com/nobody-knows-the-correct-fed-policy/,2019-09-24T11:57:22-05:00,Nobody Knows the “Correct” Fed Policy,"Central bankers suffer from what some might call fatal conceit. They actually believe that if they tinker enough, they can come up with a policy that will work “just right.” Maybe we should call it the Goldilocks Syndrome.

But the truth is they don’t know.

Of course, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have lots of critics — President Trump for instance. After the last Fed rate cut, he blasted Powell and company on Twitter tweeting, “Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No ‘guts,’ no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!”

Trump wants the Fed to cut deeper. Trump isn’t necessarily wrong to criticize the bank. But he appears to suffer from the same conceit as the central bankers, imagining there is a “right” policy that will make everything work.

He doesn’t know what that is either.

Peter Schiff criticizes the Fed as well. In a recent podcast, he said no matter what the central bank does, or what they call it – it’s going to stink to high heaven. The difference between Powell and critics like Trump, and Peter is that Peter doesn’t advocate for some perfect interest rate or ideal monetary policy.

Economics professor Gary M. Galles is of the same mind as Peter. As he pointed out in a recent article published at the Mises Wire, nobody knows the “correct monetary course” the Fed should follow. It’s not something that can be planned.

Jerome Powell has only been Fed chairman since last February, but he has already been initiated into the worst part of the job. Whatever the Fed does, some complain that it didn’t act sooner and/or do enough, while others complain that it acted too soon and/or did too much. The sniping also extends to every word he did or didn’t say and when he did or didn’t say it. And even the president who appointed him frequently treats him like his 2020 scapegoat-in-waiting.

When they focus on particular failings by the Fed, critics may well be correct in their objections. But they typically go farther and propose “solutions” which reflect a presumption that they know what the proper Fed policy is for whatever economic problems they see. Unfortunately, not only might their vision of the problems be faulty or incomplete, or both, but there is a huge gap between identifying monetary policy issues and knowing the right answers to them — between Fed snipers and Fed saviors. The fact is that if we rely on discretionary monetary policy, nobody knows precisely what monetary course the Fed should follow. ­The first problem facing successful discretionary stabilization or manipulation of the economy is ­the long and variable time lags between monetary policy changes and their effects on the economy (most often, but not always, 6 to 18 months). In addition, the lag before output and employment response tends to be shorter than the lag before prices respond, so that solving an employment problem can create a lagged inflation problem or solving an inflation problem could create a lagged employment problem. But even apart from that “solutions causing new problems” issue (or how much of monetary-policy-induced investment is really malinvestment, and the future problems that will impose), the different and varying lags mean that for Fed policy to effectively stabilize or stimulate the economy, it must focus on uncertain fu­ture output and inflation patterns, not present circumstances. The Fed Is At War With America

Mike Adams exposes the agenda of the private Fed as a war against the prosperity of Americans that simply want to make America great. That problem is compounded by the notorious difficulty of accurately forecasting turning points in the economy, when it is most essential to read the tea leaves correctly. When things are stable, there is little which could improve that stability, so there is little need to accurately forecast when little or nothing should be done. But responding appropriately to sharp turning points in the economy requires that the right thing be done, to the right extent, at the right time. Yet earlier this year, Simon Kennedy and Peter Coy cited not just the “widespread failure to forecast America’s Great Recession,” but a marked pattern of unreliability over time and across countries. Other indicators have similar problems. For example, downturns in the most-watched forecasting tool, the index of leading indicators, have preceded recessions by half a year to two-and-a-half years since the 1950s, but did a poor job of predicting their magnitudes, and have even predicted recessions that did not happen on multiple occasions. Absent highly reliable, commonly accepted forecasts, deciding what to do and when to do it is a far cry from a reliable science. This is even more so when every other country’s future developments and policy changes (e.g., Brexit, slowing international growth and negative interest rates in some countries) must also be factored into decisions. Active monetary policy is made even more difficult by the continually changing torrent of economic data the Fed must rely on to judge the state of the economy. That torrent includes everything from new claims for unemployment and purchasing managers’ surveys to raw materials prices and new home sales, each released at a different time, and reams of international data, as well. But every piece of data has limitations in both timeliness and accuracy (limitations that are virtually unknown to the public). Further, the data typically sends conflicting signals about the state of the economy (e.g., overall inflation and “core” inflation may be acting differently, or employment growth can be slowing while unemployment rates are falling). When no statistic is precisely right, deciding which combination of conflicting pieces of evidence provides the most accurate read this time is a task beyond our knowledge, made even harder by multiple potential interpretations of “what it all means.” Secrets Of America’s Trade War With China Leaked

Gerald Celente breaks down the economic warfare between US and China. The difficulty in conducting active monetary policy “correctly” is compounded still further by the need to accurately predict how, and how quickly, the public’s expectations will respond to any policy change. The Fed needs to anticipate how its actions and its members’ statements will alter expectations about both the present and future state of the economy and the path of future policy. It also needs to take account of what will then happen to expectations as each subsequent piece of economic news, good or bad, emerges afterward. In doing so, the Fed is hampered by the fact that today’s expectations will not change exactly as in the past, because the situation is never exactly the same and because people have adapted to some extent from what has happened in the past. But no one knows how much current reactions will differ from earlier episodes. There is always the potential for valid criticisms of active monetary policy, particularly about the necessity, timing, magnitude, and mechanisms of policy changes (including innovations, such as the introduction on interest payments on bank reserves and their effects), and how clearly the Fed’s intentions are communicated. However, in the blurry and con­stantly changing real world of conflicting economic indicators and forecasts, competing interests and policy surprises, activist policymakers do not know exactly what the “right” policy is today. Neither do their activist critics, however. Yet this should not come as a surprise. As Austrian economists have recognized for decades, central planners cannot know enough to reliably achieve efficiency or whatever else they intend, and monetary policy is a form of central planning. In fact, it is an unusually pernicious form, whose interventions undermine the accuracy of particularly important prices — interest rates — and the ability of savers and investors to productively coordinate their behavior, which teaches us not to trust our current monetary policy saviors to live up to that billing, or that every monetary policy sniper qualifies as a monetary policy savior.

They actually believe that if they tinker enough, they can come up with a policy that will work “just right.” Maybe we should call it the Goldilocks Syndrome.

But the truth is they don’t know.

Of course, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have lots of critics — President Trump for instance. After the last Fed rate cut, he blasted Powell and company on Twitter tweeting, “Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No ‘guts,’ no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!”

Trump wants the Fed to cut deeper. Trump isn’t necessarily wrong to criticize the bank. But he appears to suffer from the same conceit as the central bankers, imagining there is a “right” policy that will make everything work.

He doesn’t know what that is either.

Peter Schiff criticizes the Fed as well. In a recent podcast, he said no matter what the central bank does, or what they call it – it’s going to stink to high heaven. The difference between Powell and critics like Trump, and Peter is that Peter doesn’t advocate for some perfect interest rate or ideal monetary policy.

Economics professor Gary M. Galles is of the same mind as Peter. As he pointed out in a recent article published at the Mises Wire, nobody knows the “correct monetary course” the Fed should follow. It’s not something that can be planned.

Jerome Powell has only been Fed chairman since last February, but he has already been initiated into the worst part of the job. Whatever the Fed does, some complain that it didn’t act sooner and/or do enough, while others complain that it acted too soon and/or did too much. The sniping also extends to every word he did or didn’t say and when he did or didn’t say it. And even the president who appointed him frequently treats him like his 2020 scapegoat-in-waiting.

When they focus on particular failings by the Fed, critics may well be correct in their objections. But they typically go farther and propose “solutions” which reflect a presumption that they know what the proper Fed policy is for whatever economic problems they see. Unfortunately, not only might their vision of the problems be faulty or incomplete, or both, but there is a huge gap between identifying monetary policy issues and knowing the right answers to them — between Fed snipers and Fed saviors. The fact is that if we rely on discretionary monetary policy, nobody knows precisely what monetary course the Fed should follow. ­The first problem facing successful discretionary stabilization or manipulation of the economy is ­the long and variable time lags between monetary policy changes and their effects on the economy (most often, but not always, 6 to 18 months). In addition, the lag before output and employment response tends to be shorter than the lag before prices respond, so that solving an employment problem can create a lagged inflation problem or solving an inflation problem could create a lagged employment problem. But even apart from that “solutions causing new problems” issue (or how much of monetary-policy-induced investment is really malinvestment, and the future problems that will impose), the different and varying lags mean that for Fed policy to effectively stabilize or stimulate the economy, it must focus on uncertain fu­ture output and inflation patterns, not present circumstances.

In the summer of 2015, Juul’s product launch coincided with sampling events in major US cities. Good-looking young people distributed free Juuls at movie and music events. “The principal focus of these activities was to get a group of youthful influencers to accept gifts of Juul products,” the report states, “to try out their various flavors, and then to popularize their products among their peers.”

According to the Journal, “While cigarette smoking has dropped among teens, nearly 28% of high school students this year said they had used an e-cigarette at least once in the past 30 days, up from 21% a year earlier, according to a recent federal survey.”

A survey conducted by DIK (Trade Union for Culture, Communication and Advertising) of over 4,700 librarians around the country has produced disturbing results, despite responses from only 34 percent of recipients.

""It is the third survey in a row that points to the same thing: Development is going in the wrong direction,"" SVT reports.

“In ‘Society is withdrawing - a report on the working environment in our libraries,’ 1,618 Swedish librarians tell of a bleak development in several areas. The biggest problem according to the respondents is social unrest, which has increased from 73 percent in 2017 to 81 percent of Swedish libraries today. Social unrest refers to fighting, intoxication, and aggressiveness towards staff or visitors.”

A majority of respondents reported encountering violent incidents multiple times per year, while 18 percent said it occurs every week and 4 percent said it takes place on a daily basis.

""It can be less threatening situations like throwing a book at someone, but in the worst cases, it is physical violence against librarians or visitors – in fact, abuse,"" said Stina Hamberg, head of social policy at DIK.

""Nobody should have to face these kinds of situations in their workplace,"" she said. ""Librarians are not trained for this, they work with reading promotion and information retrieval. Not dealing with drunk people, mentally ill or socially vulnerable people.""

Nearly half (47%) of respondents said that drug dealing has taken place in their libraries in the past two years.

Librarians also say it is common to encounter men surfing porn sites or openly masturbating at computers, and one in six say they have been subjected to sexual harassment.

One in five librarians say they have considered resigning or changing professions in the past two years.

Since today's Sweden is in many ways a multicultural and secular country, it is time to review and modernise the work week to suit everyone, regardless of their religion or cultural heritage, Nils-Erik Mellström, a district chairman of the Centre Party in Filipstad, has suggested in an opinion piece in Dagens Nyheter, one of nation's leading dailies. This would include removing Christian holidays.

We are living in a time when accessibility is expected every day of the week, Mellström contended, and our way of living is out of step with the current work week.

Dan Lyman joins The Alex Jones Show to shed light on the growing immigration crisis in Europe.

The fact that most people's rest days fall on Saturdays and Sundays is “untimely” and “uneconomical,” he argued. The Christian cultural heritage, from where this tradition stems, “is almost completely played out,” Mellström argued.

Instead, he proposed to let everyone choose their rest days themselves. This, Mellström argued, would bring several benefits, including greater availability and better service. Removing extra costs for weekend work would imply “savings opportunities” for employers.

“As a municipal politician in Filipstad, I am convinced that a modernisation of the work week would have many positive effects for our municipal workers as well as for our taxpayers,” Mellström argued.

According to the website worldtravelguide.net, standard Swedish shopping hours are Monday through Friday 9:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m. and Saturday 9:00 a.m.-2:00 p.m. outside Stockholm, where many stores have longer hours.

This mirrors practices in other European countries including Germany, where many shops are closed on Sunday.

At 8.6 percent of the vote, the Centre Party lends external support to the left-of-the-centre government led by Social Democrats.

In late 2012, the liberal-agrarian and staunchly pro-EU Centre Party made headlines with its controversial proposals for a new party programme that included free immigration, polygamy and the elimination of compulsory schooling, which were later removed.

In 2011, Social Democrat Carin Jämtin suggested replacing one of the Christian holidays with a Muslim one, in order to better reflect Sweden's multicultural nature.

“Almost all of our holidays, except Midsummer and 1 May, have a religious, Christian background. Today's Sweden is a multicultural society,” Jämtin told Swedish Radio.

In 2018, the Liberal Youth, the junior wing of the secularist pro-EU Liberal Party, went so far as to suggest removing all holidays with religious or political undertones.

As a result of several decades of liberal immigration policy, over a quarter of the Swedish population today have a foreign background. Over 8 percent of the nation's 10 million-strong population are Muslims.

Speaking at an event in Rome organized by the nationalist-conservative party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), PM Orbán urged Italian leadership to protect its citizens and borders, vowing to support in the effort if they do, while acknowledging that the new government seems to be realigning itself with the globalist agenda.

""Hungary is ready to help Italy in whatever way we can, but there are areas where we cannot help,"" Orbán said. ""We cannot help with the transport and settlement of any migrants in Hungary. That is impossible.""

""But once you decide it, we can help you defend your borders, and if you are determined to send home the migrants who are already here, we can help you with that, too.""

""Mandatory settlement quotas, we cannot accept, but deportation quotas with pleasure,"" Orbán declared. ""So if PM Conte were to ask the Hungarians to send home a couple of thousand migrants from Italy back to where they came from, then Hungary will be ready and help fulfill such obligations.""

Orbán's speech came as EU officials and interior ministers from Italy, Germany, France, and Malta met in Birgu, Malta, to hammer out the details of a new 'migrant resettlement' agreement reportedly based upon on a European Solidarity Mechanism signed by 15 countries in June.

""Europe is entering a phase in which anti-migration governments could be subject to increased pressure and face attempts to cram mandatory migrant quotas down the throats of European countries,"" warned Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó during an interview on Sunday.

Szijjarto participated in a conference at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) in Washington, DC, and told a roundtable with Visegrad Group government representatives that the US had played an important role in Hungary achieving the largest economic growth in the European Union.

He said there were several common elements in the policies pursued by Washington and Budapest. They both consider the protection of their own citizens and country borders priority tasks and maintain the right to decide who can enter their country and whom they want to live with, Szijjarto added.

Gerald Celente exposes the foul cry of America as a racist nation.

In response to a question, he said Hungary respected the EU’s common values. The Hungarian government’s foreign policy is based on mutual respect, he said. Every country’s national interests must be respected in the new world order and this can also be expected from Hungary, he added.

Strengthening cooperation between East and West is in the interest of the whole of Europe, he said.

The role of central and eastern Europe in international cooperation, including Transatlantic links, was also on the agenda of the Orban-Trump meeting, he added. He said both countries considered it important to raise their voices against the persecution of Christians in conflict areas.

CEPA Vice-President Edward Lucas, who was the moderator of the discussion, said the US-Hungary summit had brought important results for the whole of central Europe.

In response to a question, Szijjarto said that despite the international sanctions against Russia, several western countries have increased their trade with Russia. In the efforts to diversify energy supplies, both EU and US partners still owe help to provide alternatives, he added.

Commenting on the Three Seas Initiative which aims to promote joint infrastructure development in the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Sea regions, he said this would only bring results if words were followed by actions.

He also said that Hungary was hopeful about cooperation with the new president of Ukraine but expects action from Kiev. The previous Ukrainian leadership took rights away from Hungarians, including curbing the right to use the mother tongue, he added.

The Hungarian government is not asking for extra rights to be granted, only for those that existed earlier to be reinstated, he said.

The United States and Hungary have agreed on an extension of visa-free entry into the country by Hungarian travelers, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said after talks with the acting secretary of homeland security in Washington.

Szijjarto told MTI that they had also agreed on the list of legislative steps to be taken by Hungary in the interest of upholding the visa-free treatment of Hungarians in the long run.

A group of 10 Syrian men were apprehended while attempting to use stolen Ukrainian passports to travel through Eleftherios Venizelos airport in Athens with hopes to reach Zurich, Switzerland, authorities say.

The men were “caught by Greek security wearing matching uniforms, sports bags and carrying two volleyballs,” Greek City Times reports.

“Police said the migrants were trying to travel on passports that did not belong to them. Airport authorities said the migrants entered the country without legal documents, and that the group hoped to get past passport control in disguise.”

Migrants are once again flooding Greece in numbers that officials believe could precipitate a disaster as bad or worse than the 2015-2016 migration crisis, as Infowars Europe has regularly reported.

In mid-September, 427 migrants landed on Greek islands near Turkey in a single day – just two weeks after over 600 swarmed ashore on the island of Lesbos in a matter of hours.

“European countries gear up for what they expect to be a repeat of the 2015 migration crisis after Greece has reported a surge in arrivals over the past several weeks and the United Kingdom claimed that more people are attempting to cross its borders over fears that a no-deal Brexit would cut their chances to get to the British Isles,” Sputnik reported recently.

“In 2019 alone, an approximate 34,000 people have arrived in Greece, the highest number since 2016. Amid the surge of arrivals and limited reception facilities, the Greek authorities struggle to accommodate all the newcomers and continue to keep them stranded on the islands in the Aegean Sea.”

Greece's foreign minister recently summoned the Turkish ambassador to ""express Greece's deep discontent"" about the growing waves of migrants coming from Turkey.

Speaking to MTI ahead of a UN meeting on African peace processes in New York, Szijjarto said there was a “desperate, politicized debate” going on within the organization on what can be considered fundamental human rights.

He said that if international law was to be interpreted literally, it was clear that those rights do not concern migration.

“One can’t wake up one day and decide that they want to live in another country and violate the borders and sovereignty of dozens of countries in order to get there,” Szijjarto argued. “On the contrary, human rights are about everyone having the right to a peaceful life in their own country.” But, he added, instead of enforcing these rights, the UN was contributing to the emergence of new migration waves.

“We’ve seen in recent days and weeks how the migration pressure on Europe has increased, how the Western Balkan region gets filled by migrants again and how terrorist organizations try to take advantage of the new emigration waves,” Szijjarto said.

This Was Trump’s Most Powerful Speech, Says Lord Monckton



Lord Monckton joins The Alex Jones Show to shed light on one of President Trump’s most powerful speeches to the UN.

The minister said Hungary was a leader when it comes to enforcing international law, arguing that it protects the fundamental rights of its citizens, along with its own and Europe’s external borders. Hungary also supports communities facing security threats, he added.

Last year, Hungary spent 7 billion forints (EUR 20.9m) on supporting African schemes aimed at improving the living standards of disadvantaged people and allowing them to remain in their homelands. In addition, the government’s aid programs geared towards the poor in the Middle East and Africa have helped some 50,000 people stay in or return to their homelands, Szijjarto said.

This is in addition to the monthly statements for my credit cards and utility bills. All this normally ends up in the trash bin to be taken to the local dump and tossed into a huge hole. Well, I no longer contribute to filling holes at the dump, but rather use my shredded paper to create compost for my garden. In this short lecture I intend to explain to you how I go about this task. It is easy and simple.

Equipment required

Large storage container such as a trash can

Paper Shredder

Compost Tumbler

Pruning Shears

To start the process, you will initially need to collect paper. This can be any sort of paper which you can find. I found it useful to visit the local weekly community newspapers and ask for their old returned copies. They will be more than glad to provide you with their excess papers.

Next, you will need to spend some time shredding the newspapers up to use in the tumbler. Do not use shredded credit cards or any other sort of plastic. Use only paper. Once it is shredded place the finished product in the large trash can.

Now it is necessary to fill the tumbler with the shredded papers. Use 2/3 paper to 1/3 garbage from the kitchen. If you have animals such as sheep, chickens or rabbits feel free to include their poop in the tumbler as well. I would like to stress at this point that I do not recommend the use of dog, cat or human poop in any way. The risk of pathogen diseases is too high.

What you can put into your compost are any sort of organic waste. These components include leaves and grass clipping, manure, non-animal food scraps, dry dog and cat food, dryer lint, old herbs and spices and even old wine. You can do as I did here and include shredded newspaper, pine needles, and wood chips. Avoid berry brambles, large twigs, and animal products such as butter, bones, and meat. Kelp meal has been known to kick start a compost pile to speed up the process. Never use coal ash as it is high in sulfur and iron and will harm your plants. Certain colored papers contain heavy metals and could damage your garden plants. It stands to reason that you should never place diseased Plants into your compost.

Now, every day you must turn the tumbler several turns. This allows the mix inside to become aerated which is important for the compost to develop properly. If left in one position continuously the material inside could be ruined. If you diligently turn the tumbler each day, then within four weeks you will start to see changes taking place. It will take a total of six weeks to as much as six months before you have compost available.

The last thing you need to do it use your new compost in your garden. If some of it has not completely turned to compost you can use it anyway and it will finish turning in the garden. Your compost when done properly should have no smell at all. If you find that the compost appears to be too dry then add more garbage to it. On the other hand, if it is too wet you can add additional paper to the mix. Keep in mind that if you add more to the compost it will take it longer to complete its cycle.

My last remark here is that should you discover that your compost is a bit on the heavy side consider adding some gypsum mix to it. Just mix it into the compost and let it sit for a few days.

As you can see from the photo the shredded paper is in the tumbler and each day Pam will take a gallon of garbage and deposit it in also. At some point we will need to stop since each time we add more garbage or paper the cycle starts all over. I am currently working on an alternative method for composting, which I will report on at the proper time."

At that point, you might have started wondering if you actually need more than sleep to not tired. Well, the thing is, there’s actually a difference between being sleepy and being tired.

Now, it might seem like we’re just playing with words trying to find what similar words mean. But, the thing is, knowing the difference between being tired and sleepy actually matters. When you can really tell the difference between these feelings, you get to know their causes and also treat some disorders that they might have caused.

Sometimes, you might even get troubled when you’re not sleep deprived or take too much caffeine but somehow you still feel tired. This is one of the reasons you need to tell the difference between being tired and just sleepy. Fine, you might take a nap or a cup of coffee to make you stop feeling sleepy, but then, that tiredness still stays.

It can be frustrating sometimes. So, how about we try and walk you through the difference, shall we?

What Does It Mean To Feel Sleepy?

A lot of people actually misinterpret the meaning of being sleepy. When you’re sleepy or drowsy, it usually means you have a strong desire to sleep.

Picture this, you’re having a burger and sitting in your favorite chair with your feet up. You’re all relaxed and cozy. At that point, your eyelids start to get heavy, and as they close, you go in a bit deeper. That right there is you being sleepy.

Basically, the longer you stay awake, the sleepier you get. A chemical known as adenosine starts to build in your brain, telling you that you need to sleep. Adenosine levels build up in your body throughout the day, that’s why you feel sleepier in the evenings and at night while reading a book or watching a show on TV.

So, how do get rid of that sleepy feeling? Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it? You sleep! And, by the time you are fully awake, you feel refreshed and don’t really feel sleepy anymore.

Now, How Does That Differ From Being Tired?

Being tired differs a lot from feeling sleepy. When you’re tired, you feel it deep in your muscles and bones, your limbs start getting heavy; you basically feel like you were in a race. You find it hard to go by the day both mentally and physically.

Feeling tired does not only come from you overworking yourself; sometimes, it is associated with other illnesses like cancer and even anemia. And, though sleep might seem like the best answer, being tired doesn’t cause you to doze off.

When you feel tired, you might sit and just rest or even close your eyes for a bit but you most often don’t sleep. Hence, sleep might not relieve the sense of being tired.

To Wrap It Up

Now that you can tell the difference between being tired and sleepy, you can easily pinpoint what you need to get out of whatever state you’re in. Now, either of these feelings could have an underlying cause. So, you need to get treatments if need be.

Do you get insufficient sleep? Do you feel extremely tired for no reason? Then you might just need to go see a physician to know what’s happening."

Last Wednesday I listed Impeachment as one of the reasons we were cashing out our portfolios as the market went back to the top and BOY are we happy we did that! Impeachment is a pretty big uncertainty to throw at the market and the expectation of that (which came to pass yesterday) along with all the other issues we saw looming for Q4 gave us good reason to get to CASH!!! and see where things land during the final earnings season for the year.

We also didn't believe China was ""fixed"" and apparently it is not though now the pressure is on Trump to pull that rabbit out of his hat in order to distract people from all the other scandals he's drowing in – just like Nixon did when he opened relations with China in February, 1972 – ahead of his own re-election campaign. The Committee to RE-Elect the President (or CREEP) didn't break into the Watergate hotel until June of 1972 and it took all the way until July 27th of 1974 for there to finally be an impeachment hearing and Nixon resigned on August 9th, 1974, leading to two glorious years of Gerald Ford, which made Chevy Chase's career.

So it's going to be chaos for the next few weeks but don't worry, we have TEN (10) Fed speaches to guide us through the rest of the week, starting with Chicago's Charlie Evans, who already said this morning that not only is trade policy uncertainty slowing U.S. business investment decisions, limits on trade and immigration could mean slower potential economic growth overall. Evans supports more rate cuts and seems to be preparing us for a weak GDP Report tomorrow morning – possibly below 2%.

This is the 3rd revision of Q2, which started off closer to 3% (and the markets went higher on that BS) but was revised down dramatiallly as Residential Fixed Investment (includes Durable Goods) declined 2.9% and state and local Government Spending was revised down to 2.3% from 3.2% while net exports dropped 0.72%. Only Consumer Spending was a bright spot and we just got a TERRIBLE Consumer Confidence Report yesterday (125.1 vs 134.2 in Aug) - so it's not likely that's going to improve – though it's still historically high.

Note that expectations have dipped below 100 as people turn much more pessimistic on the economy – even though their present situation is still very good. It's also interesting to note that Consumers see inflation running at 4.8% while the Government officially says it's 2.1% and, based on that complete and utter BS, they are only raising Social Security benefits by 1.6% in 2020 (it was 2.8% in 2019).

That 1.2% drop may not seem like much – just $24 a month out of a $2,000 benefit payment – but it's $13.2Bn Trump gets to take away from old people so he can give it to his kids, campaign donors and other rich friends.

Here's a quick quiz you can take since we have this budget chart – see if you can find Corporate Taxes? We have a PLANNED $1Tn budget shortfall but, in reality, we passed $1Tn in August already yet, under Trump's Tax Cuts, Corporations are paying just $221Bn (and they are paying less than $200Bn in reality) despite earning $2.25 TRILLION in the first quarter of 2019.

Q2 has been weaker, with just $1.9Tn beind reported so far so you can't expect them to come up with $13.1Bn (0.7%) just to keep Grandma from having to eat cat food, can you? Once upon a time in America (until the 60s), Corporations used to pay 2/3 (66%) of all tax revenues, now it's 6.3% – ONE TENTH (1/10) of what they used to pay – and they still complain about that! Since they are never going to be happy anyway – why not let Elizabeth Warren loose and give them something real to complain about?

Instead, the Corporations have taken over our Government and they have taken over the courts, which is why they are now considered to be Citizens (see Citizens United), which has given them control of the Senate and they are working on the House and they clearly control the GOP and, if you do want to stop them – this coming election is probably your last chance because we're either going to reverse this tide or it's going to drown us!

Trump isn't the whole problem – he's just a symptom of what's really wrong with this country – Oiligarchy…

It really let me see how you look at the numbers and use the 5% rule to see where inflection points occur and what the bands look like. This was incredibly helpful. I actually sold out of my small short position at a good profit ( which was more a bet on a short term fluctuation rather than a hedge after listening to you) and will look more deeply at my portfolio and how to hedge it. In addition your view on hedging was also very helpful looking at the leverage you can get w/ a small spread, and protect portfolio against a big move against me. Thank you for your sharing this. Very helpful. Batman

Phil- great call in oil this morning! Now that Im no longer studying and am back in the real world I can only check this in the morning, at lunch, and after work. Anyways, you've been killing it on oil ( even more than you usually do) so I made a point to wake up extra early and made .25 off your ‘buy oil if you're brave'recommendation. It's nice to wake up and scalp 100+ bucks before I even start my real job. You lay those golden eggs everyday Phil! I thank you for that! Jromeha

Phil - It is nice being more discipline with my trading. Generally, I am out earlier than most, but my results, overall, are much better than they were when I was trying to squeeze 80 cups of lemonade out of one lemon! On the other side, I am learning the value of rolling and turning losses into non-losses or small gains. I so appreciate the time you have spent with me and others who have benefited greatly from your knowledge. Thank you! Dclark41

Phil – BTW, the new STP/LTP coupled with the income portfolio is Perfect! I do not trade all of them, very few actually since I work during market hours. However, following the trades real-time is very educational. I did enter the ABX call if you recall, I rolled to July on that nonsense news that sent it tumbling. Out today for 110% gain (2.00 stop) not counting covering the loss from the earlier roll. Nonetheless, a good trade. Keep it up…. Thanks JFawcett

Phil I have been telling you for a while how I feel like I am really understanding you now and thanking you. Well today may have been my most successful futures trading day since I began here and the week has been spectacular! It has just seemed so easy when you give us a range and I execute properly. Thanks once again for teaching me to fish. My portfolio gained over 10% this week which is just amazing. Craiga620

Boring trading – Phil/ Thanks to PSW, my yearly covered-writes are on pace for 15%. Add the long puts and well over 20%… and I look at it once a day and never lose sleep over it. Actually doing better than my trading account at this point (Thanks, summer 2013) Anyway, the point is that anyone with enough money would be wise to do the 20% – 40% stuff and do trading as a hobby… Arivera

As a fellow ""low-end"" investor I like Phil's Buy/Write strategy on solid stocks. Before I came here I loved to try to ""figure things out"" with very little success ""TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT""! I traded too much and fell in love with stocks that ""should have done"" what they didn't do. Now a majority of my accounts are in Buy/Writes suggested here or cash (waiting for a better time for more Buy/Writes). I use 15-20% of my total holding to short term trade and hedge. This is manageable with my full time job as a business owner. I have found Phil's system a more discipline way to achieve the returns I want without relying on my ability (more like inability to ""figure things out""). DCalrk41

Being a bear is easy (and I am not convinced we are doing all that well on the whole as an economy), but one cannot fight the trend (didn't Phil say that a while ago)? Just cover, make 5-10-15-20% and move on. It really does add up by chipping away. All I can say is I am back to 2007 levels in my account b'f the crash with this run up and some very nice help on this board….so kudos to us (and me!!)… Pharmboy

Against all prognostics (bears) Phil pointed in the morning the correct direction, and in middle of day he pointed the possible move to 2.5% Incredible… I'm starting to serious believe on the program trading and the human nature behind the programing those ""trade-bots"". Spider

USO, QQQ- Phil, thanks for these plays. Out of USO for about 65% gain today and just keeping 1/4 QQQ. Ksone88

I have followed a lot of Phil's picks over the last several years and made money using the exact option strategies he outlines. Of all the contributors on SA, he offers the most actual and ready to implement advice that has put money in my account. Many of us on SA actually are sad when we don't see Phil's postings for an extended period. Brenteaz

Phil - I know I am small change compared to most others members, but I just wanted to let you know that during the last two weeks with the shorts you and others suggested I have 6 winners and 5 losers. My losers were small because I tried to follow your guidelines as best I could. On the other hand my winners on average were around 50%. Consequently, I am up $2000 in 14 days. Thank you for your patience and help. I think I am making progress getting rid of some of my poor trading habits of the past! DCalrk41

Phil - Your logic not only makes sense, but it made a lot of premium profit for me over the past 12 months. I have recovered much of the massive equity losses of last year. My Monday play is the sale of long term puts on FXI. Love the premium! Gel1

That was a quick double on the DIA calls. trailing stop in place. Kwan

Phil – I think I finally figured out your ""crystal ball"" time frame. You're about 5-14 days AHEAD of what the market is going to do. It's taken me a long time to realize this, but boy it's been profitable. I go in when you recommend something at about 25% allocation, and then add to it each day it ""goes the wrong way"" Then BOOM, one day it's all good…. The long put list was literally exact in it's timing. Burrben

This is my first month here. Today was a money train with futures. I gained 7500 USD with KC, RB, CL, NG. I took RB almost every direction up and down. And I only used 1 contract or maximum 2. Thank you. I think it was a good investment to subscribe… Kgabor

Phil is a fundamentalist to his fingertips. His ability to value a stock goes well beyond p/e, as he understands the essence of many businesses, what gives them value and how they make their money. As such, his recommendations are invaluable to a investor who takes a value-oriented approach. Zeroxzero

Took profit on QQQ 57 Puts, bot 40 at $0.07, sold 20 for $0.15 and 20 for $0.32. Thank, Phil Bobhu

Thanks, I managed to make 2k today so I am happy…and feel like I am finally getting it. New equipment and a quiet place to work helps a lot. I am happy for all the members that took your /NKD advice….that was fun I am sure! coke Take your vitamins…I don't know how you do all this! but, keep it up! Coke

Market manipulation…. One of the things I've gained from this site is the concept of market manipulation. I never thought it was so prevalent, but now I know it is. I actually consider its effect when I make trades. Several days ago, when AAPL was moving toward 220 I sold 210 calls. My reasoning was that they will probably pin this month at 210. They came in big time as the stock moved ever closer to 210. I agree with Phil's comment that one of the things we need to do is find out what they are manipulating, and how, and hitch a ride. They are doing this with several equities. I've actually seen one article describing several equities that were being manipulated to pin at expiration each month, and describing how it was done, and of course Phil has described it well. In some ways it's easier to figure this out than it is a ‘normal' market behavior, and thus easier to make money in certain equities. Iflantheman

Peter D, Just a note of thanks. Eight weeks ago, I entered my first RUT strangles, when the RUT was at 625. Tomorrow, I will let them expire, with the RUT at 625 (give or take). I didn't care when the RUT went to 650, nor when it dropped to 590. Easiest, no touch money I've made in a long time. Judahbenhur

Every time I read Mr. Davis' market analyses and reports about his super profitable trades I feel admiration mixed with envy for the overall brilliance of this man, intellectual and verbal, his extraordinary savvy in the exotic art of options and, last not least, his moral passion with which he writes, even if in passing, about the darker aspects of capitalism. RussianBear

Thanks, after years of blood and blunders, I have reached a significant milestone – I don't lose money. Net net, I rarely have a losing week, market up, market down. And that I owe to you. Balanced positions. More premium sold than bought. Fundamental criteria applied to good companies, not momentum/ news headlines/ stock du jour/ triangle squeezies. But rather earnings, P/E, dividends, competitive position — the boring stuff that takes study, thought,….and patience. You have been a great teacher, and I have embarassed myself repeatedly day with how slowly I learn. And it's a funny thing – if you don't lose, the gains start to pile up. The arithmetic is cruel to the downside, and becomes a gift in the other direction. And I'm in this for the long run, having made myself unemployable through a need for diversification. Moreover, what I've learned here has also elided into other areas, including real estate and ex-U.S. investment. Pretty cool. Have a great weekend. Zeroxzero

Phil has some great insight into the market. He's given me a different perspective on the market and I know I'm a better trader/investor because of it. I've been trading options since the late 80's and Phil is right. Unless you know what is going to happen (how can you, unless you have insider information), then do what the smart money does - be the house. Remember guys, we're allowed to sell options. If you're afraid to be short, then do a spread to limit your liability. When I think about the money I've made and lost on options, a good approximation is that I win 30% of the time when I do a straight buy; I win about 70% of the time when I do a spread; I win nearly 90% of the time when I sell naked. Autolander

Phil, 26% on the week for the 20% I day-trade, and since drinking the kool-aid last fall, the whole portfolio has doubled. Have a great weekend !! JRW III

Phil I must say that it was really nice to have a portfolio that was looking very stable in the face of a rough day for the markets. I ended the day up 0.3% which includes another successful day of futures trading. So with a portfolio of mostly cash, a few of our faves like Apple and LL, JO, TOL, DIS, etc., along with a couple of hedges that paid off nicely today, and my futures trades, I never had to break a sweat during that madhouse today. Yes, by George (or Phil), I may be learning this system! Craig

Well that was a fun day. Cashed out my GS 140 calls for about 35% profit and my AAPL calls for 38% gain. Not bad for 40 minutes of work. Back to 85% cash. Singapore Steve"
1219,,https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2019/09/23/the-next-recession/,2019-09-23T00:00:00,The Next Recession,"The drumbeat of recession calls grows louder every day. One of the biggest drivers of this is simply due to how long it’s been since the economy experienced a setback. We are in the 41st quarter of the current economic expansion.

What’s notable about this period, aside from the duration, is also how modest growth has been. On average, previous expansions saw 1.06% quarterly real GDP growth. This current one is running at 0.57%.

I’ve heard people make the case that the next recession could be mild due to the tepid nature of this current expansion. They liken it to jumping out of a first floor window. We haven’t climbed that high, so how bad could the fall really be? This might be true with respect to the economy, but what about the stock market?

Unlike the economy, the stock market has grown at a blistering pace. The chart below shows the change in stocks during every economic expansion going back to 1950.

It’s hard to imagine a scenario where the economy gets killed and the stock market hangs in there. On the other hand, it’s totally conceivable that the next recession is mild, and that the stock market bears the brunt of it (pun intended)."

Phil.... I remember back in March of '09, you stated "" Unless you think the country is going to hell in a hand-basket, NOW is the time to do your buying"". Do you remember ? I took your advice, and bought leap $2.00 calls on F, approximately 200,000 shares using the options, for just pennies. Now that was the best Ford I ever owned.... made over $1 mil - thanks go to you Phil. I now drive a Mercedes but still ""love"" the Ford. 1234Gel

As a retired stockbroker from a major Canadian brokerage firm, I can tell you I would never had access to these type of trade ideas, especially the hedges. Just closed out a July TZA 40/45 call spread today for a 271% gain in less than a month. I would have normally let that run but yesterday Phil commented to another member something to the effect that ""you put down a $1 for a $5 upside, now that you are up 250% you have $2.5 in and you are hoping for a double."" Just closed out a USO July $38 put that Phil suggested yesterday for a 49% one day gain. Thanks, Bob RJK

PSW – Price/Value; The value of PSW on a regular basis exceeds by far the price of the annual subscription. The edition of February 26 'Which Way Wednesday – Popping or Topping?', – priceless for the serious investor. Winston

Phil, I wanted to thank you for all of your teaching, advice, and guidance. Because of you I don't chase, don't worry about missed chances, and play things much more selectively. Yesterday's /ES and /TF and today /CL are my first futures plays of the month. Thanks Phil. (Out of /TF and /ES yesterday with a nice gain) Japarikh

Happy Thanksgiving Phil and to your family and associates. Also to all of the other fellow citizens of Phil's Stock World. I am particularly happy and thankful that I clicked on your article in Seeking Alpha a number of years ago. That opened the gate to Phil's Stock World and ""being the house"". My wallet thanks you as does my peace of mind in trading options, stocks and rarely futures. Your liberal views opened up my views—being a boot strapper (pulled myself out of a poor background) I was a CONSERVATIVE—cynical of others who weren't as driven. Now, I am much less so; you have taught me more than how to make money and manage risk. So, again I give thanks to you and the others of PSW!! Newthugger

Phil: I am always able to figure out your trades, including the rational when put in the right context of previous comments, etc. Keep doing what you're doing. It is much appreciated, and invaluable. Your hit rate of successful trades has been very high in my 1.5 months as a member, but even more importantly is your teaching of how to repair and DD positions that haven't gone your way yet. As with most members, we all have our ‘pet' trading interests, and learning how to think about trading is much more important than a specific trade, which could see the conditions behind it change an hour later. This is the classic case, of ‘Teach us to Fish', rather than just giving us a fish once in a while. Thank you! Neverworkagain

Thanks, Phil. I really appreciate your sentiment and commitment! Just want to thank you for what you do for all of us. JBaker

Phil: Once again thanks for those inciteful comments, and the old links to Sage's portfolio management (I hadn't read before). I'm an experienced stock trader, but over the last 3 or 4 months have come to appreciate options trading here at PSW, and the consistency of your many premium-selling strategies. It is liberating to have to worry less about getting direction right and being able to generate 5% MONTHLY returns with close to delta-neutral positioning. Much appreciated! Neverworkagain

Gel1…..I've been here 6 months, mostly watching and learning. Lots of smart people on the site and I've learned a lot from Phil and many others. //// Inflan - I have to trump your sentiments regarding the wisdom of the board. I have to thank Phil and the many contruibutors for a 80% profit for 2009. I have learned a lot and am still learning ( even occasionally about political issues - ha! ) Iflantheman & Gel1

I have been a ""silent"" member for the past year, and am 1,000 hours into the 10K hours of training (The last week is worth at least 500 hours!). Made lots of mistakes and misunderstood quite a few of Phil's calls, … some actually made money when reversed. The chat (Including the politics) is very engaging (Many great minds with international coverage), and a great companion, while nursing a trade gone wrong, through the night. The webinars (despite technical difficulties) are extremely useful. Thanks for your coaching … it has made me a consistently profitable trader, with a better understanding of what I do not know.

Took profit on QQQ 57 Puts, bot 40 at $0.07, sold 20 for $0.15 and 20 for $0.32. Thank, Phil Bobhu

Phil, those OIH $80 p that you recommended last week for ~$1 are now worth $5.50! Greg

Tesla et. al. – I've spent many months getting hammered shorting overvalued Momos, until, finally, I internalized Phil's message. Play small; give yourself plenty of room to double/move up the [lack of value] chain in terms of price. Play short; take [Musk's, eg.] latest bleep and sell the spike for a short time frame, because his tweets always come to naught. I've been coining money doing it, I just watch that premium melt away with scarcely veiled amusement. Swinging for the fences is for suckers [me, for a long time]. Those little gains really add up — $2k per week of evaporated premium and you could actually buy a Tesla by the end of the year!! zeroxzero

Phil: Closed out ZION with 49 % gain! RMM

Opt, I think the hardest thing is being disciplined enough to trade with you. Atleast now when I see something go in the red I know how much I'm going to loose and that I will profit somewhere else and have enough money left at the end of the day to trade again. Thanks for all your hard work! My stress levels are down 75% and I have even made a small profit in the short time I've been here Mopar

Thanks to your teaching and guidance, I was able to make a killing on my /TF shorts. I averaged into 12 shorts at 1252 and got out of 6 at 1242 and 6 more at 1235. Last week I did the same with /CL, though I got out too early and left $2 on the table. Thank you! Japarikh

I really would like to meet all of the posters here who seem like an intriguing bunch of intelligent, opinionated (without being obnoxious or condescending most of the time), and well spoken people. Not so easy to find in this age of instant gratification and me first attitudes. Usually this results in groups where misinformation is used to gain an advantage, or whatever it takes to beat the other guys. I love the one for all, all for one vibe here, sharing your best ideas and helping each other work together for a common goal, to be successful investors! craigsa620

Phil, I followed your investing ideas in LTP quite closely. It seems your insightful fundamental analysis knowledge serves you v. well. I get entertained and they are profitable. Investwizard

I want to thank you for the FREE LL trade. I This was the first spread trade for me and promised to join your service if I made money. I closed the spread last week and will be joining next week when we return home. Captain Mogul

Dear Phil, I have followed along with your commentary and alerts and have been flabbergasted at your quick analytical skills and your journalistic skills to explain it clearly. In a little over three weeks I have cleared almost 1000.00 dollars and got an intensive education at the same time. I would like to immediately upgrade my membership. It is hard for me to follow all evening as I am in Tokyo but I can join you at the beginning of the market and read the next day. Tokyolife

I'd like to wish Phil and everyone else that contributes to this board a very Merry Christmas and happy New Year. The wealth of knowledge on here is incredible, and it has greatly contributed to my understanding of markets, politics, and the world in general. This year was when Phil's teachings all seemed to click in place, and my portfolio's performance shot up, and for that I am very grateful. Thank you! Palotay

Well that was a fun day. Cashed out my GS 140 calls for about 35% profit and my AAPL calls for 38% gain. Not bad for 40 minutes of work. Back to 85% cash. Singapore Steve

Great call on expe Phil! Went long 50 shares and sold for a nice profit! And Great call on the nkd shorts as well. I didn't use a stop that tight and was able to cover for a $400 gain. Works been keeping me pretty busy and I'm jealous of all the members who are able to check in here more often! It's almost always quite profitable! Looking forward to Vegas! Jromeha

Thanks to Phil (again) for the lessons on the art of the roll, selling premium and hanging tight under fire (particularly in the first hour of trading-MADNESS). Watching you manage the $25KP has really helped my trading in a big way. Oknoman"

Last Wednesday I listed Impeachment as one of the reasons we were cashing out our portfolios as the market went back to the top and BOY are we happy we did that! Impeachment is a pretty big uncertainty to throw at the market and the expectation of that (which came to pass yesterday) along with all the other issues we saw looming for Q4 gave us good reason to get to CASH!!! and see where things land during the final earnings season for the year.

We also didn't believe China was ""fixed"" and apparently it is not though now the pressure is on Trump to pull that rabbit out of his hat in order to distract people from all the other scandals he's drowing in – just like Nixon did when he opened relations with China in February, 1972 – ahead of his own re-election campaign. The Committee to RE-Elect the President (or CREEP) didn't break into the Watergate hotel until June of 1972 and it took all the way until July 27th of 1974 for there to finally be an impeachment hearing and Nixon resigned on August 9th, 1974, leading to two glorious years of Gerald Ford, which made Chevy Chase's career.

So it's going to be chaos for the next few weeks but don't worry, we have TEN (10) Fed speaches to guide us through the rest of the week, starting with Chicago's Charlie Evans, who already said this morning that not only is trade policy uncertainty slowing U.S. business investment decisions, limits on trade and immigration could mean slower potential economic growth overall. Evans supports more rate cuts and seems to be preparing us for a weak GDP Report tomorrow morning – possibly below 2%.

This is the 3rd revision of Q2, which started off closer to 3% (and the markets went higher on that BS) but was revised down dramatiallly as Residential Fixed Investment (includes Durable Goods) declined 2.9% and state and local Government Spending was revised down to 2.3% from 3.2% while net exports dropped 0.72%. Only Consumer Spending was a bright spot and we just got a TERRIBLE Consumer Confidence Report yesterday (125.1 vs 134.2 in Aug) - so it's not likely that's going to improve – though it's still historically high.

Note that expectations have dipped below 100 as people turn much more pessimistic on the economy – even though their present situation is still very good. It's also interesting to note that Consumers see inflation running at 4.8% while the Government officially says it's 2.1% and, based on that complete and utter BS, they are only raising Social Security benefits by 1.6% in 2020 (it was 2.8% in 2019).

That 1.2% drop may not seem like much – just $24 a month out of a $2,000 benefit payment – but it's $13.2Bn Trump gets to take away from old people so he can give it to his kids, campaign donors and other rich friends.

Here's a quick quiz you can take since we have this budget chart – see if you can find Corporate Taxes? We have a PLANNED $1Tn budget shortfall but, in reality, we passed $1Tn in August already yet, under Trump's Tax Cuts, Corporations are paying just $221Bn (and they are paying less than $200Bn in reality) despite earning $2.25 TRILLION in the first quarter of 2019.

Q2 has been weaker, with just $1.9Tn beind reported so far so you can't expect them to come up with $13.1Bn (0.7%) just to keep Grandma from having to eat cat food, can you? Once upon a time in America (until the 60s), Corporations used to pay 2/3 (66%) of all tax revenues, now it's 6.3% – ONE TENTH (1/10) of what they used to pay – and they still complain about that! Since they are never going to be happy anyway – why not let Elizabeth Warren loose and give them something real to complain about?

Instead, the Corporations have taken over our Government and they have taken over the courts, which is why they are now considered to be Citizens (see Citizens United), which has given them control of the Senate and they are working on the House and they clearly control the GOP and, if you do want to stop them – this coming election is probably your last chance because we're either going to reverse this tide or it's going to drown us!

Trump isn't the whole problem – he's just a symptom of what's really wrong with this country – Oiligarchy…

That is our response to market uncertainty and we are officially cashing out our Money Talk Portfolio after a very successful 2-year run where we've taken it from a $50,000 start to $124,043, which is up a whopping 148%. I'll be on BNN's Money Talk Show later this evening to discuss the matter but, in short – it's simply too hard to protect those gains against all the market uncertainty regarding the Fed, Trade, Brexit, the Middle East, Election Interference, Impeachment, Overpriced Stocks & Indexes and, of course, a slowing Global Economy. While the market is, so far, content to ""soar and ignore"" – I don't think we have more than 10% left in the best of circumstances while the risk is a 20% drop – so I'd rather sit this quarter out.

Of course ""sitting out"" doesn't mean we won't still find things to trade – I just want to get a clean start in 2020 and I don't want to risk what we've made in the last quarter of 2019. We also reviewed our Hemp Boca Portfolio yesterday morning in our Live Member Chat Room and, though it's only 4 months old and only up 8.2% so far, we reduced our risk on that one as well. One difference is I'm on the Hemp Boca show at least once a month to make adjustments but only on Money Talk once a quarter and, between now and January – I really can't condone the risk of holding positions without the ability to make changes!

Our Butterfly Portfolio is market neutral and self-hedging so we simply removed some of the riskier plays but the Options Opportunity Portfolio, which is now up almost 300% in less than two years is going to be completely closed down, as will the Long-Term Portfolio and the Short-Term Portfolio that protects it. As with our Hemp Boca Portfolio, I will be highlighting those trades I think are worthy of keeping but, for the purposes of our educational porfolios – I think there's more to be gained next year starting with a clean slate so we can emphasize portfolio building strategies and stock picking.

Here's our Hemp Boca Review from yesterday's Live Member Chat Room:

OK, so let's see if I can actually bring myself to shut down the portfolios. We'll start with the Hemp Boca Portfolio as it's small and I should go on the show this afternoon (haven't decided yet).

Hemp Boca Portfolio Review: This portfolio is not as constrained as Money Talk as there's a show every Tuesday and I can go on when I want (PSW Investments owns 20% of Hemp Boca). We started back on May 21st so it's 4 months old and we're up 8.2% but we were down about 20% at one point (same positions) so I'm not sure I want to risk Q4 in such a small and new portfolio.

The question is, as it will be with EVERY position in EVERY portfolio this month – do we, right now, want to be in this position if the market drops 20%?

IMAX – Worst case is owning IMAX for $20 and I'm generally fine with that but you have to keep in mind it's a $50,000 portfolio with $100,000 in ordinary buying power (we're assuming not IB as those guys are crazy!). It's a conservative position that's in the money and we should have good support at $21 and $20.50 held on the last dip so hard to kill – especially as I expect Q4 to be huge box office for IMAX. Max possible on the spread is $4,000 and now net $2,325 so $1,675 (72%) left to gain by Jan seems like one we should keep. Damn it! This is hard…

M – We are ahead so we're going to kill it . Not actually ahead, down $900 on the overall position but too risky for the small portfolio in an uncertain market.

MJ – Back to the lows on this one but I want to stick with them.

TAP – Had a nice pop and we're on track at net $7,500 out of a potential $20,000 but, if we spend $3,200 to buy back the short puts , we reduce our risk and still have a $20,000 spread – it only increases our net cost from $4,750 to $7,750 but, since that will make us net $10,700 (no more short puts to subtract), then we're in the spread for a very good price without so much downside risk and we still have $9,300 (87%) upside potential .

THC – We just added these and they blasted higher and we have a 20% cushion to STILL be in the money – what's not to love? The net is now $3,762 out of a potential $7,000 so $3,238 (86%) left to gain – another keeper.

Well, that went terribly. It's very hard to shut down good positions. At least I feel less risky without those high Macy's puts and the big TAP obligation. If all goes well, we have $14,213 of upside potential that we're confident in plus whatever MJ makes and we're up $4,110 already and $18,313 would be 36.6% over 2 years in a $50,000 portfolio we started 4 months ago – that's not a bad start!

Best of all, we are still mainly in CASH!!! so we can DD on any or all of our positions if the market does turn lower.

Note that in the Money Talk Portfolio Review, we also pointed out some ""keepers"" – especially IBM, which is our 2019 Trade of the Year and that trade idea, as it stands now, is only net $2,707 on 5 contracts and, although that's already up $2,532 (1,446%) from our $175 entry on 2/1, it is a $7,500 spread and still stands to gain another $4,793 (177%) – so it's still good for a new trade and IBM only has to hold $135 into Jan of 2021 to make that money and, as our Trade of the Year – we certainly have the confidence it can ride out a little dip along the way. Still my favorite trade at the moment!

One thing I'd like to emphasize here is how well a portfolio can grow if you are CONSISTENT in your profit-making strategies. Warren Buffett says he only has one rule of investing and that is: ""Don't Lose Money"" because losing money costs you something more valuable than money – it costs you TIME! If your portfolio stragegy makes you 20% in a good year and loses 10% in a bad one, then your growth can be 100, 120, 144, 129, 155, 140… While a strategy that makes ""just"" 10% EVERY year yields 100, 110, 121, 133, 146, 161 – even if you win 3 out of 5 times (60%) in the 20/10 strategy, you still get your ass kicked by a consistent 10% gainer.

That's why, although the Hemp Boca Portfolio may seem dull with an 8% gain in 4 months, it's on track to go from $50,000 to $80,000 in 24 months if we consistently make 2% a month but, in reality, as our portfolios begin to gain traction, we are able to take a few more risks to accelerate that growth even further but really, even the MTP's 148% is ""only"" a consistent 4% monthly gain and that is not hard using our ""Be the House – NOT the Gambler"" system – we just demonstrated that with last month's PSW Report on ""5 Trade Ideas to Make $25,000 in 5 Months"" where we are using just $6,565 in cash and $26,659 in margin to make $33,603 (511%) by Jan 17th, 2020 – if all goes well and, so far, it is.

CONSISTENCY is why we are happy to give up some of our gains in order to hedge our portfolio and, at this point in their cycel, the gains in our portfolios and the size of the positions have led us to conclude that CASH!!! is the best hedge at the moment. Other than changes in the Dollar – we can't lose with CASH!!! and we ALWAYS are able to find things to buy – just take a look at 5 years of our Top Trade Alerts – we average between 70% and 80% success rates on those!

At S&P 3,000, a lot of good news is already anticipated by the market and PERHAPS an actual trade deal with China coupled with an easy Fed can take us another 10% higher but then I'd be selling anyway and the trick of the markets – especially the options market – is that you get much better prices selling during a rally than you do in a downturn, especially if you are forced to sell in a hurry. So it makes sense for us to take this opportunity, as we revisit the market highs for the 5th time in two years (2,872 in Jan 2018) to take the opportunity to cash out and start some new portfolios from scratch for 2020.

We'll see what the Fed does this afternoon and, more importantly, what Powell has to say at 2:30 but, if you remember last time (July 31st), the Fed gave us a 0.25% rate cut and Powell could not have been more doveish in his statements but then the President threw a temper tantrum and the S&P fell from 3,020 (higher than it is now) to 2,850 (down 5%). We're just cashing out ahead of the madness – up or down, it's going to be a hell of a ride!

REUTERS/Ann Saphir/File Photo

DETROIT (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Wednesday said that not only is trade policy uncertainty slowing U.S. business investment decisions, limits on trade and immigration could mean slower potential economic growth overall.

Evans, who supported the Fed’s July rate cut and has signaled he would support more easing to boost excessively low inflation, did not talk directly about interest-rate policy in his remarks, prepared for delivery to a conference on North American trade and the auto industry.

But his remarks suggest that trade policy uncertainty, as U.S. President Donald Trump uses tariffs to try to squeeze a better trade deal from China and other trading partners, could provide an additional rationale for a further interest rate cut. Fed policymakers next meet in Washington in two weeks.

“When businesses are weighing whether or not to make substantial investments, uncertainty tends to slow down such decisions,” Evans said. “The auto industry has been especially challenged by the uncertainty posed by actual and proposed changes in trade policy, as its production operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are closely linked across the three countries.”

Evans’ comments also linked two policies central to the Trump administration — reducing trade and immigration — to a lower long-term growth path for the United States.

Trump has said his policies will deliver 3% growth. In contrast, Evans on Wednesday suggested that limiting trade, which reduces competition and productivity, and restricting immigration, which limits workforce growth, could slow potential growth to just 1.5%."

Last Wednesday I listed Impeachment as one of the reasons we were cashing out our portfolios as the market went back to the top and BOY are we happy we did that! Impeachment is a pretty big uncertainty to throw at the market and the expectation of that (which came to pass yesterday) along with all the other issues we saw looming for Q4 gave us good reason to get to CASH!!! and see where things land during the final earnings season for the year.

We also didn't believe China was ""fixed"" and apparently it is not though now the pressure is on Trump to pull that rabbit out of his hat in order to distract people from all the other scandals he's drowing in – just like Nixon did when he opened relations with China in February, 1972 – ahead of his own re-election campaign. The Committee to RE-Elect the President (or CREEP) didn't break into the Watergate hotel until June of 1972 and it took all the way until July 27th of 1974 for there to finally be an impeachment hearing and Nixon resigned on August 9th, 1974, leading to two glorious years of Gerald Ford, which made Chevy Chase's career.

So it's going to be chaos for the next few weeks but don't worry, we have TEN (10) Fed speaches to guide us through the rest of the week, starting with Chicago's Charlie Evans, who already said this morning that not only is trade policy uncertainty slowing U.S. business investment decisions, limits on trade and immigration could mean slower potential economic growth overall. Evans supports more rate cuts and seems to be preparing us for a weak GDP Report tomorrow morning – possibly below 2%.

This is the 3rd revision of Q2, which started off closer to 3% (and the markets went higher on that BS) but was revised down dramatiallly as Residential Fixed Investment (includes Durable Goods) declined 2.9% and state and local Government Spending was revised down to 2.3% from 3.2% while net exports dropped 0.72%. Only Consumer Spending was a bright spot and we just got a TERRIBLE Consumer Confidence Report yesterday (125.1 vs 134.2 in Aug) - so it's not likely that's going to improve – though it's still historically high.

Note that expectations have dipped below 100 as people turn much more pessimistic on the economy – even though their present situation is still very good. It's also interesting to note that Consumers see inflation running at 4.8% while the Government officially says it's 2.1% and, based on that complete and utter BS, they are only raising Social Security benefits by 1.6% in 2020 (it was 2.8% in 2019).

That 1.2% drop may not seem like much – just $24 a month out of a $2,000 benefit payment – but it's $13.2Bn Trump gets to take away from old people so he can give it to his kids, campaign donors and other rich friends.

Here's a quick quiz you can take since we have this budget chart – see if you can find Corporate Taxes? We have a PLANNED $1Tn budget shortfall but, in reality, we passed $1Tn in August already yet, under Trump's Tax Cuts, Corporations are paying just $221Bn (and they are paying less than $200Bn in reality) despite earning $2.25 TRILLION in the first quarter of 2019.

Q2 has been weaker, with just $1.9Tn beind reported so far so you can't expect them to come up with $13.1Bn (0.7%) just to keep Grandma from having to eat cat food, can you? Once upon a time in America (until the 60s), Corporations used to pay 2/3 (66%) of all tax revenues, now it's 6.3% – ONE TENTH (1/10) of what they used to pay – and they still complain about that! Since they are never going to be happy anyway – why not let Elizabeth Warren loose and give them something real to complain about?

Instead, the Corporations have taken over our Government and they have taken over the courts, which is why they are now considered to be Citizens (see Citizens United), which has given them control of the Senate and they are working on the House and they clearly control the GOP and, if you do want to stop them – this coming election is probably your last chance because we're either going to reverse this tide or it's going to drown us!

Trump isn't the whole problem – he's just a symptom of what's really wrong with this country – Oiligarchy…

European governments often appear to champion low-carbon policies. Yet, in 2017, European Union countries collectively spent US$87 billion subsidising the cost of fossil fuels. Shockingly – at a time when the world needs to act to stop climate change – this is nearly 2.5 times more than they spent in 2010.

This increase in wasteful and environmentally devastating spending has been driven by a significant shift towards dirtier economic and environmental policies in nearly every EU country. And the key offenders contributing to this change have – perhaps surprisingly – been Germany and France. They are actually two of the most vocal proponents of interventionist climate policy.

In general, poor transparency makes it difficult to determine how much money is involved when quantifying fossil fuel subsidies. In my research I’ve developed an indirect method that infers the size of fossil fuel subsidies by comparing how much fossil fuels countries use. Countries that appear to use “too little” fossil fuels are indicative of polices that act like taxes. Conversely, countries using “too much” fossil fuels suggest that subsidies dominate. Using this techniques we can examine the size of subsidies across the EU.

My calculations show how central and eastern European countries have traditionally been the biggest fossil fuel subsidisers in the EU, generating 86% of the total or US$75 billion in 2010. The picture, however, is no longer as clear cut. In 2017, central and eastern European country subsidies accounted for only 50% of the EU’s US$87 billion total.

Over the 2010-17 period, net subsidies increased in southern European countries (especially Spain and Italy) and the Benelux. Still, the largest increase by far came from one of the most vocal critics of climate change. Germany moved from being one of the countries with highest levels of taxes on fossil fuels in 2010 (US$12 billion in 2010), to its second largest subsidiser (US$21 billion in 2017) – right behind Poland (US$26 billion in 2017).

Worryingly, we have also seen a significant shift in French policy. While France indisputably remains the country that taxes fossil fuels the most in the EU, it nonetheless saw one of the greatest falls in tax rates over the period – second only to that of Germany.

Clean energy alternatives



Getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies will improve economic efficiency and provide a reprieve to strained government budgets, while also lowering carbon emissions. My research shows that, had the EU eliminated all subsidies between 2010 and 2017, its emissions would have been 9% lower over the period and would have saved governments across the EU US$441 billion.

To put this figure into context, let’s consider what these savings could have paid for in terms of clean energy.

1) The nuclear option: Many of the changes in carbon policy in the EU over the past decade have been in direct reaction to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. The share of nuclear power in German electrical supply fell from 25% in 2011 to 12% today.

While nuclear power has many downsides, it is very low in carbon emissions. The US$441 billion saved could have been used to build 37 state-of-the-art EPR nuclear reactors, each roughly costing €10.9 billion (about US$12.1 billion) and together producing energy equivalent to the current nuclear capacity of France.

2) Electrifying infrastructure: A shift to electric vehicles can be expensive, as the necessary infrastructure of charging stations makes it difficult for consumers to adopt the newer, cleaner technology.

For the price of fossil-fuel subsidies over the 2010-17 period a network of 1.6m supercharging stations could be built at a cost of US$270,000 each (according to Tesla). By comparison, there are more than 100,000 petrol stations currently in the EU.

The increase in electric infrastructure would help spur the introduction of electric vehicles, reducing carbon from diesel and petrol consumption.

3) Trains, planes or automobiles: The cost of building a kilometre of the most expensive high-speed rail network in France is €20m . With the savings from fossil fuel subsidies, nearly 20,000km of high-speed rail across Europe could have been built.

By comparison, only 9,000km of high-speed lines are currently in use in the EU, and around 1,700km of line was under construction in 2017. The European Environment Agency estimates that rail travel generates only 14g of CO? emissions per passenger-kilometre, versus 158 grams for car journeys and 285 grams for air travel.

4) Tax and retraining: Ask any economist for their solution to reduce carbon emissions and they will likely recommend implementing a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This is a tax that encourages firms and individuals to reduce their carbon emissions in the most efficient way possible – the more they reduce their carbon footprint, the less tax they pay.

But the transition to a lower-carbon economy can be costly. For example, workers may be stuck with old skills or in dying sectors. Shifting them to different sectors may require retraining to help bridge the gap. If we put the cost of this at a generous US$30,000, the cost savings of cutting fossil fuel subsidies could be used to retrain 14.7m workers – that’s nearly half of the 30.4m people employed in manufacturing across the entire EU in 2016.

Growing fossil fuel subsidies in the EU are a dangerous new trend that helps contribute to higher carbon emissions. While, admittedly, subsidies of EU countries are small compared to my calculations for those of Russia (US$217 billion), the US (US$435 billion), or China (US$1.08 trillion), the unprecedented increase over the last decade – and its unexpected source in some of the EU’s historical climate champions – is a particularly grim reminder of the ever-present risk of a coming climate calamity.

Political parties were still haggling over the details early in the week, but Berlin was likely to pledge some €40 billion over four years, newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported.

Measures proposed by Merkel's CDU party include boosting public transport services, making train travel cheaper and flying more expensive, and raising subsidies for cleaner cars and home heating systems.

A bone of contention remained how to price the emission of climate-killer CO2 into economic activity – either through a carbon tax or the trading of emissions permits, the option favoured by Merkel.

""Climate protection is a challenge for humankind,"" she said in her latest weekly podcast. ""We can see that climate change is already a reality. In the past 50 years, storms, heat waves and floods have also tripled in Germany.

""Germany is an industrialized country. In recent decades we have emitted a great deal of CO2 and thus contributed to global warming.""

'Life-destroying crisis'

At the end of Germany's second blistering summer in a row, as fear of climate change has energized especially young voters, the mainstream parties are struggling to catch up on the hot-button issue.

Merkel's government will announce its plan on Friday, a day that's expected to see the biggest international wave of climate strikes yet by the Fridays for Future movement and the hundreds of civic groups that support it.

""We are heading for a life-destroying crisis and so far nothing has happened,"" said Linus Steinmetz of the student movement launched last year by Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg.

""That's why we're raising the pressure – together we're strong.""

Export powerhouse Germany accounts for around two percent of the worldwide emissions blamed for heating the Earth's atmosphere, melting ice caps, raising sea levels and intensifying violent weather events.

Merkel, a scientist by profession, was once known as the ""climate chancellor"" as she pushed forward a green energy transition that vastly increased clean renewables such as wind and solar power.

However, many of those gains have been eroded by an increased reliance on dirty coal, in part to offset the phase-out by 2022 of nuclear power that Merkel decided after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Car-mad Germany has also lagged badly behind in the transport sector, where state-coddled auto giants VW, Daimler and BMW have long focused on gas-guzzling SUVs more than on hybrid or zero-emission electric cars.

'No fig leaf'

While the details of the climate plan remained hazy, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz promised a ""very ambitious"" package.

""I can feel the will of all coalition partners to actually achieve something that does justice to the scope of the challenge,"" he said on ZDF public television.

Speaking separately to Bild am Sonntag newspaper, Scholz suggested that a switch to electric cars could be boosted with ""something like a one-million-charging-station programme"".

Scholz's Social Democrats, junior coalition partners to Merkel's conservatives, have also called for a broad carbon tax, which would raise the cost of goods and services reliant on fossil fuels.

Merkel's bloc has, however, resisted this, perhaps mindful of how a French plan for a climate levy helped spark the ""yellow vests"" protest movement.

Her party instead advocates extending the trade in right-to-pollute emission certificates to the transport and building sectors.

The climate package presents a delicate balancing act for the two mainstream parties, which have been under fire from both the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the ascendant Greens.

On the one hand, the anti-immigration AfD, which is strongest in the ex-communist east, rails against Merkel's government, wind energy farms and the planned closure of Germany's last coal mines.

On the other hand the Greens' popular co-leader Robert Habeck warned against any half-hearted ""fig-leaf policy"" on climate and demanded more concrete steps, such as a deadline for banning petrol and diesel cars.

Columnist

If your country can’t figure this out, what hope is there for mine?

I kept wondering this as I met here with Notre Affaire à Tous, one of four organizations suing the French government for failing to keep its Paris climate accord commitments.

In France, unlike in the United States, politicians actually want to lead on this existential crisis. Their constituents know climate change is real, and they are genuinely alarmed by it: Eighty-three percent think climate change is a “major threat” to their country, according to Pew Research Center. In the United States, the share is just 59 percent.

Here, climate marches are frequent and well attended. Here, the Green Party recently became the country’s third- largest contingent in the European Parliament. Here, needless to say, the Paris climate accord was negotiated.

And yet.

When the French government recently attempted to expand its carbon tax — the tool economists consider most effective at curbing use of carbon-intensive technologies and jump-starting green innovation — it failed spectacularly.

Last fall, shortly before a fuel-tax increase was set to take effect, protests and riots erupted. Demonstrators donned the reflective vests all French motorists must keep in their cars, earning them the name gilets jaunes, or yellow vests. Yellow vests viewed raising the fuel tax as callous, regressive, elitist.

“Macron is concerned with the end of the world,” one slogan puts it, referring to French President Emmanuel Macron. “We are concerned with the end of the month.”

Macron eventually capitulated, not only suspending the tax but also offering other concessions, such as more generous pensions.

And so the country’s more ambitious climate plans got put on the back burner. Meanwhile, many of its other climate actions have proved relatively inconsequential.

The government has banned drilling and fracking in French territories by 2040, for instance. Sounds impressive, until you realize 99 percent of the country’s hydrocarbons are already imported.

The government has proposed a plan to make the country carbon-neutral by 2050. But that, too, fudges how “carbon neutrality” is calculated and puts off some of the most politically unpopular measures.

Hence that climate lawsuit, dubbed l’affaire du siècle — the case of the century.

Announced in December, the suit accuses the government of violating the climate accord, as well as other domestic and international laws requiring more action.

“In France, we are famous for this, to talk and have many discussions and to not advance in one way or another,” said Paul Mougeolle, a project coordinator and jurist at Notre Affaire à Tous. “Of course it’s difficult, and we don’t have enough time, but that’s why we’re trying to sue the state and the companies in order to force them to make change more rapidly.”

But to give you a sense of how politically toxic those more ambitious climate actions are, note that even Notre Affaire à Tous has not endorsed a carbon tax.

Mougeolle says the timing of the legal action, just days after Macron caved on the fuel tax, was coincidental; Mougeolle’s organization, too, has reservations about the distributional impact of such a tax, at least as currently designed.

Given all this, it’s easy to become demoralized about whether the United States, with a much larger carbon footprint and a much less climate-concerned populace, can make progress. But the better response is to study where France went wrong and adapt.

For example, there’s the flawed design of France’s carbon tax.

The government chose to use most of the tax revenue to pay down the budget deficit. Instead, it should have rebated the money to the public, most generously to those least able to either absorb the tax (the poor) or reduce their carbon emissions (those in suburbs and rural areas).

Additionally, there’s the broader policy context and political framing to consider.

Macron, recall, has backed tax cuts for the rich and safety-net cuts. In a country as égalité-obsessed as France, this combination of policy changes was almost inevitably going to play into an angry narrative that the former investment-banker president disdains the common man.

Which is presumably one reason the yellow vests have persisted, long after the government tabled the fuel tax. The movement was never just about carbon taxes; it’s more a primal scream, with a nebulous agenda based on populism, nationalist nostalgia and frustration with income stagnation.

There’s no way around it: Some of what’s necessary to curb climate change will cause pain, especially in the near term. But there are ways to reduce that pain, economically and politically — especially relative to the economic and political pain sure to come from doing nothing."

To put this figure into context, let’s consider what these savings could have paid for in terms of clean energy.

1) The nuclear option: Many of the changes in carbon policy in the EU over the past decade have been in direct reaction to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. The share of nuclear power in German electrical supply fell from 25% in 2011 to 12% today.

While nuclear power has many downsides, it is very low in carbon emissions. The US$441 billion saved could have been used to build 37 state-of-the-art EPR nuclear reactors, each roughly costing €10.9 billion (about US$12.1 billion) and together producing energy equivalent to the current nuclear capacity of France.

2) Electrifying infrastructure: A shift to electric vehicles can be expensive, as the necessary infrastructure of charging stations makes it difficult for consumers to adopt the newer, cleaner technology.

For the price of fossil-fuel subsidies over the 2010-17 period a network of 1.6m supercharging stations could be built at a cost of US$270,000 each (according to Tesla). By comparison, there are more than 100,000 petrol stations currently in the EU.

The increase in electric infrastructure would help spur the introduction of electric vehicles, reducing carbon from diesel and petrol consumption.

3) Trains, planes or automobiles: The cost of building a kilometre of the most expensive high-speed rail network in France is €20m . With the savings from fossil fuel subsidies, nearly 20,000km of high-speed rail across Europe could have been built.

By comparison, only 9,000km of high-speed lines are currently in use in the EU, and around 1,700km of line was under construction in 2017. The European Environment Agency estimates that rail travel generates only 14g of CO? emissions per passenger-kilometre, versus 158 grams for car journeys and 285 grams for air travel.

4) Tax and retraining: Ask any economist for their solution to reduce carbon emissions and they will likely recommend implementing a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This is a tax that encourages firms and individuals to reduce their carbon emissions in the most efficient way possible – the more they reduce their carbon footprint, the less tax they pay.

But the transition to a lower-carbon economy can be costly. For example, workers may be stuck with old skills or in dying sectors. Shifting them to different sectors may require retraining to help bridge the gap. If we put the cost of this at a generous US$30,000, the cost savings of cutting fossil fuel subsidies could be used to retrain 14.7m workers – that’s nearly half of the 30.4m people employed in manufacturing across the entire EU in 2016.

Growing fossil fuel subsidies in the EU are a dangerous new trend that helps contribute to higher carbon emissions. While, admittedly, subsidies of EU countries are small compared to my calculations for those of Russia (US$217 billion), the US (US$435 billion), or China (US$1.08 trillion), the unprecedented increase over the last decade – and its unexpected source in some of the EU’s historical climate champions – is a particularly grim reminder of the ever-present risk of a coming climate calamity.

It all helps the mental and emotional discipline of the trading too. So thanks again. Roro

As a retired stockbroker from a major Canadian brokerage firm, I can tell you I would never had access to these type of trade ideas, especially the hedges. Just closed out a July TZA 40/45 call spread today for a 271% gain in less than a month. I would have normally let that run but yesterday Phil commented to another member something to the effect that ""you put down a $1 for a $5 upside, now that you are up 250% you have $2.5 in and you are hoping for a double."" Just closed out a USO July $38 put that Phil suggested yesterday for a 49% one day gain. Thanks, Bob RJK

Phil, I have to hand it to you. It seemed that you were the only person on the planet that thought stocks falling was still possible. I am glad I listened. About the end of the year I was really beginning to second guess though. Thanks for suggesting taking some profits last Nov. It no longer looks like I missed much. rj_jarboe

Phil/ et al- Thanks for the answers to my spread questions last night, as I really needed that little piece of knowledge to crystallize my understanding of spreads. Your help is much appreciated and I have been doing really well for the last couple of months with fewer and fewer missteps as I embrace the PSW ways and watching my portfolios grow. Craigsa620

Phil: Thank You! Scaling, Scaling, and Scaling… then patience, patience, patience I'm 2 to 1 short and even on a day the broad market is up I had my largest one day gain in years. The last 6 weeks in fact have been great. I really feel I've learned to use some tools that will enable me to deal with the turbulence ahead. Selling short calls is definitely my preferred approach. Even allowed me to play golf this afternoon while the premium melted away and shoot a career low round. I owe you man! Lincoln

Fed days are fun! Just for grins I decided to see how much money I could make in two clicks. I bought DIA calls right when the surge started and then sold them the minute they hit my account. Net gain of 20% in 20 seconds. Can't do that very often… MrMocha

I discovered PSW while reading up on the US economy and how it applies to all the poor folk of the world and to myself as a humble UK desk slave. This year I put time into learning options trading. I upgraded (with great administrative difficulty!) my stock dealing account to deal options. Now I am an avid reader of PSW and subscribed for voyeur membership. Initially feeling out of my depth struggling to keep up with the peculiar language of options traders, I unsubscribed feeling a little under confident and uncertain if the small stake I have to invest in options could generate enough to justify my PSW subscription. Nevertheless, I've benefited considerably from the member's material. From a small number of initial trades, I've exceeded profit targets enough to consider re-subscribing in some capacity. Thanks for the knowledge and more than anything I appreciate the human angle, the humour and the ecologically sympathetic approach rarely seen in other financial media. Best wishes all - Jon Jon

Phil – BTW, the new STP/LTP coupled with the income portfolio is Perfect! I do not trade all of them, very few actually since I work during market hours. However, following the trades real-time is very educational. I did enter the ABX call if you recall, I rolled to July on that nonsense news that sent it tumbling. Out today for 110% gain (2.00 stop) not counting covering the loss from the earlier roll. Nonetheless, a good trade. Keep it up…. Thanks JFawcett

The strategy you have laid out pretty much mirrors much of my trading activity. I also mix in some momentum plays and ""drop dead"" bargains that come across my radar. My YTD trading profit is 63%. Back in March when Phil said ""unless you think the world is coming to an end, then NOW is the time to start taking positions in Buy/Writes with the VIX so high."" I jumped in with both feet - ( thanks, again Phil) Chaps

Thank you Phil we appreciate all the work you put in to teach us valuable lessons about investing. Pat Swap

Way to go Phil! Have I said how much I appreciate your site lately! Your ability to teach and your willingless to give others a forum to demonstrate their own skill sets makes your site remarkable. I got great help from you, jmm1951, and Iflantheman (special thanks!) today. Hell, if I have many more days like this I may even be able to sign up for a full year rather than doing it just quarterly. Tomorrow is another day but, fabulous job today! dclark41

I remember that call (to sell gold at $1,850) as well... and the many Buy-Writes that were created on your site during that period... thanks to you, I had an average ROI of close to 70% for over 2 years, averaging 4,000 trades per year. Busy trading, but lots of fun and memorable trades. 1234gel

My watch list looks like a grid where Phil's recommendations went UP and everything else went DOWN! It looked something like an ad for Philstockworld. I am half in cash, followed the recommendations (AAPL TASR YHOO) on a 20K portfolio and still up 1% for the day. Thanks! Sn0gr00ve

Phil – In the event of a mkt meltdown, which of the indices, in your opinion do you think has the most potential for % move down. I'm looking at call options on SDS and the DXD. Any thoughts? Ideas? Thanks .. and thanks for being a great teacher! I've learned so much in only a month! Louis631

Aapl/Phil Thanks for your advice, always appreciated. So, not so much a tax issue, but more to protect against a 5% or greater drop. Here is what I did before their earnings…sold 25% of my stock at 147.50 Against the rest, I sold the June $140 calls for $8.25, protecting down to $140 if needed. And just for fun, I bought the weekly $145 puts for $1.50( small price to pay if they bombed on earnings) So, overall, I am happy with the insurance I was able to 'generate' for 1% of the price of stock. Now, depending on what happens, I have the luxury of deciding and being in the driver's seat with respect to whether to sell and buy your spreads or not. Having done all that meandering, I must say it was fun! More important, I could not have done something like that 2 or 3 years ago and reading and thinking about your teachings has been a tremendous asset. Thanks! Maya1

Market manipulation…. One of the things I've gained from this site is the concept of market manipulation. I never thought it was so prevalent, but now I know it is. I actually consider its effect when I make trades. Several days ago, when AAPL was moving toward 220 I sold 210 calls. My reasoning was that they will probably pin this month at 210. They came in big time as the stock moved ever closer to 210. I agree with Phil's comment that one of the things we need to do is find out what they are manipulating, and how, and hitch a ride. They are doing this with several equities. I've actually seen one article describing several equities that were being manipulated to pin at expiration each month, and describing how it was done, and of course Phil has described it well. In some ways it's easier to figure this out than it is a ‘normal' market behavior, and thus easier to make money in certain equities. Iflantheman

Phil I must say that it was really nice to have a portfolio that was looking very stable in the face of a rough day for the markets. I ended the day up 0.3% which includes another successful day of futures trading. So with a portfolio of mostly cash, a few of our faves like Apple and LL, JO, TOL, DIS, etc., along with a couple of hedges that paid off nicely today, and my futures trades, I never had to break a sweat during that madhouse today. Yes, by George (or Phil), I may be learning this system! Craig

Phil – I wanted to tell you how much of a privilege it is to learn from your every day. You are a shining beacon in the life of so many investors. You have assembled probably the best group of people in the history of financial blogging and you, yourself have done more to help investors in the last 6 months than all previous financial advisors combined. StJeanLuc

I have to thank you for excelling yourself during this past week. I have spent a good few hours going over your notes and comments and there are so many gems on repairing and rolling trades that I have been beavering away on paying special attention to my major positions and analysing them using your approach on Tuesday. Being able to look at a group of trades on the same underlying (in this case AAPL) and taking a detached view by assessing the impact of the underlying reaching different price points was extremely reassuring. Winston

10/15/2014: Phil…..been travelling more than not but reading and watching you guys every night. This is to say a big thank you. Even though I don't have the time to trade every day now I set up hedges and base long term strategy on PSW. I now it may sound like BS to some readers but my 401k is down a mere 3%. It hardly gets my attention when I open my brokerage portfolio accounts. And that is by using your longer term hedges and strategies. I don't need to be a day trader to take advantage of PSW. At this time in my life when I cant trade every day……. not losing what we've gained moves front and center. It's just a great feeling to watch your brokerage account hold steady in a sea of red. Thanks Teacher. Livingfull

Thank God for Phil. A few months ago (April) I didn´t even know what hedging was, and someone recommended I should check out some of Phil´s plays, especially on the retirement portfolio. When I first started to read it, none of it made a blind bit of sense to me, but I stuck with it and gradually began to work through some of the trades to see how it worked. Now I am putting on 5:1 SPY backspreads combined with bear put spreads, entering and leaving positions after consulting the VIX, and engaging in other esoteric maneuvers that are keeping my portfolio above water. jmm1951

Took profit on QQQ 57 Puts, bot 40 at $0.07, sold 20 for $0.15 and 20 for $0.32. Thank, Phil Bobhu

Peter D: great write-up for Short Strangles, Part 1, looking forward to Part 2, particularly the adjustment part. RMM

Bought some QQQ's today on the dip. Added a little bit more to my son's account. Up about 8% in 2 months! I think I've learned some stuff here. Thanks to all that contribute, and of course to the boss. Thanks Phil! JeffDoc

HOTT / Got great trades with it: Enter 6.75 at open, out at 7.18 (avg) at 10:13 Reentered at 7.00 and out all 7.11 few minutes ago- Was a small play but I collected enoght for next month PSW subscription. Spider

Being on this board is better than successfully completing the Times crossword. Phil's panoply of comments manage to excite, illuminate, frustrate, exasperate, confuse, enlighten, outrage, invigorate and stupefy (and that's par for the morning session only!). But goddammit, it's addictive, informative and when it all goes right extremely profitable. Winston

Sold out my AAPL mar95 calls. Up over 100% today on them! Singapore Steve

GIVE THANKS/PHIL Have not done my 10,000 hours, but a couple of years at PSW, and moved from fishing with a single line to owner of a commercial trawler (metaphorically speaking). Now I fish with many lines. It is amazing when you go over the same information time and time again, eventually it clicks. Like planting trees; being the house, 20% sale items, selling into the excitement. and patience. I just sold an AAPL Jan 12 340/390 BCS financed by the sales of Jan 12 275 Put. The trade was put on one year ago for a net credit and exited five minutes ago for a 49 dollar per contract profit. No point in waiting till opex to see what happens, and I will just sell 10 of those VLO puts to make myself net the round 50. I no longer worry about opex coming as I have adjusted well in time for most positions that go against me. I still make some howlers (RIMM, TBT, TRGT) but I play the percentages and my winners outdistance my losers by many miles. I would never be in this position if it were not for Phil. He is a treasure, pure and simple. The goose that lays the golden egg if we care to listen and practice. Phil, a mighty big thank you. Winston

Wishing Phil and all fellow PSW members a Happy, Healthy and Prosperous New Year 2017! Thanks to all of you for your insights and comments which help make me a better investor every day. Wishing everybody the best of luck for 2017 Learner"

Of all the contributors on SA, he offers the most actual and ready to implement advice that has put money in my account. Many of us on SA actually are sad when we don't see Phil's postings for an extended period. Brenteaz

Gel1…..I've been here 6 months, mostly watching and learning. Lots of smart people on the site and I've learned a lot from Phil and many others. //// Inflan - I have to trump your sentiments regarding the wisdom of the board. I have to thank Phil and the many contruibutors for a 80% profit for 2009. I have learned a lot and am still learning ( even occasionally about political issues - ha! ) Iflantheman & Gel1

100KP dividend plays - FYI, I'm loving them...thanks, Phil!!! Including the $0.848/share dividend, I am up 100% on my $2.38 net entry on LYG...that's pretty cool! SSDirk

Phil - Moved today to send kudos. You're in my top 5 to see/read daily. I do not trade... but as former econ-finance adjunct faculty near Stanford U. I give you lots of attaboys.... and provide your links to many to spread some understanding of the mess we are in. Best to you and yours, HJ Kobbeman

Started my membership in mid-Oct and have since then learned so much about options by reading the site's articles and postings, members' chats and suggested trades – as a bonus, the articles are entertaining as well! Phil's long-term investing strategy makes really good sense as I've seen its effect on my GLW positions. Phil – thanks for sharing your knowledge of the market! I've worked as risk analyst for the investment dept of a $19B insurance company, and the scope and depth of your daily commentaries blows away what I have seen and heard from the PMs and even the chief investment officer! Most of all, I will continue to be a member because you have your priorities right (from my POV) – it's not all about money and power. Bai2r

Being a bear is easy (and I am not convinced we are doing all that well on the whole as an economy), but one cannot fight the trend (didn't Phil say that a while ago)? Just cover, make 5-10-15-20% and move on. It really does add up by chipping away. All I can say is I am back to 2007 levels in my account b'f the crash with this run up and some very nice help on this board….so kudos to us (and me!!)… Pharmboy

GOOG, NFLX and AAPL all bought last hour Friday. Sold into the excitement the first hour today for an average of 15% on the options. And lots of them. Thanks again Phil for teaching me so well. lflantheman

Phil, I just wanted to say thanks for being there. The world needs more of you. Your site continues to positively change my life daily. Chasw

I doubled down on our USO June $35 puts on Tuesday afternoon and listened to your posting yesterday and sold 1/2 midday and the rest I sold (luckily) at the top of the market yesterday with the last 1/4 of my contracts at 100% return in less than one day! Samlawyer

Phil – great calls this past week, esp. friday and monday. in the old days I would have let Prechter et al scare me into trimming my longs and going short at just the wrong time. your feel for the markets is Tiger-esque. CHK, HOV, BX, TLT and XLF are big winners for me today. My biggest up day in a long time. Thanks! Terrapin22

Phil - I just referred 10 people. Last week was a 50% gainer for me. There are companies that want to sell mentoring service for thousands of dollars. This is far better of a deal with very good advice. Steve

It is amazing how much confidence you engender, Phil………..I knew the 1% a day trades and repeated often were possible as I had done in stretches, and I knew kill zone trades were also possible and 5% to 10% returns per month were very possible with practice, experience and smart risk management all without having to take a lot of risk, but I guess I was talking to the disbelievers and since I have dropped them into my 'why bother to try to explain it' file and come over to the dark side at PSW I feel soooo much more content not only with the returns, but with the company and a comments and the obvious opportunity to learn and learn and learn some more. It all helps the mental and emotional discipline of the trading too. So thanks again. Roro

I traded with Phil for approximately three years, and consistently averaged 80% returns yearly... some of which was due to my skills as a trader, but much was a direct result of what I learned as a member of Phil's site.... both from Phil, and the many talented traders that hang out there. Phil... if you are reading along... thanks, again for the approximately $ 3 mil I made tagging along with you.... in order to make you feel good for the work you did... I gave the government 50% of it all, so you made your contribution.... 1234Gel

GLD I took out my callers and rolled down my longs this morning, woo hoo! Ephmen85

Phil, have to thank you for saving me today. I think the discipline I have learned from this site has helped me as much if not more than the actual picks. Rustle123

Phil – Not that you dont usually, but you have DEFINITELY earned your money this week. THe recommendations have been PERFECT. Selling into the initial excitement (MULTIPLE TIMES), hedges, everything. Im reading this when I get home from work and want to cry b/c I cant trade at work! I might have to start getting up at 3 AM though to catch those trades bc youre killing it then too!

A truly great website with a lot of information for investors. Whether you are a novice, seasoned, or a professional there is a lot to be gained about stock options and options trading from this very informative website. ZKatkin

Phil, thank you for all the education here. I've gained so much knowledge being a part of PSW. Thanks to the rest of the members as well! I appreciate all of the contributions you make. JeffDoc

New members – a word of advice: you should check out the track record of Phil's last few trades of the year, and what the return would be if you just rolled all the gains into the next years trade of the year. Remember – trade of the year is one he's virtually sure of, and he rarely misses on those Deano

Hi Mr. Phill, I am a Venezuelan lady tormented by our politicall situation, who use to be an emerging market trader, and many other executive positins in the finance ""arena"" and now is trying to built a new concept and service for asset management for clients on my own, I am in the trial and learning process at the moment, I also invest for some friends and myself. I want to congratulate you , because reading you fill my days with a touch of irony (besides ,of course the spectacular market insight) that happens to give me energy, its a joy the remarks and comments even the pictures used, sometimes I just read it for the fun, I completily agree with your thouhts, though we belong to totally different cultures and enviorements and certanly realities Your readings is like a little hand helping me out to be in the market and fight for my devastated country where every single day we looe inches and yards of liberty. You shoul try to writte a book! Mindeyes

I don't post much, but I guess this morning has brought me out. This site has made me tens of thousands, every year since I have become a member. It took me nearly two years devoting 3 hours per day to get on the ball, and actually understand portion sizing, and which trades fit my personal trading style. Before that I spent at least two years working on Buffet style fundamental investing. (Intellegent Investor, Security Analysis, ect.). This site really will teach you amazing things if you just pay attention. Literally it has changed my day to day life, has allowed my family and I to move back to the U.S. from overseas with confidence even with a paycut at my day job, and literally put me in a different league financially. Seriously my life and my children's is better because of this site. Knightpilot

Phil- I want to let you know that you really helped me make some money this morning when I probably would have lost on my own. I was stuck in doctors waiting rooms most of the morning starting at 8AM. By following the game plan you laid out and using my smartphone, I went short on oil whenever we got to 61.50 and long at 61 waiting for the spikes ahead of inventory. When 10:30 rolled around I was out after selling longs at 61.60 a few minutes earlier. I went short at 61.75-61.80 and voila, rode it down to 60.60 or so. Thank you. craigsa620

Kudos on the POT puts! I studied the charts last night and you couldn't have hit the inflection points more perfectly. Since there are often many head fakes in the charts, that was very well done. I know they can't all work this well, but that was an extra unexpected bonus yesterday. Ocelli7

I subscribed to Phils Stock World full service for a year or so and found that it was extremely helpful. Now I just get the Stock World Weekly summary, which I find invaluable. Phil does not baby people and certainly can't make someone into a successful stock operator who does not make the effort on their own behalf, but he is extremely generous with his time in answering newbie questions. Although I found it difficult to follow and implement all his trades in real time, what I did find was that once you got the hang of his methodology and way of thinking, you could work out your own trades and be quite successful. Even just using his patent Rule Number One* alone is worth its weight in gold. Rule Number Two is even better. Rookie IRA Investor

WISH TO EXTEND A BIG THANK YOU! I netted about $18,000 on the short Jan puts and the annualized ROI/M is mind boggling! Hope to meet you some day and buy you and your significant other a nice dinner. Best Regards Newt Newthugger

Thanks, Phil!!! I just crushed today with it with silver (SLV) calls today, thanks to your persistent reminders of how ridiculously cheap it has become, and watching my TSLA this week $240 puts dissolve into chump change added an extra note of amusement. Zeroxzero

The virtuous trade / Phil throws out so many ideas, that understandably he rejects all calls for a running total of how all """"quoted"""" ideas are performing – it would be unworkable. But without such a list, I think it behooves us to call out the trades that have made a difference. January 13 expiration is going to be a big month for me as a significant number of sold put positions will expire worthless. One example of the power of patience and leaving well alone: VLO – sold Jan 13, 17.5 puts for $3.45 – and this trade was placed in August 2011. VLO is currently a tad over $35! And as time went by, and I got more experienced – with the help of Phil and the contributions from board members, I started selling short term puts and calls around this position. Sometimes having to roll, sometimes doubling down but always knowing what I was getting into, and feeling very calm and focussed that whatever happened I could handle it. And if I couldn't then there was always Phil to lend a helping hand. All in all, my profits since August 2011 would qualify as a tidy addition to any earnings from the day job. Thank you Sir. Winston

Speaking of the ""Man Who Planted Trees"", it really works. I bought BTU back in March at $49.87. I practically bought it at the tippy top. However, I soon afterward found this site, started learning Phil's methodology(and those in the strategy section) and began selling calls/puts regularly against my bad position. As of yesterday, I still own the original 100 shares, but have brought my basis down by over $11.00. Couldn't be happier, what started out as a really bad entry, I have managed to work down to a good basis. Had I not watched that video and learned your system, I would sold out of the position, and been kicking myself for making such a bad entry. Hoss"

I am a Registered Nurse, so is my wife. We work hard to take care of seven kids that are the joy of our lives.

Phil - DIA 107 Calls. As suggested I am taking the money and running to home depot for some shelter supplies! This is the grand finale of several successful trades from you through this roller-coster and as you have further suggested it is time for me to sit back and relax in cash. May even be able to talk my wife into the premium membership after these intelligent trades in a stupid market. DOStrade

I read with great interest your statement the other day that the DX is unlikely to break 76 or there will be great hell to pay, torrential amounts of tears shed, and gnashing of dentures all over the world. Well. I have had several short DX contracts in the $78ish range during the last month and upon your two statements 1) don't be greedy, and 2) 76 could be a bottom, I yesterday put a buy GTC order to close my positions at 76 and for some inexplicable reason the DX spiked down after the close and now I can safely say that once again you have confirmed for me that you have been one of the best investment services I have yet to come across. Almost to the point that I'm beginning to think that maybe I'm completely wrong about my political stance as well. Almost. In any event, I wanted you to know that this has been my third execution based on your comments and recommendations that I have followed and this one has also worked to my advantage. My subscription fee has been more than justified for the next year and there's some left over to pay for my stay in Toronto this week, dinner at Joso's in the Yorkville section of town. If I smoked I'd have a Montecristo to salute you. Be well, stay well. Flipspiceland

Aapl/Phil Thanks for your advice, always appreciated. So, not so much a tax issue, but more to protect against a 5% or greater drop. Here is what I did before their earnings…sold 25% of my stock at 147.50 Against the rest, I sold the June $140 calls for $8.25, protecting down to $140 if needed. And just for fun, I bought the weekly $145 puts for $1.50( small price to pay if they bombed on earnings) So, overall, I am happy with the insurance I was able to 'generate' for 1% of the price of stock. Now, depending on what happens, I have the luxury of deciding and being in the driver's seat with respect to whether to sell and buy your spreads or not. Having done all that meandering, I must say it was fun! More important, I could not have done something like that 2 or 3 years ago and reading and thinking about your teachings has been a tremendous asset. Thanks! Maya1

Phil, I've got to give you props on the ICE spread play. Tremendous call! I jumped in on Friday when you made the recommendation and closed out today. Nice 57% return ($2,300) over a mere 3 trading days! This is why I dig your site! Samlawyer

Very nice in and out on those USO puts again, easy way to get the subscription covered in just a couple of hours. Thanks again Phil and everyone here contributing to such intelligent and informative discussion! I have wasted countless hours reading ""professional newsletters"" and message board blather over the years. Have learned a great deal here in a very short time. I have sent out a number of invites to friends and family for stockworld! Eyezz

I have been trading for quite a few years and in good years made about 25%. After joining PSW, I followed closely the PSW strategy and my trading profit for this year is close to 70% to date. For fun, I like to mix in a few ""Hail Mary"" plays that really worked out well, but overall the simpler Buy/Write strategy, as presented by Phil so often, created the majority of the profit. Gel1

Phil: Thank You! Scaling, Scaling, and Scaling… then patience, patience, patience I'm 2 to 1 short and even on a day the broad market is up I had my largest one day gain in years. The last 6 weeks in fact have been great. I really feel I've learned to use some tools that will enable me to deal with the turbulence ahead. Selling short calls is definitely my preferred approach. Even allowed me to play golf this afternoon while the premium melted away and shoot a career low round. I owe you man! Lincoln

Phil - It is nice being more discipline with my trading. Generally, I am out earlier than most, but my results, overall, are much better than they were when I was trying to squeeze 80 cups of lemonade out of one lemon! On the other side, I am learning the value of rolling and turning losses into non-losses or small gains. I so appreciate the time you have spent with me and others who have benefited greatly from your knowledge. Thank you! Dclark41

I have been reading the ""free"" PSW for about a year and have always liked Phil's style as it closely resembled the way I like to trade (mostly naked put options). I have been a paid subscriber for about 5 weeks and I have been learning a lot from Phil and other members. I had made some money on Phil's ""free"" ideas in the past and I joined because one of Phil's futures ideas paid for my subscription within the same day (NG). Phil deserved my subscription and I was eager to learn more. I just did a quick tally and within the last 5 weeks the ideas that I chose to follow from Phil generated over 25K in options profits and 12K in futures profits (some of my trades were more conservative than what Phil's had suggested). I have a lot to learn, experience and confidence to gain. Thanks again Phil and Successful Trading to all. Verreaul

Phil - I caught the interview…. terrific!. Your host recommended that the viewers should "" go to your site, as you will be entertained "". That is for sure if you consider entertainment is laughing while you read, learn and make unbelievable leveraged profits that you never thought were possible. That is my kind of entertainment ! Gel1

Phil- great call in oil this morning! Now that Im no longer studying and am back in the real world I can only check this in the morning, at lunch, and after work. Anyways, you've been killing it on oil ( even more than you usually do) so I made a point to wake up extra early and made .25 off your ‘buy oil if you're brave'recommendation. It's nice to wake up and scalp 100+ bucks before I even start my real job. You lay those golden eggs everyday Phil! I thank you for that! Jromeha

thanks for the DNDN recommendation last week phil. that was moneeeee…. Kwan

On Optrader's section yesterday he was asked how he works with AAPL as an investment. He replied that he just ‘plays with the covers'. I've got a separate portfolio where I use primarily this technique over the past 6 months. Up 60% The principles involved are stock selection, patience, patience, using covers to protect profits, rolling covers to maximize premium return, and exiting when covers are gone and stock price is high. Sometimes it's hard to remember where you learn to do this stuff, but much of it is from integrating principles I've learned here with thing I already knew. Thanks for the help on this, Phil and others. Iflantheman

Phil, Passed a milestone today since joining 2 months ago. 25% of my account is in buy/writes, bull call spreads and disaster hedges. A majority of the trades were taken directly from your ideas or someone else`s contributions. Some were daytrades that became spreads. That part of my account is up 30% as of today. I don`t worry about it, or mess with it much, did a few rolls etc. Rest of the account is there to day trade, cover the writes and take advantage of opportunities. Thanks to everyone who contributes here, what a sweet way to trade, so many opportunities. Ben1Be

It is amazing how much confidence you engender, Phil………..I knew the 1% a day trades and repeated often were possible as I had done in stretches, and I knew kill zone trades were also possible and 5% to 10% returns per month were very possible with practice, experience and smart risk management all without having to take a lot of risk, but I guess I was talking to the disbelievers and since I have dropped them into my 'why bother to try to explain it' file and come over to the dark side at PSW I feel soooo much more content not only with the returns, but with the company and a comments and the obvious opportunity to learn and learn and learn some more. It all helps the mental and emotional discipline of the trading too. So thanks again. Roro

Phil - Thanks for the welcoming gift of the POT at a buck Just paid for this month and my membership is not even 24 hours old! looking forward to many more - bk Bjkeck

TBT - Many thanks, Phil. I join you in your opinion favoring the Jan expirations. That's a great play. I can never thank you enough for what I have gained educationally as well as monitarily. Here it is late Sunday evening and I am able to get world class advice, just by asking for it. I feel like I am staying in a 5 star hotel, and room service is just a telephone call away! Gel1

I am not a user of phil's site now, but was for a couple years. His advice and information is excellent. Perhaps even better, you get access to real-time trades of additional traders on his site (OptTrader, etc) and the other members who post what they are buying and selling. Overall, its a very valuable information tool. Expensive, but paid for itself many times over. I did not renew my membership because I switched jobs and did not have time to trade nearly as much. XRTrader

I have been very fortunate over the years as an investor. Last year was on of my best in terms of percentage gains. I have to attribute much of this success to my membership in PSW which gave me the best education available anywhere when it comes to the understanding of option trading , discipline and general trading strategies. I will be forever grateful to Phil and the many ""highly skilled"" traders that have offered their advice. Gel1

This is my first month here. Today was a money train with futures. I gained 7500 USD with KC, RB, CL, NG. I took RB almost every direction up and down. And I only used 1 contract or maximum 2. Thank you. I think it was a good investment to subscribe… Kgabor"
1232,,https://thereformedbroker.com/2019/09/23/green-new-deal-is-inevitable/,2019-09-23T00:00:00,Green New Deal is Inevitable,"It’s hard to scare the youth out of economic policies that will jeopardize the 401(k)s of their parents or even the prospects for their own employment. The main reason is that they’re even more afraid that they might not have an inhabitable planet to live on. Survival has a way of cutting through the bullshit.

Here’s Eric Peters:

“You know it’s time for change when children act like leaders and leaders act like children,” read the hand-painted placards in Bangladesh and Berlin. “There is no Planet B,” read signs in Sydney and Santiago. “We are skipping our lessons to teach you one,” chanted millions of children, skipping school, in every major nation except for China, which banned the Sept 20th Climate Strike protests. “This is just the beginning. Change is coming – like it or not,” tweeted Greta Thunberg, the 16yr old Swedish climate activist, an emerging environmental icon. And of course, she’s right. Change is our only constant. Earth’s infinitely complex systems are always in flux and connected in ways we are only now beginning to measure, let alone understand. We’ve entered earth’s sixth mass extinction. Insect biomass collapsed by upwards of 75% during the past few decades and is falling 2.5% annually. Some 80% of wild plants rely on insects for pollination; 60% of birds rely on insects for food. 25% of the North American bird population disappeared since 1970. The ocean’s fish population is 50% lower in that time, many commercial species are down 75% or more. Marine mammals, birds and reptile populations are 50% smaller. These statistics are often lost amidst the intense focus on greenhouse emissions which are rising 2.5% per year. Amongst the many unpredictable consequences of such rapid change is the rise of youth activism across the planet. They’re connected and coordinating in ways humanity has never experienced. While our aging central bankers gradually come to terms with the fact they do not understand the complexity of the system that they themselves created, our global youth are forming a new vision of their future. And while it’s notoriously difficult to predict the behavior of such complex systems, it seems a fair bet to expect a global green new deal, funded by bonds, bought by bankers.

Josh here – I’m with Eric. I think it’s a matter of time before the environment becomes the biggest issue for voters in the United States. There are reasonable debates to be had over how much of the change in the climate is for anthropogenic reasons and how much is out of our control – but those debates will not become the main thing. The main thing is that we’ve got a generation of 73 million millennials in the United States and then Gen Z right behind them, and they are going to care about not just their future, but their present. And in the present, the effects of climate change are being felt around the world and here at home.

There will be fortunes lost and fortunes made as the next generation turns rolling back climate change into the centerpiece of our time. It’s good to be aware that this is coming one way or another, soon enough.

I think it is finally sinking in & so I say Thanks teacher for your patience & expertise! I've had a very good week so far & I know it is because of persisting in this learning process that you teach. Pirateinvestor

I am struck by several things over the last few days. First is how level-headed we all are as Greece and China develop. Second is how very helpful it is to see the different trading styles we have, partly because of personal preference and partly because of different stages of development and education. It's very helpful. Well-done, Phil, to have developed this community. Snow

I'd like to wish Phil and everyone else that contributes to this board a very Merry Christmas and happy New Year. The wealth of knowledge on here is incredible, and it has greatly contributed to my understanding of markets, politics, and the world in general. This year was when Phil's teachings all seemed to click in place, and my portfolio's performance shot up, and for that I am very grateful. Thank you! Palotay

Phil, 3 for 3! Sold on initial excitement and made a double on USO, 70% on AMZN and 70% on SPY options from Friday. Thanks and much appreciated for the suggestions. Gingbaum

I must add yet another paen to Phil's ""cash and short"" call, as my TZA shorts are past paying for Similac and Pampers and have now covered all doctors and Mt. Sinai hospital bills for young Charlotte, as TZA took the portfolio up 10%. Zeroxzero

Bought some QQQ's today on the dip. Added a little bit more to my son's account. Up about 8% in 2 months! I think I've learned some stuff here. Thanks to all that contribute, and of course to the boss. Thanks Phil! JeffDoc

I did the same thing via your logic (sold puts that is). I glanced one time and they were already up 15% which is considered a good return for an overnight hold in most circles. This is PSW though and to us it's just another day… Kwan

Phil/ I hope the next 5 year bear market will be as much fun and as profitable as this 5 year bull market. For those who survived 2008/2009, and who imbibed the wisdom of PSW, what a time it has been. Good to have you by my side. I think you are selling yourself short – you need to triple your prices :) Winston

Boring trading – Phil/ Thanks to PSW, my yearly covered-writes are on pace for 15%. Add the long puts and well over 20%… and I look at it once a day and never lose sleep over it. Actually doing better than my trading account at this point (Thanks, summer 2013) Anyway, the point is that anyone with enough money would be wise to do the 20% – 40% stuff and do trading as a hobby… Arivera

Have been a member for about 6 months or there abouts. Signed up for a quarter at first and then for a year. To me, and it's only my opinion, it's an investment and I have made the membership fees back many times over on the strategy advice. Since joining and implementing the strategy of buy/writes and hedges I have cut my portfolio losses for the year and have a really good chance of going positive this year. If I would have continued down the road I was on, I would still have been fumbling around without a strategy and completely inept in what I was doing. I feel now the strategy is working and I am far more comfortable with the risks I am taking. I still have a lot to learn but I feel the fees have been one of the best investments I have made. The returns have been fantastic. Still have problems with the politics but hey nobody is perfect DKGuy

Phil…..You have absolutely NAILED IT! This is not a bull market, nor is it a bear market. It is a Rangeish market, and it's going to stay that way for a long time (the latter is my prediction. I love the word. What I love more is the fact that I've found someone with some investing intelligence greater than mine who can assist me in playing this type of market. Your description today of how it's playing out is right on. I predict some media ‘guru' will steal your word and your description within the next few days and we'll all get to read about what ‘they' discovered about this market. Thanks Phil! Iflantheman

I enjoy your informative materials, Phil... as it is obviously beneficial to so many ""styles"" of trading the markets... long term, swing or day trading the market moves. As a longer term trader, I really like you long term calls, as I for one recognize the difficulty of calling these, because the further out you go in time, projecting price movement becomes more difficult. I have to congratulate you for your accuracy... You called the March 2009 market upward reversal almost to the day, and the AAPL reversal to THE day. Only one who has been a student of the economy and the markets over a period of time could have done this, and so many other accurate calls. I'm sure it was difficult and consistent work, but it did pay off... thanks from one who benefited big time ! 1234Gel

Don't expect to get rich quick here, but you can get easy 30 - 50 % per year, just by buying good stocks at discount (as we often discuss), selling monthly premiums of calls and puts. Tchayipov

AMZN ... thanks Phil; boy did they run a squeeze on everyone there ... made me sweat ... scaling helped! I think AMZN has an 85 handle tomorrow ... maybe lower. Cap

Phil - I celebrate today, having reached my goal for the year, trading in sync with your education and guidance, of 1 million in profit. I learned a lot, achieved much, and am profoundly grateful. To be honest, when I set the goal I thought it was daunting, as I have for many years been an investor in equities but did very little with options. Learning and doing has for me been a blast! I reached my goal by following Phil's strategies - lots of Buy/Writes, covered calls on equities , naked put entries for income production. I did it with 2.5 mil and kept 600,000 in cash in case I got in trouble. I concentrated on stocks (many of my own choosing) that had decent dividends and wrote front month calls against (OTM) which has worked well in this market run. 25% of my gain is in dividends and premium selling, with the balance in appreciation. Gel1

All I can say is — I understand that the Universe sent me to PSW for a reason. So, I'm listening!! …and studying. Your commentary is literally outstanding. …and your members are impressive as well. Seaquill

Phil, have to thank you for saving me today. I think the discipline I have learned from this site has helped me as much if not more than the actual picks. Rustle123

Gel1…..I've been here 6 months, mostly watching and learning. Lots of smart people on the site and I've learned a lot from Phil and many others. //// Inflan - I have to trump your sentiments regarding the wisdom of the board. I have to thank Phil and the many contruibutors for a 80% profit for 2009. I have learned a lot and am still learning ( even occasionally about political issues - ha! ) Iflantheman & Gel1

Why were the analysts wrong? If I were a Japanese investor who purchased US stocks prior to November at Y80 yen to the dollar, with the US market up an average of 15% or more and upon selling the asset I covert dollars to Yen, also realizing an additional 25% gain (one dollar now converts to 100+ Yen rather than the 80 I used at time of purchase), I think I would be unloading US assets also. But analysts never do the math in their articles nor very rarely bring up or discuss the ramifications of currency fluctuations. I don't include Phil in this group as this is a valuable lesson I am learning from him. Denlundy

Thanks for the USO directions today. Made it 3 times (up/down/up) for a very nice win. Doro165

Maya, After years of being pretty good at picking stocks I still managed to lose almost as much as I made.All the reading Phil asked us to do as a new member (And everything else I can get my hands on lately) has revealed my Achilles Heal.Good stock picks do not necessarily make money. My problem was swinging for the fences. Since becoming a member Jan 1 this year and getting into to scaling into small trades I am amazed at the steady profit growth I have experienced already while not worrying about getting killed. And having fun doing it.. Phil, Thanks for the education, the help you give and the chance to learn more and get better. Also thanks to all the members who have answered the few questions I had when your not around. Ricpar

Phil/Eric/Cwan/Matt/Cap/etc.. - I've learned so much from all of you and want to thank you. I'm up 23% this month thanks to all of your advice - Thanks, guys! Josiah

It was a nice day thanks to your help! Made over $1100 shorting TF every time it came up near 1260 and even more by going long oil before inventory under $46 and then waited patiently for the spike up into the close where I shorted it at 47.70 or so. Phil you gave me a road map and I simply followed the signs along the way. Craigsa620

Phil has some great insight into the market. He's given me a different perspective on the market and I know I'm a better trader/investor because of it. I've been trading options since the late 80's and Phil is right. Unless you know what is going to happen (how can you, unless you have insider information), then do what the smart money does - be the house. Remember guys, we're allowed to sell options. If you're afraid to be short, then do a spread to limit your liability. When I think about the money I've made and lost on options, a good approximation is that I win 30% of the time when I do a straight buy; I win about 70% of the time when I do a spread; I win nearly 90% of the time when I sell naked. Autolander

By the way thank you Phil for the DNDN idea. 3x till this morning and will 4x my small investment by next OE THANKS !!!! Microflux

Phil, I've got to give you props on the ICE spread play. Tremendous call! I jumped in on Friday when you made the recommendation and closed out today. Nice 57% return ($2,300) over a mere 3 trading days! This is why I dig your site! Samlawyer

I subscribed to Phils Stock World full service for a year or so and found that it was extremely helpful. Now I just get the Stock World Weekly summary, which I find invaluable. Phil does not baby people and certainly can't make someone into a successful stock operator who does not make the effort on their own behalf, but he is extremely generous with his time in answering newbie questions. Although I found it difficult to follow and implement all his trades in real time, what I did find was that once you got the hang of his methodology and way of thinking, you could work out your own trades and be quite successful. Even just using his patent Rule Number One* alone is worth its weight in gold. Rule Number Two is even better. Rookie IRA Investor

Phil - Your logic not only makes sense, but it made a lot of premium profit for me over the past 12 months. I have recovered much of the massive equity losses of last year. My Monday play is the sale of long term puts on FXI. Love the premium! Gel1

The legendary Phil Davis has done it again with his call to ""get out of the market now"" (12/05/2017).

I have been a ""silent"" member for the past year, and am 1,000 hours into the 10K hours of training (The last week is worth at least 500 hours!). Made lots of mistakes and misunderstood quite a few of Phil's calls, … some actually made money when reversed. The chat (Including the politics) is very engaging (Many great minds with international coverage), and a great companion, while nursing a trade gone wrong, through the night. The webinars (despite technical difficulties) are extremely useful. Thanks for your coaching … it has made me a consistently profitable trader, with a better understanding of what I do not know. Aquila

I am a Registered Nurse, so is my wife. We work hard to take care of seven kids that are the joy of our lives. The cost for a basic membership is ALOT from our our monthly budget of spending and saving…but well worth it! Phil has allowed me to really ramp up the savings we put away for our children's college funds and our retirement. David

Phil – I wanted to tell you how much of a privilege it is to learn from your every day. You are a shining beacon in the life of so many investors. You have assembled probably the best group of people in the history of financial blogging and you, yourself have done more to help investors in the last 6 months than all previous financial advisors combined. StJeanLuc

Phil/USO Adjustment~~ Thanks for showing us the make it even (maybe even profitable) tricks for 'fixing' a losing position. I would have never known the trick if you didn't explain it. The option adjustment techniques are very helpful. Trading stocks would probably never offer that kind of flexibilities! Thanks! Investwizard

Being a bear is easy (and I am not convinced we are doing all that well on the whole as an economy), but one cannot fight the trend (didn't Phil say that a while ago)? Just cover, make 5-10-15-20% and move on. It really does add up by chipping away. All I can say is I am back to 2007 levels in my account b'f the crash with this run up and some very nice help on this board….so kudos to us (and me!!)… Pharmboy

Phil: That NFLX call was awesome. The speed at which NFLX options decayed was precipitous. The blow out spike that allowed me to double and roll my callers to 190(!) and the ridiculous 170 weeklies @3.50 a day away from Op-Ex. The gains I realized in that trade floored me when I took a long at my portfolio value on Friday. What a great way to start the 3rd Quarter. Kinkistyle

Fed days are fun! Just for grins I decided to see how much money I could make in two clicks. I bought DIA calls right when the surge started and then sold them the minute they hit my account. Net gain of 20% in 20 seconds. Can't do that very often… MrMocha

Wishing Phil and all fellow PSW members a Happy, Healthy and Prosperous New Year 2017! Thanks to all of you for your insights and comments which help make me a better investor every day. Wishing everybody the best of luck for 2017 Learner

Your board has been fantastic helping the less experienced (includes me) navigate through all the turmoil. The contributions from your members has been well rounded, objective, and extremely helpful. Sans the politics you have built a fantastic community and that is a tribute to you. I thank you and all fellow members for there contributions over the past few days. Fantastic group! dclark41

Here I have learned and look differently at things. Over the years being with PSW I have first of all learned and gained in knowledge of trading. This to me is one of the biggest gains. I still remember the play on Caesar Palace, paid my trip to Atlanta! Yodi

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! How will I ever do anything else in my life that will compare to the wild ride you get trading an ultra etf in the most volatile sector in the stock market the day before option expiration? Matt1966

I discovered PSW while reading up on the US economy and how it applies to all the poor folk of the world and to myself as a humble UK desk slave. This year I put time into learning options trading. I upgraded (with great administrative difficulty!) my stock dealing account to deal options. Now I am an avid reader of PSW and subscribed for voyeur membership. Initially feeling out of my depth struggling to keep up with the peculiar language of options traders, I unsubscribed feeling a little under confident and uncertain if the small stake I have to invest in options could generate enough to justify my PSW subscription. Nevertheless, I've benefited considerably from the member's material. From a small number of initial trades, I've exceeded profit targets enough to consider re-subscribing in some capacity. Thanks for the knowledge and more than anything I appreciate the human angle, the humour and the ecologically sympathetic approach rarely seen in other financial media. Best wishes all - Jon Jon

Thank God for Phil. A few months ago (April) I didn´t even know what hedging was, and someone recommended I should check out some of Phil´s plays, especially on the retirement portfolio. When I first started to read it, none of it made a blind bit of sense to me, but I stuck with it and gradually began to work through some of the trades to see how it worked. Now I am putting on 5:1 SPY backspreads combined with bear put spreads, entering and leaving positions after consulting the VIX, and engaging in other esoteric maneuvers that are keeping my portfolio above water. jmm1951

Happy Thanksgiving Phil and to your family and associates. Also to all of the other fellow citizens of Phil's Stock World. I am particularly happy and thankful that I clicked on your article in Seeking Alpha a number of years ago. That opened the gate to Phil's Stock World and ""being the house"". My wallet thanks you as does my peace of mind in trading options, stocks and rarely futures. Your liberal views opened up my views—being a boot strapper (pulled myself out of a poor background) I was a CONSERVATIVE—cynical of others who weren't as driven. Now, I am much less so; you have taught me more than how to make money and manage risk. So, again I give thanks to you and the others of PSW!! Newthugger

Brilliant covering of the arcane, the profane , but never the mundane! Easy to understand the reason for your huge following, Phil, and why you have become a must read on my daily agenda. Please accept my complete appreciation. Seeking Truth

We are lucky to be in America and it is great to be part of the PSW tribe. Keeps me thinkin' and gatherin' the profits. ~ 42 % gain in my trading account year to date, which keeps me happy. Half to a third of the trading account is reserved in margin capacity that Is not committed. So, again thanks Phil and all of you other members. Newthugger

Phil: I am always able to figure out your trades, including the rational when put in the right context of previous comments, etc. Keep doing what you're doing. It is much appreciated, and invaluable. Your hit rate of successful trades has been very high in my 1.5 months as a member, but even more importantly is your teaching of how to repair and DD positions that haven't gone your way yet. As with most members, we all have our ‘pet' trading interests, and learning how to think about trading is much more important than a specific trade, which could see the conditions behind it change an hour later. This is the classic case, of ‘Teach us to Fish', rather than just giving us a fish once in a while. Thank you! Neverworkagain

Phil, I followed your investing ideas in LTP quite closely. It seems your insightful fundamental analysis knowledge serves you v. well. I get entertained and they are profitable. Investwizard

You may wonder if anyone gets anything out of you seminars (or may not wonder). Anyway, I almost never day trade because of my job. Today, I was home due to the snow and since I was behind by 2 weeks on watching your recorded seminars I though I would watch one of them. I set up my pivot point charts in TOS to match the ones in your seminar and made the QQQ trade from this morning. I only bought 5 puts. While I watched the seminar, I would pause then switch back and forth and watch the live QQQ chart. I ended up stopping out for a $170 gain, but it was pretty cool to have the dip and recovery at the same time I was learning the art of stopping out when a pivot line was taken out. rj_jarboe

Phil/CL-that play made a quick $500 per contract! Took all of 10 minutes! I want to thank you for helping me not just learn a bit about trading, but giving me some confidence and most of all a rewarding ""hobby"" to look forward to each day. I have had a few mistakes and losses along the way, but I have had some great wins too and I am now consistently making money trading futures and have even learned to go to sleep while holding a losing position knowing that tomorrow is always another opportunity to win again. So thanks again for your help and patience along the way. Craigsa620

Tesla et. al. – I've spent many months getting hammered shorting overvalued Momos, until, finally, I internalized Phil's message. Play small; give yourself plenty of room to double/move up the [lack of value] chain in terms of price. Play short; take [Musk's, eg.] latest bleep and sell the spike for a short time frame, because his tweets always come to naught. I've been coining money doing it, I just watch that premium melt away with scarcely veiled amusement. Swinging for the fences is for suckers [me, for a long time]. Those little gains really add up — $2k per week of evaporated premium and you could actually buy a Tesla by the end of the year!! zeroxzero

Thanks, I managed to make 2k today so I am happy…and feel like I am finally getting it. New equipment and a quiet place to work helps a lot. I am happy for all the members that took your /NKD advice….that was fun I am sure! coke Take your vitamins…I don't know how you do all this! but, keep it up! Coke"

1236,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/23/politics/ukraine-donald-trump-joe-biden-impeachment/,2019-09-23T00:00:00,Ukraine drama could give Democrats no choice but to impeach Trump,"(CNN) The Ukraine scandal raging around Donald Trump is forcing Democrats to confront a fateful choice on impeachment that will not just shape the 2020 election but will echo down the ages.

The facts of whether the President pressured Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic general election opponent Joe Biden while a US military aid package was on the table are still obscured.

Trump supporters say there is so far no evidence that he offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and note that an intelligence community whistleblower who raised the alarm was operating with a second-hand knowledge of Trump's conversations.

But if Trump used his power to try to coerce a foreign leader into influencing US elections, it could precipitate the worst political crisis of a presidency that has been mired in notoriety from its first hours.

It would amount to a situation in which Trump's team, which according to the Mueller report expected to benefit from Russian election meddling in 2016, is now using the power of the presidency to incite collusion ahead of the 2020 election.

That possibility seemed to unlock a shift Sunday in the Democratic position on impeachment. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon."" And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who has been loath to contemplate an impeachment drama -- warned that events might necessitate a ""new stage of investigation.""

Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels, told CNN on Monday morning, ""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus.""

Republican senators who have strongly supported Trump were largely silent but Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah tweeted Sunday ""it would be troubling in the extreme"" if Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and that it is ""critical for the facts to come out.""

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. The then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Yury Lutsenko said in May that Burisma Holdings, a major energy company, did not violate Ukrainian law by having Hunter Biden on its board and paying him.

Trump's claims that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he investigated a business for which his son served as a board member have previously been found to be false. The prosecutor was seen as corrupt by multiple governments and international institutions, not just the former vice president.

Why pressure by Trump on Ukrainians would matter

Presidents are expected to act in the interests of all Americans and not to use their vast discretion in foreign policy to pursue political vendettas or subvert US democracy. The Founders saw the presidency as a public trust, meaning that its incumbents should not put their personal interests over the national interest. The Ukraine story is so significant because it may have the potential to fall into such grave constitutional territory and could represent an abuse of presidential power.

Trump and his team seemed at odds Sunday over whether to publish the transcript of his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And they went on offense in typical fashion, bending facts and spinning conspiracy theories, obfuscation and hypocrisy.

Trump insisted that he said ""absolutely nothing wrong"" in the call with the Ukrainian president. ""It was perfect,"" he said. Trump often gives the impression that he believes he is not constrained by norms on the limits of power observed by past presidents. In July for instance, he said, falsely, that Article 2 of the Constitution ""allows me to do whatever I want as President.""

Past scrapes like the 2016 Russian election meddling scandal -- and multiple controversies ranging from his insulting behavior toward the late Sen. John McCain to his payments to women who claimed they had affairs with him -- have failed to bring him down. His emergence from each may have taught him a lesson.

Trump says he spoke to Ukrainian President about Biden

Trump on Sunday appeared to add new context to the Ukraine story when he said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president at a time when Kiev was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States. The call with Zelensky took place on July 25. Congress passed the bill in August and the White House lifted a hold on the money in September.

""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump said.

CNN has reported that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden's son in a call on July 25, but did not discuss a pending aid package at the time, indicating there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined in the conversation.

The latest developments highlighted Pelosi's reluctance to trigger impeachment proceedings against Trump amid fears of a political backlash. But Schiff, a Pelosi ally, suggested things may be about to change.

""This would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort and not first resort,"" Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""But if the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.""

Pelosi and Schiff were in close coordination throughout the weekend talking about the Ukraine whistleblower story and coordinating strategy, a leadership aide confirmed to CNN.

The way that events could force the hands of Democratic leaders became even clearer later on Sunday.

Pelosi hinted at a change of strategy in a message to Democratic colleagues, over half of whom had already backed the idea of impeachment.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi wrote on Sunday.

Democratic reluctance on impeachment

Pelosi has been reluctant to embrace impeachment since Senate Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict the President. There is also no desire to set Trump's political base alight as Democrats try to keep their House majority in 2020.

If Trump's behavior is exposed as corrupt, Democrats may be forced into impeachment hearings -- whatever the long-term political cost.

To do nothing would be to accept that a President can abuse his power by seeking foreign interference in American democracy. Trump would feel validated and emboldened.

The balance between Congress and the Presidency will have been fundamentally altered and there will be few checks and balances left capable of constraining Trump and future presidents.

Inaction might also be politically unsustainable since Democrats might see their own leaders as willing to use the power of a House majority to defend their own presidential front-runner.

Democrats, both freshmen from Trump-won districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations on Monday morning.

That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.

Trump allies hit back

Seeking to fog such questions, Trump's lieutenants went on the offensive on Sunday talk shows using a familiar playbook.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revived debunked questions about Biden's conduct.

""I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,"" Pompeo said on ABC's ""This Week.""

""America cannot have our elections interfered with, and if that's what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know.""

For the administration to make an argument about electoral interference seems somewhat rich, given that Trump has long rejected evidence that Russia intervened in 2016 to help him.

On ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was no reason to believe Trump pressured Ukraine, though admitted he wasn't on the call in question.

And he argued that Biden's son should not have been allowed to do business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Asked by Jake Tapper Sunday about the glaring inconsistency in this statement since Trump's children continue to work globally on a business from which the President has not fully divested, Mnuchin dodged.

""I don't really want to go into more of these details,"" Mnuchin said.

Both Mnuchin and Pompeo opposed releasing transcripts of Trump's calls, arguing that a President has a right to confidentiality in conversations with foreign leaders.

The administration's efforts to stop acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire from releasing the whistleblower report to Congress, and its opposition to releasing a transcript, are only fueling speculation the White House has something to hide. If there was wrongdoing such conduct could equal obstruction of justice, historically an impeachable offense.

Trump, however, said that he hoped they would release the transcript.

Biden, meanwhile, spent the weekend defending himself and trying to turn the scandal to his own advantage in a tight primary race.

""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden said.

China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 1% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 0.8%, its sixth straight day of declines. The index has lost about 4% over that period.

A Chinese trade delegation abruptly canceled a visit on Friday to US farms in Montana, cutting short their US trip, according to Reuters . The trip was to prepare for further negotiations between senior officials next month.

Investors had earlier expected a potential cooling of US-China trade tensions as the two sides gear up for talks. But the sudden change in the trip dampened investor hopes for a breakthrough in the negotiations.

Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump had said the United States was looking for a ""complete deal"" with China and not a partial one.

The IHS Markit PMI reading for Germany's manufacturing sector slumped to 41.4 points in September, the lowest in more than a decade and 2.1 points south of last month's already-gloomy assessment, as job creation stalled and the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions and the impending exit of Britain from the European Union hammered order books.

The overall IHS Markit Composite reading for Germany fell to 49.1 points, the lowest in seven years and well below the 50 point mark that generally signals economic growth. The IHS reading for the broader Eurozone was also softer-than-expected, with a composite tally of 50.4 points and a manufacturing assessment of just 46 points, the lowest since 2012.

""The economy is limping towards the final quarter of the year and, on its current trajectory, might not see any growth before the end of 2019,"" IHS economist Phil Smith said. ""The manufacturing numbers are simply awful. All the uncertainty around trade wars, the outlook for the car industry and Brexit are paralyzing order books, with September seeing the worst performance from the sector since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.""

European stocks fell to a session low following the German data release of 390.61 points, while the single currency slumped to 1.0972 against the U.S. dollar as investors bet that the recession signals could elicit a deeper monetary support from the European Central Bank, which said earlier this month it would re-start its controversial bond buying program in order to kick-start growth.

Benchmark 10-year German bund yields, a proxy for risk-free borrowing rates in the region, fell 3 basis point to -0.55%.

Germany's economy shrank 0.1% over the three months ending in June, the Federal Statistics Office said last month, and industrial orders and manufacturing output rates have been falling for much of the summer as the U.S.-China trade spat accelerated and Brussels continued to negotiate a nascent trade deal with Washington.

""With job creation across Germany stalling, the domestic-oriented service sector has lost one of its main pillars of growth,"" said Smith. ""A first fall in services new business for over four-and-a-half years provides evidence that demand across Germany is already starting to deteriorate."""

After logging five straight weeks of gains, euro zone stocks .STOXXE slipped 1% as surveys showed growth in services and manufacturing in the region stalled in September. As a result, bets on rate cuts accelerated in euro zone money markets.

Germany's DAX index .GDAXI fell 1% to post its biggest one-day fall since Aug 23 as the latest purchasing managers numbers showed its manufacturing sector sinking deeper into recession.

“If nothing else, the readings... all but guarantee that ECB stimulus efforts will expand and be sustained,” said Ken Odeluga, a market analyst at City Index. “How effective they may be is another question entirely.”

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said the data justified the bank’s indefinite stimulus promised earlier this month and reiterated his call on governments to step up their efforts as monetary policy can only prop up domestic confidence.

Banks were the worst hit, with the eurozone banking index .SX7E slumping 2.8. This included a 7.5% slump in Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) after Moody’s said the German bank’s restructuring plan is negative for its credit rating.

The broader pan-European index that includes stocks outside the euro zone slipped 0.8%, breaking three sessions of gains.

Persistent concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions were also a reason for investors to jettison stocks and move to the safety of bonds. Market participants are still unconvinced that a trade deal between the two countries is likely anytime soon.

U.S. and Chinese officials described the deputy-level trade talks last week as being “constructive” and “productive”, but this came after a Chinese agriculture delegation canceled a visit to U.S. farms in Montana on Friday.

“What we’d like to see is concrete progress and that is the thing we’re lacking,” said IG Markets analyst Chris Beauchamp.

Trade-reliant sectors such as mining .SXPP, auto and parts .SXAP and technology .SX8P were among the biggest decliners, losing at least 1.7% each.

Shares of TUI (TUIT.L) jumped 7.2 to top the STOXX 600 and EasyJet (EZJ.L) followed on expectations their businesses will benefit from the collapse of British rival Thomas Cook (TCG.L).

These moves, along with a drop in the pound GBP=, helped limit losses on London's FTSE 100 .FTSE to 0.3%."

Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Citigroup (C.N) and Barclays (BARC.L) were among 130 banks to join the new framework on the eve of a United Nations summit in New York aimed at pushing companies and governments to act quickly to avert catastrophic global warming.

“These principles mean banks have to consider the impact of their loans on society – not just on their portfolio,” Simone Dettling, banking team lead for the Geneva-based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative, told Reuters.

Under pressure from investors, regulators and climate activists, some big banks have acknowledged the role lenders will need to play in a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy.

Financing for oil, gas and coal projects has come under particular scrutiny as climate scientists step up calls to change the global economy’s deep reliance on fossil-fuels to avert disastrous warming.

The principles, drawn up jointly by U.N. officials and banks, require lenders to:

- Align their strategies with the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming and U.N.-backed targets to fight poverty called the Sustainable Development Goals

- Set targets to increase “positive impacts” and reduce “negative impacts” on people and the environment

- Work with clients and customers to encourage sustainable practices

- Be transparent and accountable about their progress.

The principles’ main backers say the norms will encourage banks to pivot their loan portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets and redirect capital to greener industries.

Critics argue that banks should go much further by explicitly committing to phasing out financing for fossil fuel projects and agribusiness that drive deforestation in the Amazon, Southeast Asia and other regions.

However, the new standards could also force participating banks to choose between foregoing business from clients in high-carbon sectors and the risk of being accused of backsliding on the principles if they continue to finance such firms.

Although the initiative is voluntary, Dettling, who played a central role during 18 months of negotiations with a core group of 30 founding banks, said lenders would be reluctant to accept the reputational risk of losing their signatory status.

“They need to demonstrate that they are making progress — and progress within a given timeline,” Dettling said.

“Ultimately, banks that are not in line with their commitments and do not make progress can be stripped of their signatory status,” she said.

Banks in Europe, in particular, also face growing regulatory pressure to disclose their exposure to the potential impact of climate-related disasters and a low-carbon energy transition on their asset base.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has joined counterparts in France and the Netherlands to push for better supervision of climate risk, was due to address the U.N. climate summit on Monday, according to a draft agenda.

Other banks to join the “Principles for Responsible Banking” initiative included Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO), ABN Amro (ABNd.AS), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), according to a statement."
1241,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-09-21/column-trumps-disdain-for-alliances-backfires,2019-09-21T00:00:00,Column: Trump’s disdain for alliances backfires,"A strange thing happened when the Trump administration tried to recruit an international coalition of naval forces to protect oil tankers in the Persian Gulf this summer: Nobody wanted to sign up.

Almost nobody, anyway. Britain, usually America’sclosest ally, said no — but then acquired a new prime minister, Boris Johnson, who said yes. Bahrain joined; the Arab kingdom is the landlord to the U.S. Navy headquarters in the gulf. Australia agreed to send an airplane and a frigate.

And that, until recently, was the entire coalition: four countries, only two of which contributed substantial forces. Even Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, whose oil was being protected, didn’t join up until last week.

Recruiting old allies to help protect the tankers that carry oil to help power the world’s economy shouldn’t have been so hard. But when a president denounces the idea of alliances, slams traditional allies as deadbeats, and changes direction without warning, even old friends hesitate to jump on his team.

“President Trump has made it far more difficult to build coalitions and get people on our side when we need them,” Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told me. “When you lose other countries’ confidence, restoring it is hard.”

Until recently, Trump’s “America first” disdain for international alliances was mostly a theoretical problem, a source of anguish to foreign policy traditionalists, but little more.

Now it’s a practical challenge too. The president will speak Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, hoping to help organize a collective response to Iran’s recent aggression, including its suspected role in last week’s startling missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia’s largest oil processing facility and a nearby oil field, sending global energy markets into a swoon.

But no other major nation appeared eagerto join in a U.S.-led effort, whether it involves military action, economic sanctions or even mere diplomacy.

Britain, France and Germany echoed the United States in condemning the drone and missile attack, but that part was easy. Unlike the White House, they didn’t point the finger at Iran.

And when Trump ordered new sanctions against Iran’s Central Bank on Friday, no other country joined in. The president acted alone.

Trump’s failure to build coalitions isn’t surprising. He has long described alliances as unnecessary entanglements that impose costs on the United States but offer few benefits.

In 1987, he derided President Reagan’s use of naval power to protect shipping in the Persian Gulf. “The world is laughing at America’s politicians as we protect ships we don’t own, carrying oil we don’t need, destined for allies who won’t help,” he said.

Last year, on a visit to Europe, he repeated his long-held suspicion of NATO, the military alliance that kept peace in Europe for more than half a century: “It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves,” he said.

Add the many complaints from other world leaders about Trump’s undiplomatic style — his exaggerations and lies, his unreliability, his refusal to consider the interests of anyone but himself — and you have a list of reasons they don’t view him as a trustworthy teammate, much less as team captain.

“Alliances are built on two things: mutual interests and mutual confidence,” Daalder said. “Trump doesn’t seem to get that.”

All this was predictable, and predicted, after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that had been painstakingly negotiated by his predecessor, President Obama. Trump insisted he would force Iran back to negotiations through stiffer sanctions and made a stronger deal.

None of the five other world powers that had signed the accord agreed. They argued that the deal, flawed though it might be, was keeping Iran’s nuclear ambitions in check.

Britain, France and Germany had asked for time to seek changes that might induce Trump to stay in the agreement, and the president initially agreed. But in May 2018, as the Europeans believed they were close to a deal with Iran, Trump abruptly pulled out. The British ambassador in Washington, Kim Darroch, called it an act of “diplomatic vandalism.”

Then, when the White House launched a “maximum pressure” campaign with the avowed aim of crippling Iran’s economy, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo urged world powers to join in. The other signatories all refused and sought instead to keep the nuclear deal alive.

In June, after at least four foreign-flagged tankers were sabotaged in the gulf, Pompeo tried to build a maritime coalition, saying he hoped to recruit at least 20 countries. Then Trump weighed in.

“All of these countries should be protecting their own ships,” the president tweeted. “We don’t even need to be there.”

Since the attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure, however, White House aides say the president wants to marshal a joint international response. The allies are skeptical. France and Germany said the best solution was for the United States to return to the 2015 nuclear agreement and for Iran, which has violated some of its provisions in recent months, to do the same.

It’s especially piquant that Trump will use the U.N. as his platform to seek action against Iran. In his 2016 campaign, he dismissed the global organization as rife with “utter weakness and incompetence.”

Last week, he sounded a different note. “I’ve always felt the United Nations is very important,” he said.

Now, in a crisis that is partly of his own making, he sounds as if he could use an ally or two. He’ll look for some at the U.N. this week — and wonder, perhaps, why he finds so few."

The Gluskin Sheff chief economist and strategist predicts economic growth in the U.S. will turn negative sooner than most investors anticipate — setting the stage for a painful market pullback.

""There's a recession coming in the next 12 months,"" he said last Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now.

The Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate last Wednesday by a quarter point. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled rates would only be cut again if there's new evidence the economy is softening. However, Powell said he didn't expect that to happen.

""The only reason that he said that he's optimistic on the outlook is because of exactly what the Fed is doing which is breathing stimulus back into the economy,"" said Rosenberg, who came into 2019 with a recession warning and has been known as a perma-bear on Wall Street for decades.

Yet, U.S. growth hasn't gone negative this year. Plus, the S&P 500 and Dow are up more than 19% and 15%, respectively.

But according to Rosenberg, it's just a matter of time until economic data sours and Powell is forced to resume easing in the coming months.

""I think that they'll go in October and December and through 2020,"" he added.

Whether the Fed cuts all the way to zero or not, Rosenberg speculates the outcome will be the same: Recession.

""The economy is already slowing down,"" Rosenberg said. ""Earnings are actually contracting.""

So it's the same old, same old but, fortunately, we don't care because we CASHED OUT almost all of our positions last week and now we've got ringside seats for Q4, which starts in a week – it's going to be FUN!

It's not that we're particularly short on the markets – we aren't making many short bets – it's just that we've lost faith in the bullish premise and we do expect a correction but, the way the Fed and the Trump Adminstration rush in to prop up every dip in the markets – we're certainly not ready to make a bear case.

The same cannot be said for our friend David Rosenberg, who expects a PAINFUL pullback in the next 12 months EVEN if the Fed were to cut rates to ZERO. “The economy is already slowing down,” Rosenberg said. “Earnings are actually contracting.” Well Duh!, Dave – we've been talking about that for ages. The question is – will it MATTER? Back in 2007, I used to call it the ""It Just Doesn't Matter"" rally as the market just seemed to ignore any bad news and go higher and higher – no matter what was thrown at it until, suddenly, in the fall of 2008 – EVERYTHING started to matter and all the good news in the World wasn't going to help.

Double Line's Jeff Gundlach says the odds of a Recession are certainly rising and that the consumers are starting to concern him as they begin to have doubts that America will be great again and curtail their spending, something that is already in evidence as Savings Rates are up 8.2% this year – that's not something Consumers tend to do when they feel confident about the future.

Will any of this stuff matter in Q4, well the reason we opted not to risk our very strong annual gains into the last quarter is earnings are in serious decline and Q3 actual earnings and Q4 guidance will give us something close to year-end totals and, if they turn out to be disappointing overall – then how do you continue to justify record-high market prices? We don't know whan things are going to turn – just that they will – so better safe than sorry.

We'll see our own PMI report at 9:45 this morning and then we have 3 Fed speakers to start the week off with a good spin. The Chicago Fed was a bit better than expected this morning but +0.10 is something to rave about but better than last month's -0.41. Tomorrow we get the Richmond Fed Report as well as Consumer Confidence and some housing date. Wednesday we are graced with 3 more Fed speaders and more housing data but Thursday is amazing with 5 Fed speakers, GDP, Corporate Profits, the KC Fed, Business Inventories AND a 7-year note auction. Friday is still interesting with 2 more Fed speakers, Durable Goods, Personal Income, Consumer Sentiment and Farm Prices – what a week!

That's 13 Fed speakers in 5 days (3 are Thursday afternoon) so we should be good and confused as the month comes to a close. Even if people do want to sell off – we have end-of-quarter window-dressing into Friday and we ended June at 2,945 so closing Q3 on a positive note will give all those Fund Managers and Financial Advisers something to brag about as they ask you to trust them in Q4 (which did not work out well last year AT ALL) so you can expect our friendly Banksters to pull out all the stops to keep us as close to 3,000 on the S&P as they can.

We're still getting quite a few major earnings reports though now it's more the early reporters for Q3 than the late ones for Q2 – either way, we love the data and we're not totally against picking up bargains if we get silly sell-offs – we're just not likely to make any major commitments until we see a proper correction in the broader market.

1245,,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/,2019-06-18T00:00:00,Facebook announces Libra cryptocurrency: All you need to know – TechCrunch,"Facebook has finally revealed the details of its cryptocurrency, Libra, which will let you buy things or send money to people with nearly zero fees. You’ll pseudonymously buy or cash out your Libra online or at local exchange points like grocery stores, and spend it using interoperable third-party wallet apps or Facebook’s own Calibra wallet that will be built into WhatsApp, Messenger and its own app. Today Facebook released its white paper explaining Libra and its testnet for working out the kinks of its blockchain system before a public launch in the first half of 2020.

Facebook won’t fully control Libra, but instead get just a single vote in its governance like other founding members of the Libra Association, including Visa, Uber and Andreessen Horowitz, which have invested at least $10 million each into the project’s operations. The association will promote the open-sourced Libra Blockchain and developer platform with its own Move programming language, plus sign up businesses to accept Libra for payment and even give customers discounts or rewards.

Facebook is launching a subsidiary company also called Calibra that handles its crypto dealings and protects users’ privacy by never mingling your Libra payments with your Facebook data so it can’t be used for ad targeting. Your real identity won’t be tied to your publicly visible transactions. But Facebook/Calibra and other founding members of the Libra Association will earn interest on the money users cash in that is held in reserve to keep the value of Libra stable.

Facebook’s audacious bid to create a global digital currency that promotes financial inclusion for the unbanked actually has more privacy and decentralization built in than many expected. Instead of trying to dominate Libra’s future or squeeze tons of cash out of it immediately, Facebook is instead playing the long-game by pulling payments into its online domain. Facebook’s VP of blockchain, David Marcus, explained the company’s motive and the tie-in with its core revenue source during a briefing at San Francisco’s historic Mint building. “If more commerce happens, then more small businesses will sell more on and off platform, and they’ll want to buy more ads on the platform so it will be good for our ads business.”

The risk and reward of building the new PayPal

In cryptocurrencies, Facebook saw both a threat and an opportunity. They held the promise of disrupting how things are bought and sold by eliminating transaction fees common with credit cards. That comes dangerously close to Facebook’s ad business that influences what is bought and sold. If a competitor like Google or an upstart built a popular coin and could monitor the transactions, they’d learn what people buy and could muscle in on the billions spent on Facebook marketing. Meanwhile, the 1.7 billion people who lack a bank account might choose whoever offers them a financial services alternative as their online identity provider too. That’s another thing Facebook wants to be.

Yet existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum weren’t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange. Their unanchored price was susceptible to huge and unpredictable swings, making it tough for merchants to accept as payment. And cryptocurrencies miss out on much of their potential beyond speculation unless there are enough places that will take them instead of dollars, and the experience of buying and spending them is easy enough for a mainstream audience. But with Facebook’s relationship with 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses plus its user experience prowess, it was well-poised to tackle this juggernaut of a problem.

Now Facebook wants to make Libra the evolution of PayPal . It’s hoping Libra will become simpler to set up, more ubiquitous as a payment method, more efficient with fewer fees, more accessible to the unbanked, more flexible thanks to developers and more long-lasting through decentralization.

“Success will mean that a person working abroad has a fast and simple way to send money to family back home, and a college student can pay their rent as easily as they can buy a coffee,” Facebook writes in its Libra documentation. That would be a big improvement on today, when you’re stuck paying rent in insecure checks while exploitative remittance services charge an average of 7% to send money abroad, taking $50 billion from users annually. Libra could also power tiny microtransactions worth just a few cents that are infeasible with credit card fees attached, or replace your pre-paid transit pass.

…Or it could be globally ignored by consumers who see it as too much hassle for too little reward, or too unfamiliar and limited in use to pull them into the modern financial landscape. Facebook has built a reputation for over-engineered, underused products. It will need all the help it can get if wants to replace what’s already in our pockets.

Here’s our zero-buzzword breakdown of Libra:

How does Libra work?

By now you know the basics of Libra. Cash in a local currency, get Libra, spend them like dollars without big transaction fees or your real name attached, cash them out whenever you want. Feel free to stop reading and share this article if that’s all you care about. But the underlying technology, the association that governs it, the wallets you’ll use and the way payments work all have a huge amount of fascinating detail to them. Facebook has released more than 100 pages of documentation on Libra and Calibra, and we’ve pulled out the most important facts. Let’s dive in.

The Libra Association — crypto’s new oligarchy

Facebook knew people wouldn’t trust it to wholly steer the cryptocurrency they use, and it also wanted help to spur adoption. So the social network recruited the founding members of the Libra Association, a not-for-profit which oversees the development of the token, the reserve of real-world assets that gives it value and the governance rules of the blockchain. “If we were controlling it, very few people would want to jump on and make it theirs,” says Marcus.

Each founding member paid a minimum of $10 million to join and optionally become a validator node operator (more on that later), gain one vote in the Libra Association council and be entitled to a share (proportionate to their investment) of the dividends from interest earned on the Libra reserve into which users pay fiat currency to receive Libra.

The 28 soon-to-be founding members of the association and their industries, previously reported by The Block’s Frank Chaparro, include:

Payments: Mastercard, PayPal, PayU (Naspers’ fintech arm), Stripe, Visa

Technology and marketplaces: Booking Holdings, eBay, Facebook/Calibra, Farfetch, Lyft, Mercado Pago, Spotify AB, Uber Technologies, Inc.

Telecommunications: Iliad, Vodafone Group

Blockchain: Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Inc., Xapo Holdings Limited

Venture Capital: Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Union Square Ventures

Nonprofit and multilateral organizations, and academic institutions: Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women’s World Banking

Facebook says it hopes to reach 100 founding members before the official Libra launch and it’s open to anyone that meets the requirements, including direct competitors like Google or Twitter. The Libra Association is based in Geneva, Switzerland and will meet biannually. The country was chosen for its neutral status and strong support for financial innovation including blockchain technology.

Libra governance — who gets a vote

To join the association, members must have a half rack of server space, a 100Mbps or above dedicated internet connection, a full-time site reliability engineer and enterprise-grade security. Businesses must hit two of three thresholds of a $1 billion USD market value or $500 million in customer balances, reach 20 million people a year and/or be recognized as a top 100 industry leader by a group like Interbrand Global or the S&P.

Crypto-focused investors must have more than $1 billion in assets under management, while Blockchain businesses must have been in business for a year, have enterprise-grade security and privacy and custody or staking greater than $100 million in assets. And only up to one-third of founding members can by crypto-related businesses or individually invited exceptions. Facebook also accepts research organizations like universities, and nonprofits fulfilling three of four qualities, including working on financial inclusion for more than five years, multi-national reach to lots of users, a top 100 designation by Charity Navigator or something like it and/or $50 million in budget.

The Libra Association will be responsible for recruiting more founding members to act as validator nodes for the blockchain, fundraising to jump-start the ecosystem, designing incentive programs to reward early adopters and doling out social impact grants. A council with a representative from each member will help choose the association’s managing director, who will appoint an executive team and elect a board of five to 19 top representatives.

Each member, including Facebook/Calibra, will only get up to one vote or 1% of the total vote (whichever is larger) in the Libra Association council. This provides a level of decentralization that protects against Facebook or any other player hijacking Libra for its own gain. By avoiding sole ownership and dominion over Libra, Facebook could avoid extra scrutiny from regulators who are already investigating it for a sea of privacy abuses as well as potentially anti-competitive behavior. In an attempt to preempt criticism from lawmakers, the Libra Association writes, “We welcome public inquiry and accountability. We are committed to a dialogue with regulators and policymakers. We share policymakers’ interest in the ongoing stability of national currencies.”

The Libra currency — a stablecoin

A Libra is a unit of the Libra cryptocurrency that’s represented by a three wavy horizontal line unicode character ≋ like the dollar is represented by $. The value of a Libra is meant to stay largely stable, so it’s a good medium of exchange, as merchants can be confident they won’t be paid a Libra today that’s then worth less tomorrow. The Libra’s value is tied to a basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities for a slew of historically stable international currencies, including the dollar, pound, euro, Swiss franc and yen. The Libra Association maintains this basket of assets and can change the balance of its composition if necessary to offset major price fluctuations in any one foreign currency so that the value of a Libra stays consistent.

The name Libra comes from the word for a Roman unit of weight measure. It’s trying to invoke a sense of financial freedom by playing on the French stem “Lib,” meaning free.

The Libra Association is still hammering out the exact start value for the Libra, but it’s meant to be somewhere close to the value of a dollar, euro or pound so it’s easy to conceptualize. That way, a gallon of milk in the U.S. might cost 3 to 4 Libra, similar but not exactly the same as with dollars.

The idea is that you’ll cash in some money and keep a balance of Libra that you can spend at accepting merchants and online services. You’ll be able to trade in your local currency for Libra and vice versa through certain wallet apps, including Facebook’s Calibra, third-party wallet apps and local resellers like convenience or grocery stores where people already go to top-up their mobile data plan.

The Libra Reserve — one for one

Each time someone cashes in a dollar or their respective local currency, that money goes into the Libra Reserve and an equivalent value of Libra is minted and doled out to that person. If someone cashes out from the Libra Association, the Libra they give back are destroyed/burned and they receive the equivalent value in their local currency back. That means there’s always 100% of the value of the Libra in circulation, collateralized with real-world assets in the Libra Reserve. It never runs fractional. And unliked “pegged” stable coins that are tied to a single currency like the USD, Libra maintains its own value — though that should cash out to roughly the same amount of a given currency over time.

When Libra Association members join and pay their $10 million minimum, they receive Libra Investment Tokens. Their share of the total tokens translates into the proportion of the dividend they earn off of interest on assets in the reserve. Those dividends are only paid out after Libra Association uses interest to pay for operating expenses, investments in the ecosystem, engineering research and grants to nonprofits and other organizations. This interest is part of what attracted the Libra Association’s members. If Libra becomes popular and many people carry a large balance of the currency, the reserve will grow huge and earn significant interest.

The Libra Blockchain — built for speed

Every Libra payment is permanently written into the Libra Blockchain — a cryptographically authenticated database that acts as a public online ledger designed to handle 1,000 transactions per second. That would be much faster than Bitcoin’s 7 transactions per second or Ethereum’s 15. The blockchain is operated and constantly verified by founding members of the Libra Association, which each invested $10 million or more for a say in the cryptocurrency’s governance and the ability to operate a validator node.

When a transaction is submitted, each of the nodes runs a calculation based on the existing ledger of all transactions. Thanks to a Byzantine Fault Tolerance system, just two-thirds of the nodes must come to consensus that the transaction is legitimate for it to be executed and written to the blockchain. A structure of Merkle Trees in the code makes it simple to recognize changes made to the Libra Blockchain. With 5KB transactions, 1,000 verifications per second on commodity CPUs and up to 4 billion accounts, the Libra Blockchain should be able to operate at 1,000 transactions per second if nodes use at least 40Mbps connections and 16TB SSD hard drives.

Transactions on Libra cannot be reversed. If an attack compromises over one-third of the validator nodes causing a fork in the blockchain, the Libra Association says it will temporarily halt transactions, figure out the extent of the damage and recommend software updates to resolve the fork.

Transactions aren’t entirely free. They incur a tiny fraction of a cent fee to pay for “gas” that covers the cost of processing the transfer of funds similar to with Ethereum. This fee will be negligible to most consumers, but when they add up, the gas charges will deter bad actors from creating millions of transactions to power spam and denial-of-service attacks. “We’ve purposely tried not to innovate massively on the blockchain itself because we want it to be scalable and secure,” says Marcus of piggybacking on the best elements of existing cryptocurrencies.

Currently, the Libra Blockchain is what’s known as “permissioned,” where only entities that fulfill certain requirements are admitted to a special in-group that defines consensus and controls governance of the blockchain. The problem is this structure is more vulnerable to attacks and censorship because it’s not truly decentralized. But during Facebook’s research, it couldn’t find a reliable permissionless structure that could securely scale to the number of transactions Libra will need to handle. Adding more nodes slows things down, and no one has proven a way to avoid that without compromising security.

That’s why the Libra Association’s goal is to move to a permissionless system based on proof-of-stake that will protect against attacks by distributing control, encourage competition and lower the barrier to entry. It wants to have at least 20% of votes in the Libra Association council coming from node operators based on their total Libra holdings instead of their status as a founding member. That plan should help appease blockchain purists who won’t be satisfied until Libra is completely decentralized.

Move coding language — for moving Libra

The Libra Blockchain is open source with an Apache 2.0 license, and any developer can build apps that work with it using the Move coding language. The blockchain’s prototype launches its testnet today, so it’s effectively in developer beta mode until it officially launches in the first half of 2020. The Libra Association is working with HackerOne to launch a bug bounty system later this year that will pay security researchers for safely identifying flaws and glitches. In the meantime, the Libra Association is implementing the Libra Core using the Rust programming language because it’s designed to prevent security vulnerabilities, and the Move language isn’t fully ready yet.

Move was created to make it easier to write blockchain code that follows an author’s intent without introducing bugs. It’s called Move because its primary function is to move Libra coins from one account to another, and never let those assets be accidentally duplicated. The core transaction code looks like: LibraAccount.pay_from_sender(recipient_address, amount) procedure.

Eventually, Move developers will be able to create smart contracts for programmatic interactions with the Libra Blockchain. Until Move is ready, developers can create modules and transaction scripts for Libra using Move IR, which is high-level enough to be human-readable but low-level enough to be translatable into real Move bytecode that’s written to the blockchain.

The Libra ecosystem and the Move language will be completely open to use and build, which presents a sizable risk. Crooked developers could prey on crypto novices, claiming their app works just the same as legitimate ones, and that it’s safe because it uses Libra. But if consumers get ripped off by these scammers, the anger will surely bubble up to Facebook. Yet still, Calibra’s head of product tells me, “There are no plans for the Libra Association to take a role in actively vetting [developers],” Calibra’s head of product Kevin Weil tells me.

Even though it’s tried to distance itself sufficiently via its subsidiary Libra and the association, many people will probably always think of Libra as Facebook’s cryptocurrency and blame it for their woes.

Libra incentives — rewarding early businesses

The Libra Association wants to encourage more developers and merchants to work with its cryptocurrency. That’s why it plans to issue incentives, possibly Libra coins, to validator node operators who can get people signed up for and using Libra. Wallets that pull users through the Know Your Customer anti-fraud and money laundering process or that keep users sufficiently active for over a year will be rewarded. For each transaction they process, merchants will also receive a percentage of the transaction back.

Businesses that earn these incentives can keep them, or pass some or all of them along to users in the form of free Libra tokens or discounts on their purchases. This could create competition between wallets to see which can pass on the most rewards to their customers, and thereby attract the most users. You could imagine eBay or Spotify giving you a discount for paying in Libra, while wallet developers might offer you free tokens if you complete 100 transactions within a year.

“One challenge for Spotify and its users around the world has been the lack of easily accessible payment systems – especially for those in financially underserved markets,” Spotify’s Chief Premium Business Officer Alex Norström writes. “In joining the Libra Association, there is an opportunity to better reach Spotify’s total addressable market, eliminate friction and enable payments in mass scale.”

This savvy incentive system should massively help ratchet up Libra’s user count without dictating how businesses balance their margins versus growth. Facebook also has another plan to grow its developer ecosystem. By offering venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures a portion of the reserve interest, they’re motivating to fund startups building Libra infrastructure.

Using Libra

So how do you actually own and spend Libra? Through Libra wallets like Facebook’s own Calibra and others that will be built by third-parties, potentially including Libra Association members like PayPal. The idea is to make sending money to a friend or paying for something as easy as sending a Facebook Message. You won’t be able to make or receive any real payments until the official launch next year, though, but you can sign up for early access when it’s ready here.

None of the Libra Association members agreed to provide details on what exactly they’ll build on the blockchain, but we can take Facebook’s Calibra wallet as an example of the basic experience. Calibra will launch alongside the Libra currency on iOS and Android within Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and a standalone app. When users first sign up, they’ll be taken through a Know Your Customer anti-fraud process where they’ll have to provide a government-issued photo ID and other verification info. They’ll need to conduct due diligence on customers and report suspicious activity to the authorities.

From there you’ll be able to cash in to Libra, pick a friend or merchant, set an amount to send them and add a description and send them Libra. You’ll also be able to request Libra, and Calibra will offer an expedited way of paying merchants by scanning your or their QR code. Eventually it wants to offer in-store payments and integrations with point-of-sale systems like Square.

The Libra Association’s e-commerce members seem particularly excited about how the token could eliminate transaction fees and speed up checkout. “We believe blockchain will benefit the luxury industry by improving IP protection, transparency in the product life cycle and — as in the case of Libra — enable global frictionless e-commerce,” says FarFetch CEO Jose Neves.

Privacy — at least from Facebook

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained some of the philosophy behind Libra and Calibra in a post today. “It’s decentralized — meaning it’s run by many different organizations instead of just one, making the system fairer overall. It’s available to anyone with an internet connection and has low fees and costs. And it’s secured by cryptography which helps keep your money safe. This is an important part of our vision for a privacy-focused social platform — where you can interact in all the ways you’d want privately, from messaging to secure payments.”

By default, Facebook won’t import your contacts or any of your profile information, but may ask if you wish to do so. It also won’t share any of your transaction data back to Facebook, so it won’t be used to target you with ads, rank your News Feed, or otherwise earn Facebook money directly. Data will only be shared in specific instances in anonymized ways for research or adoption measurement, for hunting down fraudsters or due to a request from law enforcement. And you don’t even need a Facebook or WhatsApp account to sign up for Calibra or to use Libra.

“We realize people don’t want their social data and financial data commingled,” says Marcus, who’s now head of Calibra. “The reality is we’ll have plenty of wallets that will compete with us and many of them will not be in social, and if we want to successfully win people’s trust, we have to make sure the data will be separated.”

In case you are hacked, scammed or lose access to your account, Calibra will refund you for lost coins when possible through 24/7 chat support because it’s a custodial wallet. You also won’t have to remember any long, complex crypto passwords you could forget and get locked out from your money, as Calibra manages all your keys for you. Given Calibra will likely become the default wallet for many Libra users, this extra protection and smoother user experience is essential.

For now, Calibra won’t make money. But Calibra’s head of product Kevin Weil tells me that if it reaches scale, Facebook could launch other financial tools through Calibra that it could monetize, such as investing or lending. “In time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass,” the Calibra team writes. That makes it start to sound a lot like China’s everything app WeChat.

A global coin

Facebook got one thing right for sure: Today’s money doesn’t work for everyone. Those of us living comfortably in developed nations likely don’t see the hardships that befall migrant workers or the unbanked abroad. Preyed on by greedy payday lenders and high-fee remittance services, targeted by muggers and left out of traditional financial services, the poor get poorer. Libra has the potential to get more money from working parents back to their families and help people retain credit even if they’re robbed of their physical possessions. That would do more to accomplish Facebook’s mission of making the world feel smaller than all the News Feed Likes combined.

If Facebook succeeds and legions of people cash in money for Libra, it and the other founding members of the Libra Association could earn big dividends on the interest. And if suddenly it becomes super quick to buy things through Facebook using Libra, businesses will boost their ad spend there. But if Libra gets hacked or proves unreliable, it could cost lots of people around the world money while souring them on cryptocurrencies. And by offering an open Libra platform, shady developers could build apps that snatch not just people’s personal info like Cambridge Analytica, but their hard-earned digital cash.

Facebook just tried to reinvent money. Next year, we’ll see if the Libra Association can pull it off. It took me 4,000 words to explain Libra, but at least now you can make up your own mind about whether to be scared of Facebook crypto."

What to Expect Next,"I have been warning for months that the Fed would need new QE to counter the impact of massive waves of Treasury supply. I thought that that would come later, rather than sooner. Sorry folks, wrong about that. The NY Fed announced another round of new TOMO (Temporary Open Market Operations) today.

In addition to the $75 billion in overnight repos that the Fed issued and has been rolling over since Tuesday, next week the Fed will issue another $90 billion. They’ll come in the form of three $30 billion, 14 day repos to be offered next week.

That brings the new Fed QE to a total of $165 billion. Even in the worst days of the financial crisis, I can’t remember the Fed ballooning its balance sheet by $165 billion in less than 2 weeks. Things must really be bad out there. Much worse than we can imagine.

But is it bearish? Typically, massive money printing can only mean one thing for asset prices. Up, up and away.

Fed De Facto New QE Announcement

Here’s the NY Fed announcement covering this New Fed QE.

In accordance with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directive issued September 18, 2019, the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will conduct a series of overnight and term repurchase agreement (repo) operations to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range. The Desk will offer three 14-day term repo operations for an aggregate amount of at least $30 billion each, as indicated in the schedule below. The Desk also will offer daily overnight repo operations for an aggregate amount of at least $75 billion each, until Thursday, October 10, 2019. Awarded amounts may be less than the amount offered, depending on the total quantity of eligible propositions submitted. Securities eligible as collateral include Treasury, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. Additional details about the operations will be released each afternoon for the following day’s operation(s). Here’s Where the NY Fed Tells Us that New QE is Permanent After October 10, 2019, the Desk will conduct operations as necessary to help maintain the federal funds rate in the target range, the amounts and timing of which have not yet been determined. Schedule of Overnight and Term Repurchase Agreement Operations OPERATION DATE OVERNIGHT 14-DAY TERM TERM MATURITY DATE Monday, 9/23/2019 $75 billion No term operation Tuesday, 9/24/2019 At least $75 billion At least $30 billion Tuesday, 10/08/2019 Wednesday, 9/25/2019 At least $75 billion No term operation Thursday, 9/26/2019 At least $75 billion At least $30 billion Thursday, 10/10/2019 Friday, 9/27/2019 At least $75 billion At least $30 billion Friday, 10/11/2019 Monday, 9/30/2019 – Thursday, 10/10/2019 At least $75 billion No term operations For Monday, September 23, 2019, the Desk will conduct an overnight repo operation for an aggregate amount of up to $75 billion. The operation will be conducted from 8:15 AM ET to 8:30 AM ET. Primary Dealers will be permitted to submit up to two propositions per security type. There will be a limit of $10 billion per proposition submitted in this operation. Propositions will be awarded based on their attractiveness relative to a benchmark rate for each collateral type, and are subject to a minimum bid rate of 1.80 percent.

Here’s Why New Fed QE Will be Permanent

Now, you may be wondering why I’m calling this QE when they are, by name, “Temporary.”

No doubt the Temporary will become Permanent. Because it is just a matter of time before the Fed replaces these “Temporary” operations with POMO (Permanent Open Market Operations). POMO is a fancy way of saying that the Fed will purchase Treasuries directly from Primary Dealers. That’s old QE, and yes, it will, like the horror movie Zombies, will come back from the grave.

Meanwhile, these massive, unprecedentedly (is that a word?) YOOGE repo operations will go on and on. If the Fed wants to keep interest rates low, it will have no choice. It must finance the market’s ability to absorb wave after wave of new Treasury supply as far as the eye can see.

So, will the New QE have the same impact on inflating financial asset bubbles? Or is this time different. It could be! It’s a horror story whose final climax and denouement have yet to be known. But you can be the first to know, as this horror show unfolds. Stay tuned to Liquidity Trader for that story.

1247,,https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-big-pharma-takeover-of-medical-cannabis/,2019-08-12T09:52:11+00:00,Infographic: The Big Pharma Takeover of Medical Cannabis,"The Big Pharma Takeover of Medical Cannabis

As evidence of cannabis’ many benefits mounts, so does the interest from the global pharmaceutical industry, known as Big Pharma. The entrance of such behemoths will radically transform the cannabis industry—once heavily stigmatized, it is now a potentially game-changing source of growth for countless companies.

Today’s infographic comes to us from CB2 Insights, and explores how and why the notorious Big Pharma are interested in the nascent cannabis industry.

Who are “Big Pharma”?

The term refers to some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, considered especially influential as a group. To give a sense of their sheer size, the market cap of the top 10 Big Pharma companies is $1.7 trillion—Johnson & Johnson being the largest, with a market capitalization of $374 billion.

So far, Big Pharma has watched the cannabis industry from the sidelines, deterred by regulatory concerns. What we are seeing now is the sleeping giant’s takeover slowly intensifying as more patents, partnerships, and sponsored clinical trials come to fruition.

Could Cannabis be Sold Over the Counter?

The cannabis plant has been used in medicine for 6,000 years. However, there is still considerable debate around the role it plays in healthcare today. There are currently almost 400 active and completed clinical trials worldwide surrounding cannabidiol (CBD), a type of cannabinoid that makes up 40% of the cannabis plant’s extract.

Cannabis relies on CBD’s therapeutic properties, and recent studies suggest it may be useful in combating a variety of health conditions, such as:

Epilepsy

Schizophrenia

Multiple sclerosis

Migraines

Arthritis

Cancer side effects

As of 2019, 33 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for medical use. Its potential for pain management has led some experts to recommend it as an alternative to addictive painkillers, with one study of 13 states showing opiate-related deaths decreasing by over 33% in the six years since medical cannabis was legalized.

As the industry evolves, data is becoming increasingly important in understanding the potential of cannabis—both as a viable medical treatment, and as a recreational product. The shift away from anecdotal evidence towards big data will inform future policies, and give rise to a new era of consumer education.

Big Pharma’s Foray into Cannabis

Further legalization of cannabis will challenge Big Pharma’s bottom line, and poach more than $4 billion from pharma sales annually. In fact, medical cannabis sales are projected to reach $5.9 billion in 2019, from an estimated 24 million patients.

Seven of Canada’s top 10 cannabis patent holders are major multinational pharmaceutical companies, a trend that is not unique to Canada.

Company Rank 🇨🇦 Canadian Patents Company Rank 🇺🇸 U.S. Patents 1. Novartis 21 1. Abbvie 59 2. Pfizer 14 2. Sanofie 39 3. GW Pharmaceuticals 13 3. Merck 35 4. Ericsson 13 4. Bristol-Myers Squibb 34 5. Merck 11 5. GW Pharmaceuticals 28 6. Solvay Pharmaceuticals 7 6. Pfizer 25 7. Kao Corporation 7 7. Hebrew University of Jerusalem 19 8. Ogeda SA 7 8. Roche 17 9. Sanofi 6 9. University of Connecticut 16 10. University of Connecticut 6 10. U.S. Health and Human Services 13

It comes as no surprise that many pharmaceutical giants have already formed strong partnerships with cannabis companies, such as Novartis and Tilray, who will develop and distribute medical cannabis together in legal jurisdictions around the world.

Data is the Missing Link

While the body of knowledge about the many uses of cannabis continue to grow, clinical evidence is key for widespread adoption.

Products backed by data will be a defining criteria for major companies to come into the market en masse. And ultimately, Big Pharma’s entry could accelerate public understanding and confidence in cannabis as a viable option for a range of ailments, and mark the next major milestone for the industry."

Say hello to the ultimate payoff of the chip designer's much-maligned ATI acquisition in 2006: a wholesale rebranding campaign for the entire company.

AMD's corporate logo now includes a catchy ""The future is fusion"" blurb. The company explains: ""It's where customer needs, dreams, and desires bond with our own passion for engineering. [...] The future is Fusion. And it's only from AMD.""

The chipmaker could certainly use some polish on its public image, which has taken several shots to the gut recently. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has owned the high-performance chip market since it released the Core 2 product line, relegating AMD to the ""value"" spot rather than the ""top dawg with fat margins"" throne. The $5.4 billion ATI acquisition hasn't paid dividends yet, and AMD shares have plummeted from the lower $20s at the time of the ATI deal to $5.50 as I write this.

What is this ""Fusion"" business about?

In its most obvious sense, Fusion weds AMD's CPU technology to ATI's image-processing expertise. CPUs with integrated graphics cores are expected to launch next year, and the same approach should allow AMD to mix in other specialized chip architectures, such as physics processors, right in the processor itself.

That's not a big surprise after the recent explosion of multi-core processors, but it does take some extra work to make a bunch of different cores work together as efficiently as possible. The payoff could be huge, with improved overall performance, simpler and more compact system architectures, and the ability to mix and match technologies to fill the specific needs of niche markets like high-performance graphics, scientific computing, or plain old gaming.

This is where ATI's rubber meets the road. It's time to prove that the company was worth all those billions of dollars.

But wait -- there's more!

Beyond that obvious definition, Fusion is also ""AMD's working philosophy"" now, and it ""marries innovation with collaboration"" to ""change the way we live, work and play."" From that point of view, I think that AMD could have hired a PR firm to come up with a better name. (I doubt it ever did.)

If you say ""Fusion!"" in a crowd of technophiles today, they'll think I'm talking about any one of several completely different things:

Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) Fusion is a middleware application suite that includes products from acquired businesses like JD Edwards, BEA Systems, Siebel, Peoplesoft, and many more.

Web.com (NASDAQ:WWWW) released NetObjects Fusion 11 this summer, updating one of the oldest Web design tools to current standards and trends.

released NetObjects Fusion 11 this summer, updating one of the oldest Web design tools to current standards and trends. Asian fusion cuisine brings together delicacies from places like India, Japan, Mongolia, and Vietnam on one plate for a deliciously diverse culinary adventure. Yum!

There's plenty more, but you get my drift. ""Fusion"" may be a trendy choice, but it isn't a particularly original name for a strategy of blending disparate elements into a coherent(-ish) product offering. When you rebrand a whole company like this, you're clearly aiming to stand out from the competition, not blend into it. This particular effort is simply muddling the issue.

AMD would be better off taking a page from the Altria (NYSE:MO) playbook -- that name doesn't really mean anything, but it is a unique moniker that sets the company apart from both its rivals and a badly tar-stained history.

""It's only from AMD."" Hardly. I applaud the company's effort, but lament its execution. Let's hope that this chipmaker's pudding is chock full of proof.

We've fused together further Foolishness:"

Well today may have been my most successful futures trading day since I began here and the week has been spectacular! It has just seemed so easy when you give us a range and I execute properly. Thanks once again for teaching me to fish. My portfolio gained over 10% this week which is just amazing. Craiga620

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! How will I ever do anything else in my life that will compare to the wild ride you get trading an ultra etf in the most volatile sector in the stock market the day before option expiration? Matt1966

Phil - I got your earlier trade a month or so ago on MSFT 2015 32/37 BCS, selling 2015 30 puts. Nice up 75% now! Jomptien

Phil - I know I am small change compared to most others members, but I just wanted to let you know that during the last two weeks with the shorts you and others suggested I have 6 winners and 5 losers. My losers were small because I tried to follow your guidelines as best I could. On the other hand my winners on average were around 50%. Consequently, I am up $2000 in 14 days. Thank you for your patience and help. I think I am making progress getting rid of some of my poor trading habits of the past! DCalrk41

I would like to thank Phil and PSW crew for the insight and assistance (even the liberals). In December I initiated long stock positions buying stock, writing calls and puts in AAPL, WFR and CHK (scaling in and out). Over the last week I have been trimming back my positions selling stock and taking out my callers and putters. I am now back to my initial 25% position that I started with in December. However this time, my cost basis on shares AAPL, WFR, and CHK is $0! With money to spare from those positions. Texasmotion

/NKD- Kownichiwa Cowboy!! One week of patience and scaling in and out pays off. This is a testament to Phil's fundamental analysis with the PSW technique. Thanks Phil. JohnO

I have definitely learned to take smaller wins early and be happy with that. Lately, I've aimed for $250 profit per day. Doing that daily/weekly x 48 weeks (assuming I take some time off) works out to 60k per year. That's a lot of money!! $250 moves happen all the time if you just wait for them. JeffDoc

Phil/thankyou. Phil, I went over the recording of last weeks webinar. I liked it a lot and wanted to thank you. I thought the case studies (company reviews) were detailed, I learned more about selling puts process and also what happens if stock continues to go down after that, I liked the fact that we discuss so many different avenues like stocks, optiond, futures, oil, commodities etc… I replayed portions of it multiple times to make sure I was grasping it but wanted to say good job. Thanks… Nramanuja

Phil.... I remember back in March of '09, you stated "" Unless you think the country is going to hell in a hand-basket, NOW is the time to do your buying"". Do you remember ? I took your advice, and bought leap $2.00 calls on F, approximately 200,000 shares using the options, for just pennies. Now that was the best Ford I ever owned.... made over $1 mil - thanks go to you Phil. I now drive a Mercedes but still ""love"" the Ford. 1234Gel

Phil, Passed a milestone today since joining 2 months ago. 25% of my account is in buy/writes, bull call spreads and disaster hedges. A majority of the trades were taken directly from your ideas or someone else`s contributions. Some were daytrades that became spreads. That part of my account is up 30% as of today. I don`t worry about it, or mess with it much, did a few rolls etc. Rest of the account is there to day trade, cover the writes and take advantage of opportunities. Thanks to everyone who contributes here, what a sweet way to trade, so many opportunities. Ben1Be

Great calls this week! SNS1

Phil- I want to let you know that you really helped me make some money this morning when I probably would have lost on my own. I was stuck in doctors waiting rooms most of the morning starting at 8AM. By following the game plan you laid out and using my smartphone, I went short on oil whenever we got to 61.50 and long at 61 waiting for the spikes ahead of inventory. When 10:30 rolled around I was out after selling longs at 61.60 a few minutes earlier. I went short at 61.75-61.80 and voila, rode it down to 60.60 or so. Thank you. craigsa620

Phil - Wow…wow. The vision and inate grasp of the options world you posess is rather staggering. It's this type of experience that I really hope to develop. I'm afraid I still can't see the moves, but I WILL learn. I cannot thank you enough for the patience, knowledge and effort you put into this place. Please keep it going! Where

I read with great interest your statement the other day that the DX is unlikely to break 76 or there will be great hell to pay, torrential amounts of tears shed, and gnashing of dentures all over the world. Well. I have had several short DX contracts in the $78ish range during the last month and upon your two statements 1) don't be greedy, and 2) 76 could be a bottom, I yesterday put a buy GTC order to close my positions at 76 and for some inexplicable reason the DX spiked down after the close and now I can safely say that once again you have confirmed for me that you have been one of the best investment services I have yet to come across. Almost to the point that I'm beginning to think that maybe I'm completely wrong about my political stance as well. Almost. In any event, I wanted you to know that this has been my third execution based on your comments and recommendations that I have followed and this one has also worked to my advantage. My subscription fee has been more than justified for the next year and there's some left over to pay for my stay in Toronto this week, dinner at Joso's in the Yorkville section of town.

10/15/2014: Phil…..been travelling more than not but reading and watching you guys every night. This is to say a big thank you. Even though I don't have the time to trade every day now I set up hedges and base long term strategy on PSW. I now it may sound like BS to some readers but my 401k is down a mere 3%. It hardly gets my attention when I open my brokerage portfolio accounts. And that is by using your longer term hedges and strategies. I don't need to be a day trader to take advantage of PSW. At this time in my life when I cant trade every day……. not losing what we've gained moves front and center. It's just a great feeling to watch your brokerage account hold steady in a sea of red. Thanks Teacher. Livingfull

Phil, I have to hand it to you. It seemed that you were the only person on the planet that thought stocks falling was still possible. I am glad I listened. About the end of the year I was really beginning to second guess though. Thanks for suggesting taking some profits last Nov. It no longer looks like I missed much. rj_jarboe

I cannot believe the success I have had in the last 6 months because of what I have learned here! It has been truly life changing. It's like the old adage about teaching someone how to fish instead of just giving them a fish. Thank you Phil, I am forever grateful and hope I have helped someone else along the way. Craigsa620

The virtuous trade / Phil throws out so many ideas, that understandably he rejects all calls for a running total of how all """"quoted"""" ideas are performing – it would be unworkable. But without such a list, I think it behooves us to call out the trades that have made a difference. January 13 expiration is going to be a big month for me as a significant number of sold put positions will expire worthless. One example of the power of patience and leaving well alone: VLO – sold Jan 13, 17.5 puts for $3.45 – and this trade was placed in August 2011. VLO is currently a tad over $35! And as time went by, and I got more experienced – with the help of Phil and the contributions from board members, I started selling short term puts and calls around this position. Sometimes having to roll, sometimes doubling down but always knowing what I was getting into, and feeling very calm and focussed that whatever happened I could handle it. And if I couldn't then there was always Phil to lend a helping hand. All in all, my profits since August 2011 would qualify as a tidy addition to any earnings from the day job. Thank you Sir.

There are many different ways to assess the value of a company, and the methods used to analyze securities and make investment decisions fall into two very broad categories: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating a security that entails attempting to measure its intrinsic value by examining related economic, financial and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Fundamental analysts attempt to study everything that can affect the security’s value, including macroeconomic factors (like the overall economy and industry conditions) and company-specific factors (like financial condition and management).[1] Technical analysis takes a completely different approach. It is a method of evaluating securities by analyzing statistics generated by market activity, such as past prices and volume. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security’s intrinsic value, but instead use charts and other tools to identify patterns that can suggest future activity.[2]

Figure 12. Technical analysis noted on the graph, Fundamental analysis income statement.

Out of the two, fundamental analysis is the more widespread discipline, by far. There is a lot of criticism concerning technical analysis, and the criticisms are derived from the Efficient Market Theory. The Efficent Market Theory states that the market’s current price is accurate and correct and that past information (same as charts) is already discounted into the stock. There are variations of this theory; however, most of these people believe that if technical analysis works then market efficiency may be questionable.

There are many papers, in fact, that say TA is often more reliable and profitable using a few finely derived rules. Ramazan Gençay wrote a paper entitled, “The predictability of security returns with simple technical trading rules.” Here is the abstract:

Technical traders base their analysis on the premise that the patterns in market prices are assumed to recur in the future, and thus, these patterns can be used for predictive purposes. This paper uses the daily Dow Jones Industrial Average Index from 1897 to 1988 to examine the linear and nonlinear predictability of stock market returns with simple technical trading rules. The nonlinear specification of returns are modeled by single layer feed forward networks. The results indicate strong evidence of nonlinear predictability in the stock market returns by using the past buys and sell signals of the moving average rules.

Does all of this mean that one is better than the other? No! Not only is it important to master TA, but you must also be aware of a company’s financial strength. Because the stock market can move in an irrational manner, charts will not accurately represent the company’s value. In addition, TA can be used because financial statements and management “misstate the truth” in some cases. Knowing how to perform both fundamental and technical due diligence is essential for both investors and traders.

Are there times where one technique is more effective than the other? Yes! It all depends on 1) the time horizon, 2) the trader’s personality and type. Figure 13 is a chart that plots the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of both types of analyses as the time horizon shifts from short-term to long-term. In my opinion, TA is most effective in the short-term and less effective in the long-term, and fundamental analysis is most effective in the long-term and less effective in the short-term. The ability to perform both analyses gives investors and traders flexibility throughout each timeframe.

Short-term is defined as micro-trading (minutes), day trading (hours), and swing trading (days). Intermediate-term is defined as any holding period between several months up to a year and long-term is defined as 1+ years.

Figure 13. TA and FA effectiveness in long and short term trading.

Types of Technical Trading: Scalping, Day, Momentum, Swing, & Position Trading

There are five main types of trading that technical traders can utilize: scalping, day, momentum, swing, and position trading.

Scalping

Scalping (or micro-trading) is all about taking very small profits, repeatedly (welcome HAL9000). Scalpers believe that stocks go in a certain direction, even for a little bit. They also believe that when trading, unfavorable events can be avoided. Even though scalping may not be suitable for the ordinary public trader, it’s important to know that scalpers provide liquidity throughout the day. Typically, trades last between seconds to minutes, so given the volume; it is not surprising that scalpers amass the most transaction fees. Scalping is an expert skill because it is easier to take a larger loss that will wipe out the entire day’s gains, so it is not recommended for beginners. The biggest benefit is if it is done correctly, the small profits will add up.

Day Trading

Day trading is all about buying and selling stocks on the same day and you are not holding positions overnight. Comparing day trading to scalping, this particular style calls for holding stocks for minutes to hours vs. seconds to minutes. Because of the short duration of trades, there is little room for error. Day traders even have their own set of tax rules by the IRS. The biggest benefit is that the trader liquidates their position at the end of the day.

Both scalping and day trading require strong discipline, the time and ability to learn how to rapidly trade, a tested and profitable strategy, and enough capital to withstand sudden and enormous draw downs (losses).

The next two types of trading take advantage of short-term trends and they are momentum and swing trading (see Optrader for his website on swing trading). Both are not as rapid as Scalping and Day trading, but that doesn’t make these strategies any less profitable – just ask Optrader!

Momentum Trading

In momentum trading, the trader identifies a stock that’s breaking out and jumps on to capture as much of the momentum on the way up as possible. The trader gets in at the very beginning of a trend and allows other buyers, who identify the trend, to provide the fuel to lift the stock higher. Enersis S.A. (ENI) in Figure 14 is an example of momentum trading.

Figure 14. Momentum trading of ENI.

The typical time frame for momentum trading is from several hours to several days. Although momentum trading does carry overnight risk and day trading or scalping do not, there’s a possibility that there is enough force for the stock to gap up higher.

Swing Trading

Swing Trading is the art of capturing the short-term trend. This style and position trading are the only two types of trading where a person with a full-time job can still consistently trade well part-time. Since the holding period is several days, intraday moves will not affect the swing trader as much as it would for a day trader. Typical holding periods for a swing trade is between 3-7 days. Swing trading is best used when the market or stock is in a neutral trading range, meaning the market isn’t going anywhere but up and down without much price progress. In VZ, swing trading is effective if a trader wants to take advantage of the ups and downs of this range. Notice that long-term position trading (covered next) or momentum trading will not work in this type of environment but that doesn’t mean you cannot make a profit. Use swing trading when the market or a particular stock is going nowhere. Figure 15 shows how a swing trader could follow the short term trends of Verizon (VZ).

Figure 15. Swing trading Verizon.

Position Trading

Position Traders hold stocks for weeks or months (see Figure 14 of ENI above). This style of trading is synonymous with “trend following”. The only reason to become a position trader is if you anticipate the current trend to continue for a much longer term than a momentum or swing trade. Another example of a position trade is in natural gas and oil. Petrohawk (HK) in Figure 16 has become a favorite in chat and many traders are long the stock (accumulation phase). For now, the traders are taking advantage of the stock’s wild swings, but as a position trader, they can buy on the way up and sell or cover their stock with in-the-money options when the trend changed (e.g., HK had a bearish engulfing in July which would have signaled to sell or cover). The position trader is not limited to only buying, the trader can also short (or short sell the stock). In each instance, the holding periods are for several weeks to months. Position trading gives traders a lot of freedom for those who cannot trade frequently. Profit potential is not diminished and position traders can make considerable gains. In HK’s case, over 100% going long and over 100% going short!

Figure 16. Position trader buying and selling in Petrohawk.

Now that the different strategies have been presented, the trader must decide how long the trader wants to hold a position. Here are some questions to ask:

Am I short-term or long-term oriented?

Am I short-term or long-term oriented? How much time do I have during the day to trade? Do I work full-time?

Am I patient and able to wait, or do I need to see results quickly?

Finally, the current market environment will greatly influence what type of trading is appropriate. Mastering one style is very important, but also the trader needs to be proficient in others. If in doubt, stay in cash. Standing aside is considered a defensive position and there’s nothing wrong with waiting for an opportunity.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)

President Trump alleged Wednesday that Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an assertion that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer, who said his client had not received anything from the investment.

Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, “Secret Empires,” that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013.

His father, former vice president Joe Biden, had traveled to China at the time to meet with that country’s leaders while he was in office. Schweizer wrote in a summary of the 2018 book that 10 days after the Bidens arrived in China, “Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.”

Trump on Wednesday put it this way: “When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that’s a horrible thing. I think it’s a horrible thing.”

Trump made his comments on the day that the White House released a transcript of his conversation in which he urged the president of Ukraine to look into Hunter Biden’s work as a board member of a gas company in that country, a job that was given when Joe Biden was vice president and dealing with Ukraine policy.

House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while Trump has tried to keep the focus on what he calls corrupt acts by the Bidens.

In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.

Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013.

Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion.

Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount.

However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.

Moreover, Mesires said, it was not until October 2017 that Hunter Biden acquired a financial stake in BHR. Hunter Biden bought a 10 percent equity interest that was worth $430,000 in July, Mesires said. At least half of the firm’s stake is owned by Chinese entities, according to business records.

“To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,” Meseris said in a statement Wednesday. “The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden’s role with BHR.”

Drew Angerer/Getty Images

President Donald Trump should be impeached. Not just for his manipulation of Ukraine, but for his overwhelming pattern of treachery against the United States.

The president swears that his pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s leading opponent in the 2020 election, was perfectly innocent. Despite an array of evidence that Trump abused power—a whistleblower complaint, an arm-twisting phone call with Ukraine’s president, suspension of U.S. military aid to increase the heat, and an influence campaign in Ukraine by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani—Trump shrugs off the whole story as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt.” He says he’ll beat the rap.

But Trump’s rap sheet is a lot longer than one story. What he has done in Ukraine—defending a corrupt foreign official, enlisting a foreign government to fight his domestic political opponents, and circumventing or removing American security officials who stood in his way—is part of a pattern. In transactions with at least seven countries, Trump has pursued personal advantage at the expense of the United States. In each case, he has explicitly attacked America, its political leaders, or its national security officials.

Here are the seven countries.

1. Russia. Trump solicited criminal campaign help from Russia and defended collaboration with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. These aren’t unproven allegations. They’re recorded on video. At a press conference in July 2016, Trump urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails. When a reporter asked Trump whether he had “any pause about asking a foreign government—Russia, China, anybody—to interfere, to hack … anybody in this country,” Trump replied, “No, it gives me no pause.” In 2017, when he was asked about the Trump Tower meeting at which his top campaign officials sought political help from Russian emissaries, Trump said there was no difference between getting help from Russians and getting it from Americans.

Trump views competition with other countries as a venue in which to outscore and humiliate the real enemy: his fellow American politicians.

Trump has repeatedly asserted that the United States is no better than Russia. During his campaign, and again as president, he defended Russian President Vladimir Putin’s record of killing dissidents, claiming that “our country does plenty of killing also” and isn’t “so innocent.” Trump said Putin was better than President Barack Obama, calling the Russian president “a leader, you know, unlike what we have in this country.” Last month, at a press conference, Trump boasted five times that Putin had “outsmarted” Obama.

Trump took specific steps to protect Putin from the U.S. government. He repeatedly defended Putin against the 2017 U.S. intelligence report that exposed Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump also dismissed the American officials behind the report as liars and hacks. He denounced the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and “the intelligence community.” Last year, after a Department of Justice indictment documented the involvement of 12 Russian intelligence officers in the election hacks, Trump dismissed the evidence and defended Putin’s denial.

2. North Korea. Last year, Trump formed a public-relations alliance with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, based on the mutually advantageous fiction that North Korea was dismantling or halting its nuclear missile program. Since then, Trump has followed Kim’s lead, ridiculing American officials and politicians Kim doesn’t like. In May, Trump repeatedly applauded North Korea for calling Biden a “fool of low IQ.” In June, Trump portrayed the United States as North Korea’s lowly suitor, boasting—falsely—that Obama had “called Kim Jong-un on numerous occasions to meet” and that despite “begging for meetings constantly,” Obama had been turned down. Trump has also endorsed Kim’s attacks on Trump’s own advisers. Two weeks ago, after North Korea denounced U.S. national security adviser John Bolton as a “human defect” and said Bolton should vanish, Trump fired Bolton and defended North Korea’s invective against him.

Kim, like Putin, enjoys Trump’s protection from U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump has brushed aside the agencies’ evidence of Kim’s ongoing nuclear and missile work, calling such allegations “fake news” from “the Opposition Party.” Last month, Trump again followed Kim’s lead, criticizing joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. And on Monday, despite international alarm over North Korea’s persistent missile launches, the president defended them.

3. Saudi Arabia. Trump is shielding the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, from American intelligence that shows MBS directed the murder of a U.S. resident, journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Last fall, a CIA assessment concluded that MBS ordered the assassination. Trump lied about the assessment, claiming that the CIA “didn’t make a determination.” Congress then instructed Trump to issue a legally mandated report on Khashoggi’s death, but Trump refused. Three months ago, when Trump was asked whether the FBI should look into the case, he said it had been sufficiently investigated, and he claimed that “nobody so far has pointed directly a finger” at MBS. When a reporter pointed out that the CIA had in fact implicated MBS, Trump replied, “I just don’t want to talk about intelligence.”

4. China. Trump often complains about China’s trade surplus with the United States. But he always insists that the real culprit is the U.S. government. That’s because Trump views competition with other countries, like collaboration with other countries, as a venue in which to outscore and humiliate the real enemy: his fellow American politicians. At least 19 times since Trump became president, he has declared, “I don’t blame China.” Instead, he has faulted America. Last fall, he explained, “I don’t blame China. I blame our country.” Last year, and again two months ago, he repeated, “I don’t blame China. I blame the United States.”

Trump’s contempt for America, relative to China, goes beyond trade policy. He also believes that China’s Communist government is morally superior to the Democratic Party of the United States. Earlier this year, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer refused to fund Trump’s border wall, Trump protested, “I find China, frankly, in many ways, to be far more honorable than Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy. I really do. I think that China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.”

5. Israel. This year, Trump has targeted four Democratic congresswomen: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. He has portrayed them as un-American, claiming that they “came from countries” with bad governments (three of them were born here) and should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” But it’s Trump, not the congresswomen, who has dragged a foreign government into the feud.

Last month, Omar and Tlaib made plans to travel to Israel. Although Israel objected to their support of boycotts against it, it decided to permit their visit, on the grounds that denying entry to members of Congress would be an offense against the United States. But Trump felt no such loyalty to his country. He openly urged Israel to bar the two Americans—in fact, he warned Israel that it would look weak if it approved their trip—and he also lobbied Israeli officials in private. Under his pressure, Israel reversed itself and blocked the visit.

Trump proceeded to exploit Israel’s rebuke of the two congresswomen, just as he had exploited Putin’s criticisms of Clinton and North Korea’s criticisms of Biden. He also suggested that American Jews should put allegiance to Israel before their duties as American citizens. “Any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat,” he argued, were “being very disloyal to Israel.”

6. Turkey. Trump has consistently excused Turkish aggression against the United States. In 2017, he defended his former national security adviser Michael Flynn after Flynn was exposed as a Turkish foreign agent who had spiked a U.S. plan to arm America’s Kurdish allies. Then Trump refused to criticize Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan—and even expressed sympathy to Erdogan in a phone call—after Erdogan’s thugs assaulted protesters in Washington. Last year, the White House pressed the Justice Department to look for ways to expel Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish dissident, despite having been told there were no legal grounds to do so. And in a dispute over whether to betray the Kurds in Syria, Trump sided with Erdogan against U.S. officials. Trump capped his treachery by firing Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had protested his abandonment of the Kurds.

7. Ukraine. What we know so far about Trump’s backstage manipulation of Ukraine fits the pattern. But you can also see several of his pathologies out in the open.

One of them is his incomprehension that he’s supposed to be a teammate, not an enemy, of previous American presidents. At last month’s G-7 meeting, Trump dismissed Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a Ukrainian province, as a personal embarrassment to Obama. That invasion was Obama’s problem, not Trump’s, the president argued. Therefore, in Trump’s view, the punishment Russia had suffered for it—being kicked out of what was then the G-8—should be overturned, now that Trump was president. Crimea was “taken away from President Obama, not taken away from President Trump,” said Trump. “It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out … that was his determination.”

Another pathology, familiar from Trump’s interactions with Russia, China, and North Korea, is his habit of belittling domestic critics by playing on the idea of American inferiority. “Our media has become the laughingstock of the world,” the president told reporters on Friday, castigating them—in the presence of Australia’s prime minister—for pursuing the Ukraine story. “The media of our country is laughed at all over the world now. You’re a joke.” On Tuesday, at a meeting with Iraq’s president, Trump claimed that every foreign head of state with whom he had spoken at the U.N. General Assembly said the investigations of him were “crazy.”

A third pattern, consistent with Trump’s treatment of Russia, North Korea, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, is his attacks on U.S. intelligence officials. On Saturday, he tweeted smears by two Fox News commentators. One called the Ukraine whistleblower’s complaint a “seditious effort” against Trump. The other warned that “an American spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president.”

Trump says Ukraine is part of a much bigger story. “It’s just a continuation of the witch hunt,” he scoffed on Tuesday. He’s right that we’re seeing the same thing over and over. But what we’re seeing isn’t witches. It’s a president betraying his country. Draw up the articles of impeachment."

The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is about to get some serious competition. It's held the title of the world's busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic since 1998 — but China's newest airport is trying to challenge that.

China opened Beijing Daxing Airport on Wednesday, the second international airport in the capital city. When it reaches full operational capacity, expected in the next several years, 100 million passengers are forecast to go through the airport annually.

The International Air Transport Association expects Asia Pacific to be the biggest driver of air passenger demand in the 20 years through 2035.

Specifically, China will replace the U.S. as the world's largest aviation market in about five years, the association predicts. The market is defined by traffic to and from the country, as well as domestic flights within its borders.

The bulk of the growth in Chinese air travel came in the three decades since the government began earnest efforts to reduce state control of the economy and open up its market to foreign access.

In 1974, the earliest data available from The World Bank, just 710,000 passengers were carried in China. That climbed to 11.1 million in 1989, and multiplied manifold to 611.4 million in 2018, the bank's data showed.

The existing Beijing Capital International Airport opened in 1958. It already holds the title of second-largest airport by number of passengers, according to Airports Council International.

The number of passengers in Beijing Capital grew 5.4% on year to 101 million in 2018 — that's compared to a year-on-year growth of 3.3% growth to 107 million for Atlanta over the same period, the data showed.

Daxing International Airport was built to expand the capital city's capacity for visitors and alleviate pressure on the main airport. The first construction phase was completed in less than five years. Initial capacity for the star-shaped terminal building is 45 million passengers, but there are plans to expand the airport's capacity to 72 million by 2025, and ultimately 100 million, according to the Centre for Aviation."
1254,,https://mashable.com/article/climate-change-report-oceans-un/,2019-09-25T10:42:39+00:00,U.N. confirms the ocean is screwed,"The ocean isn't alright.

The seas, which hold some 332,519,000 cubic miles of water, are warming, rising, acidifying, and losing oxygen. And a new comprehensive U.N. climate special report, released Wednesday, presents an encyclopedic review of how Earth's oceans and ice sheets have been altered as the world relentlessly warms.

Over 100 scientists from 36 nations (who cited over 6,900 studies) wrote the stark dispatch, called the ""Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.""

Today's disrupted seas, though, are just the inception of the ocean's transition. That's because the oceans are the true keeper of climate change: Most of the heat humanity traps on the planet gets soaked up by the ocean. And modern civilization won't stop saturating the atmosphere with heat-trapping carbon dioxide anytime soon.

""Over 90 percent of heat from global warming is warming the oceans,"" said Josh Willis, a NASA oceanographer who had no role in the U.N. report.

""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" Willis emphasized.

For anyone inhabiting the planet in the coming decades and centuries, this means increased sea level rise and warming, among other effects. The problem will get worse, but humanity still can limit the consequences, specifically by radically curbing carbon emissions.

""If we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable,"" Hoesung Lee, chair of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said in a statement.

""Global warming is really ocean warming.""

""Even with aggressive [carbon] mitigation efforts, we’re still going to have to deal with consequences of an ecosystem and an environment that has changed,"" noted Jeremy Mathis, a longtime Arctic researcher and a current board director at the National Academies of Sciences. Mathis had no involvement with the U.N. IPCC report.

(Reminder: Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions are now skyrocketing. CO2 levels haven't been this high in at least 800,000 years — though more likely millions of years. What's more, carbon levels are now rising at rates that are unprecedented in both the geologic and historic record.)

The report is exhaustive. But here are some of its many important takeaways:

1. Sea level rise will probably be worse than you imagine

The U.N. report concluded that sea level rise will continue for centuries. In a fairy tale world, wherein society can curb Earth's warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-Industrial Revolution temperatures (this scenario is now nearly impossible to achieve), sea levels will likely rise between one and two feet by the century's end, the report found.

But if emissions continue to increase at persistently high levels, the IPCC found sea levels would rise between nearly two feet and over three and a half feet (that's over a meter!). That's because Earth's most massive ice sheets, on Antarctica and Greenland, ""are projected to lose mass at an increasing rate throughout the 21st century and beyond,"" the report said.

Even so, U.N. climate estimates are often conservative. Accelerated melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets — which are presently both experiencing accelerated melt — could boost sea levels significantly more than the report considers.

Sea level rise documented via satellite observations. Image: nasa

""I don't think there’s any science that rules out two meters by 2100,"" said NASA's Willis. ""I think most people who study Greenland and Antarctica think [sea level rise] could be higher than current projections.""

In large part, that's because warming oceans eat away at and melt the edges of glaciers, said Willis, noting that this is a significant effect Arctic and ocean researchers are just beginning to grasp.

And guess what? The oceans are certainly expected to keep warming. ""Over the 21st century, the ocean is projected to transition to unprecedented conditions with increased temperatures"" among other changes, the report concluded.

2. The ocean is supercharging storms

The IPCC report underscores that tropical cyclones, which include hurricanes, are projected to grow increasingly severe, specifically with higher winds and extreme rainfall. That's because cyclones feed off warm ocean waters. Storms add to their girth by sucking up evaporated seawater and build stronger winds by converting water vapor into energy.

Research has shown remarkably warm waters have outweighed other factors in allowing recent Atlantic storms to intensify into powerful cyclones.

But a cyclone doesn't need to pack intense winds to be devastating. Storms these days often carry more water, and warmer sea surface temperatures are the reason why.

""The oceans are much warmer than they were 50 years ago,"" said Mathis, who formerly served as the director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Arctic Research Program. He noted that warmer oceans evaporate more water vapor into the atmosphere, providing storms more fuel.

""Warmer oceans will drive extreme rainfall events,"" said Mathis, citing how Tropical Storm Imelda recently deluged the Texas coast. Imelda became one of the wettest cyclones in U.S. history. ""That storm spun up [in intensity] in 12 hours,"" noted Mathis. ""Suddenly the region got 42 inches of rain.""

3. Everything is changing

The special report focuses not just on the ocean, but on the planet's water everywhere — also known as the hydrosphere. This means glaciers atop Mt. Everest, ice sheets in Greenland, and ocean water thousands of feet beneath the surface.

""I think that the most important part of this work and message is that anthropogenic climate change is affecting all aspects of the hydrosphere, a key ingredient for life,"" said Jeremy Owens, a marine biogeochemist at Florida State University who had no involvement in the report.

Importantly, Earth's ice sheets and glaciers are ""shrinking,"" the report underscored. Indeed, glaciers on every continent except Australia (which has no glaciers) are retreating, or dying. And critically, mountains are losing snowpack, which is vital for providing people with water (via snowmelt) during the warm or dry season.

""Snow is good, but we've got less snow,"" Heidi Steltzer, a lead author of the IPCC report, said in a call with reporters.

The consequences of a warming ocean, though, will be many. Climate change, noted Owens, will affect water temperature (which has dramatic consequences for marine life), the ability of nutrients to disperse around the ocean, acidity in the oceans (as the oceans absorb CO2 from the air), and oxygen levels in the water — which sea creatures require for respiration.

4. The Arctic we once knew is gone

The Arctic is the most disrupted place on Earth. That's because it has warmed more than twice as much as the rest of the globe. Consequently, the great blanket of sea ice that covers the vast Arctic Ocean is vanishing.

Just this week, Arctic sea ice dropped to its second-lowest level on record, which is over 2 million square kilometers below the average minimum ice extent during previous, cooler decades. ""The rapid changes in the Arctic are some of the clearest indicators of anthropogenic climate change,"" Zack Labe, a climate scientist and Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Irvine, told Mashable.

July - *lowest on record*

August - 2nd lowest on record pic.twitter.com/LYsN0Z8Dt8 — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) September 22, 2019

The report found that if civilization stabilizes the climate at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the Arctic will continue to thin, but will likely become completely ice-free by the summer's end (in September) only about once every 100 years.

But if the planet warms to 2 degrees Celsius this century (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the Arctic will likely be ice-free in September once every three years. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 1800s. So 1.5 Celsius is fast approaching.

5. Trust your eyes

The research presented in this IPCC report is valuable, said Mathis from the National Academies of Sciences. But ""you don't have to be a scientist anymore to see what's going on,"" he emphasized.

That's because the consequences of a relentlessly warming ocean and atmosphere are easily visible, to everyone.

Twice in the last three years, the gulf coast of Texas has had storm events that dropped over 40 inches of rain, Mathis noted, including the largest rain event in U.S. history.

And with Tropical Storm Imelda, Texas has now likely experienced five ""500-year floods"" (which should have a 1 in 500 chance of occurring in any given year) in the last five years.

Amazing! Yesterday, an estimated 4 million people in 160+ countries demonstrated for climate action. One of the largest political demonstrations in world history. #ClimateStrike



But the hard work is still ahead, rapidly cutting carbon emissions to stabilize the climate. pic.twitter.com/L3gNjYjkFF — Robert Rohde (@RARohde) September 21, 2019

""That’s extraordinary, that's exceptional,"" said Mathis. ""You don't have to be a scientist to know that’s not normal.""

""Trust your own eyes,"" he added.

The warming, disrupted oceans are here. And with increased carbon emissions, they are expected to warm, rise, and continue rising. That's a rule of physics.

""We’re staring down the barrel of some big economic and environmental impacts that have already started,"" said NASA's Willis, noting sea level rise projections.

""All the projections show they are going to get a lot worse."""

First, Giuliani insisted that there was nothing wrong with Trump asking Zelensky to investigate Biden because there was a vast conspiracy to frame Trump that originated in Ukraine that included Biden, Hillary Clinton and George Soros. Part of this conspiracy, Giuliani claimed, was falsifying documents in order to frame former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is serving a seven-year prison sentence for money laundering, witness tampering, and assorted other charges.

The “Fox & Friends” hosts then steered the conversation back to a bombshell Washington Post story that dropped on Tuesday night in which multiple government officials blamed Giuliani for getting them into a “sh*t show” by inserting himself into diplomacy with Ukraine.

Giuliani responded to this by calling all of these officials “disloyal.” Rudy also insisted at one point during the interview that the State Department should be “grateful” that he inserted himself into diplomacy because otherwise no one would have pushed Ukraine to investigate Biden.

The hosts then asked Giuliani about Trump’s reported requests to have the Ukrainian government investigate Biden, and Giuliani insisted that the president didn’t say anything wrong before revealing that he’d had the entire transcript of the conversation, which is supposed to be classified information, read aloud to him. This is particularly eyebrow raising because Giuliani is not a government official and is instead serving as the president’s personal attorney.

The former New York mayor then stated that Trump would have been derelict in his duties if he didn’t push Zelensky to investigate his political rivals.

Giuliani concluded his interview by waxing nostalgic about his career as a prosecutor and then linking it to his current efforts to ensnare the Biden family.

“A lot of alleged criminals are not that smart,” Giuliani said. “That’s how we catch them.”

But here is a compilation of Trump’s hints in the call:

“I would like to have the attorney general call you. … It’s very important that you do it. … I will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the attorney general. … If you could speak to him, that would be great. … If you can look into it [the Biden matter] … it sounds horrible to me. … I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call. … I’m sure you will figure it out. … Your economy is going to get better and better, I predict. … I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. … Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.”

If that presidential call were set to music, it could be the soundtrack for a “Godfather” movie.

The Times reports that the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community — each appointed by Trump — both referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation into the president’s actions.

Surprise! Barr’s Justice Department decided not to pursue the matter.

As for the assertion that the real corruption is that of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, that’s false. Ukraine said in May that there was no evidence of illegality by Hunter. I do think that he inappropriately played on his father’s job as vice president to get a board seat with a Ukrainian gas company, just as Trump’s children — and Trump himself — have monetized Trump’s presidency. But whatever Hunter’s impropriety, there is zero evidence of misconduct by his father.

Journalists may try to be evenhanded by saying that Trump did this while Biden did that. That is false equivalence. Let’s be clear: Joe Biden appears to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing in this case, while Trump tried to use the power of the federal government and almost $400 million in taxpayer money to coerce Ukraine into meddling in a U.S. election.

Fresh from allegations of collusion with Russia to win the 2016 election, Trump turns out to have been trying to collude with Ukraine to arrange foreign interference in the 2020 election.

An impeachment inquiry will now unfold, and there’s no reason to prejudge the outcome or rush the process. Let the evidence emerge and be debated.

No one should be gleeful, for an impeachment process is a trauma for our country — and I’m not sure that Democrats living in blue bubbles appreciate the risk that this process may end up helping Republican candidates.

But put politics aside.

Trump weaponized taxpayer dollars to coerce a foreign leader to target U.S. citizens with a criminal investigation, aiming to affect an American presidential election. Whether or not you believe that is impeachable, we should be able to agree that it is unconscionable.

Here was evidence, clear and unambiguous—and provided by the White House itself—that Trump requested a foreign leader to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump’s potential 2020 opponents. But where some saw an impeachable abuse of power, Trump defenders saw proof that he did nothing wrong, because his request for a “favor” wasn’t explicitly tied to the withholding of U.S. military aid.

Story Continued Below

Who’s right? We asked a group of legal experts what to make of it all. Do President Trump’s actions, as described in the summary of his phone call, meet the Constitution’s definition of an impeachable offense? If yes, why? If no, what more should be investigated, if anything?

Here are their responses:



***

The phone call ‘clearly establishes high crimes and misdemeanors’

Laurence H. Tribe is a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School.

The White House’s reconstruction of the phone call clearly establishes high crimes and misdemeanors, even if no further evidence were available. It shows a president responding to a desperate request by an ally for military assistance that he is secretly withholding by indicating that he might be able to help but—and his use of the word “though” is telling—he would appreciate the ally’s help in going after the former vice president and his son.

Even those looking for a quid pro quo should be satisfied that this conversation provided just that. But no quid pro quo is needed. For a president to use his foreign policy and military powers to encourage illegal foreign assistance in going after a political opponent in his reelection campaign is itself a high crime. And to involve his private attorney and the attorney general in that abuse of power compounds the offense.



***

‘The readout provokes far more questions than it answers’

Miriam H. Baer is a professor of law at Brooklyn Law School.

Several of the president’s most strident supporters may claim that this readout “exonerates” him of criminal wrongdoing, but that is the wrong question and, frankly, far from true. We aren’t asking whether Mr. Trump’s singular conversation violated a particular statute. We are asking whether he placed pressure on a foreign country to investigate a political rival’s family member, and whether that pressure rises to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors” such that he should be impeached. To that end, the House rightfully will want to investigate all of Mr. Trump’s direct and indirect contacts with Ukraine.

The readout itself alludes to contacts by Rudolph Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney. Those contacts—which Mr. Giuliani himself has stated he undertook as a lawyer acting on his client’s behalf—are sure to become a key focus of an impeachment inquiry. Moreover, the readout also references William Barr, the attorney general of the United States. If Mr. Barr becomes a fact witness (and that seems increasingly likely), he will be under immense pressure to recuse himself from the entire impeachment matter, which is significant in and of itself.

In sum, as has often been the case during the Trump administration, the readout provokes far more questions than it answers.



***

‘It is not a smoking gun, but raises concerns’

Laurie L. Levenson is a professor of law at Loyola Law School. She was formerly an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles.

It is not a smoking gun, but the call certainly raises concerns. President Trump just can’t seem to stop himself from infusing his personal political situation into his interactions with everyone, including foreign leaders. The key to understanding this call is seeing it in context. Robert Mueller, whom Trump demeans in the call, has just finished his report and testimony. Everyone is concerned with foreign interference with our elections. Nonetheless, Trump uses the occasion to ask for a favor: He wants Zelensky’s hand-picked prosecutor to go after Biden. With all the things our nation and the Ukraine need to worry about, why was this on the top of his agenda, and what favors was Trump willing to do in return? It will take more investigation to determine that.

It is also a bit curious why Attorney General Barr is allowing himself to be dragged into this. The downfall of prior administrations (think Richard Nixon’s) has been when those who are there to keep the president on the straight path lapse into doing his bidding. It would be very interesting to know what information Barr had about Ukraine’s investigation, and whether our own Justice Department was pursuing some angle of it as well.



***

If this isn’t impeachable, then what is?

David Alan Sklansky is a professor at Stanford Law School.

If it's not a gross abuse of the power of the presidency—in the language of the Constitution, a ""high crime or misdemeanor""—to push a foreign leader to pursue a criminal investigation of one of your principal political opponents, it's hard to say what would constitute an impeachable offense.

The defense that Trump and a few of his supporters have advanced today, that there was no pressure or ""quid pro quo,"" is unconvincing. First, there's no constitutional requirement of a quid pro quo; urging a foreign leader to investigate your political opponent would be an abuse of the position of the presidency even without any threat or pressure. Second, it seems pretty obvious that Trump was pressuring Zelensky—partly because of what Trump said, and partly because of the surrounding context of the phone call. Of course, we don't know the full context of the call, and that's important. Filling in that context will be one of the goals of the impeachment inquiry the speaker of the House announced yesterday, and it is part of the point of letting Congress hear the whistleblower's full story.

Trump revealed ‘his intent to use U.S. government resources and power to further his personal agenda’

Jennifer Taub is the Bruce W. Nichols visiting professor of law at Harvard Law School.

Placed in its full context, this partial summary of this single 30-minute phone conversation between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky provides compelling evidence of an impeachable offense. Remember at the time of the call, President Trump was withholding $250 million in military aid to Ukraine. Furthermore, this document itself states it is not a literal transcript, but based on “notes and recollections.”

Even so, on its face, if we follow the conversation flow and content, we see this account as quite damning. Immediately after the opening niceties, we have Trump telling Zelensky how helpful financially the U.S. has been to Ukraine. He speaks without interruption, repeatedly stressing a very one-sided relationship with the U.S. as giver and Ukraine as taker. Trump says, “We do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.” And importantly, before Trump pauses to let Zelensky speak, he intimates that he wants something in return: The “United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.”

Zelensky’s response indicates that he sees Trump seeking reciprocity. And he immediately mentions how he will spend money in the U.S. by buying our weapons. But — and here’s the critical part — Trump replies to make more clear that he wants a personal “favor” — and he actually uses the word “favor” here. The very first thing Trump asks for is information related to the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked into in summer 2016. Then he also asks for help digging up dirt on his perceived political rival, Joe Biden, and his son. To make clear these are personal favors, Trump repeatedly asks Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer. But by mixing in requests that Ukraine also work with Attorney General Barr, Trump reveals his intent to use U.S. government resources and power to further his personal agenda.

Taken altogether, this pressuring of a foreign government to dig up dirt on political opponents as assistance in an election is an abuse of power among other high crimes and misdemeanors.

‘This is clearly an impeachable offense’

Richard Painter was the White House’s chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush.

This is a blatant effort by Donald Trump to use extortion to enlist the help of a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's political rival here in the United States, for the personal political benefit of Trump. Trump also references Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation—parts of which are still ongoing—and enlists Ukraine's help with that investigation, a matter in which Trump has already obstructed justice as set forth in Part II of the Mueller Report.

This is clearly an impeachable offense, in addition to the other impeachable offenses, which include contempt of congressional subpoenas, unconstitutional foreign and domestic emoluments, the criminal campaign finance violations currently being prosecuted against his accomplices in the Southern District of New York, threats to the free press and more.

Without an impeachment process to check the White House, ‘the office of the presidency will morph into one with virtually unlimited power’

Kimberly Wehle is a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, and author of How to Read the Constitution — and Why.

Was this an impeachable offense? Democrats in Congress seem to increasingly believe the answer is yes, and this is a political judgment, not a legal one. Accordingly, the Constitution’s standard for an impeachable offense—“High Crimes and Misdemeanors”—does not require proof of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

But based on the phone call meeting notes alone, it is clear that President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to “look into” his political opponent and—in that connection—he served up the assistance of the attorney general of the United States. This is after the Ukrainian President brought up Senate-authorized military aid that we now know Trump was holding up, to the apparent dismay of a key supporter in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. This is not to mention the cumulative effect of this news in addition to the other concerns about this president.

Whether Trump is ultimately impeached is beside the point. This issue is that, absent invocation of some impeachment process to check the White House, the office of the presidency will morph into one with virtually unlimited power. This is bad for regular people, regardless of political party.

‘Trump conspired with a foreign government to manipulate it for partisan purposes. That’s clearly a “high crime”’

Corey Brettschneider is a professor of political science at Brown University. He is author of the forthcoming book, The Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents .

In my view, the transcript itself of Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president is impeachable. It’s a clear example of the president using his position as chief executive to manipulate the law for his own political gain. Public debate will focus on whether a quid pro quo happened, or whether a criminal offense was committed. But those are questions for courts; impeachment is a question for Congress, and Congress alone. The Constitution’s standard for impeachment is explicitly not a criminal one—“high crimes and misdemeanors” is not found in the penal code. Instead, the standards ask whether a president has violated his or her oath of office, undermining the Constitution’s values. Trump’s case here is clear. Instead of faithfully executing the law, carrying justice out impartially for all and making sure no one is above it, Trump conspired with a foreign government to manipulate it for partisan purposes. That’s clearly a “high crime” and the antithesis of faithful execution.

Still, more investigation would serve the public interest. Rep. Robert McClory was right, speaking in 1974 about the prospect of Nixon’s impeachment, that it should serve as a “guide for future presidents.” An overly narrow inquiry would wrongly suggest that none of Trump’s other violations have been impeachable. Beyond the Ukraine call, Trump’s potential obstruction of justice detailed in the Mueller report, his failure to report Russian interference in the election, and his quest for intellectual copyright from China while president, among other emolument violations, all warrant careful congressional scrutiny and could reasonably be found impeachable."

Now I just get the Stock World Weekly summary, which I find invaluable. Phil does not baby people and certainly can't make someone into a successful stock operator who does not make the effort on their own behalf, but he is extremely generous with his time in answering newbie questions. Although I found it difficult to follow and implement all his trades in real time, what I did find was that once you got the hang of his methodology and way of thinking, you could work out your own trades and be quite successful. Even just using his patent Rule Number One* alone is worth its weight in gold. Rule Number Two is even better. Rookie IRA Investor

Phil… My portfolio, in the past few months, has acheived a high degree of stabilization. I've noticed that on up days, down days, even days, it doesn't matter, my portfolio rarely varies more than 2%. And over the long haul it just slowly increases in value. I attribute this not to investment choices, but to style. Thanks to you and others on this site I'm paying close attention to position size, delta neutrality, downside protection, and concentrating on selling premium rather than buying it. I've developed increasing patience, not having to trade daily, or even weekly. I'm concentrating on the finer points of trading, letting the profits come to me, rather than the other way around. I appreciate the help everyone here has given in getting me focused on this principle. I'm pumped!…in a calm sort of way. Iflantheman

USO, QQQ- Phil, thanks for these plays. Out of USO for about 65% gain today and just keeping 1/4 QQQ. Ksone88

Phil is a master at keeping you laughing, as well as making you money. - It is like "" laughing all the way to the bank!"" Gel1

I doubled down on our USO June $35 puts on Tuesday afternoon and listened to your posting yesterday and sold 1/2 midday and the rest I sold (luckily) at the top of the market yesterday with the last 1/4 of my contracts at 100% return in less than one day! Samlawyer

You guys gotta give it to phil–the voice of reason yesterday, last nite and this morning. Corleone

Phil Thank you very much, I appreciate your help and wisdom. CdsdpDean

Brilliant covering of the arcane, the profane , but never the mundane! Easy to understand the reason for your huge following, Phil, and why you have become a must read on my daily agenda. Please accept my complete appreciation. Seeking Truth

What a great post today, Phil. A veritable feast of ideas! I've been reading your posts for years and have modeled my whole trading style after yours. You should be taking 2 and 20 off of me at this point ???? Jablams

I don't post much, but I guess this morning has brought me out. This site has made me tens of thousands, every year since I have become a member. It took me nearly two years devoting 3 hours per day to get on the ball, and actually understand portion sizing, and which trades fit my personal trading style. Before that I spent at least two years working on Buffet style fundamental investing. (Intellegent Investor, Security Analysis, ect.). This site really will teach you amazing things if you just pay attention. Literally it has changed my day to day life, has allowed my family and I to move back to the U.S. from overseas with confidence even with a paycut at my day job, and literally put me in a different league financially. Seriously my life and my children's is better because of this site. Knightpilot

I have been here for 8 yrs, and find it the best service out there. There are more eyes on the market in this forum than anywhere, and opinions abound. So, relax, and let the group help you out. Pharmboy

Phil I must say that it was really nice to have a portfolio that was looking very stable in the face of a rough day for the markets. I ended the day up 0.3% which includes another successful day of futures trading. So with a portfolio of mostly cash, a few of our faves like Apple and LL, JO, TOL, DIS, etc., along with a couple of hedges that paid off nicely today, and my futures trades, I never had to break a sweat during that madhouse today. Yes, by George (or Phil), I may be learning this system! Craig

Phil Killed it tonight trading copper. Anyone who jumped in right after election is up about 75k on one contract! Thanks Kapella

Phil, did you by chance publish the weekly webinar on Youtube yet? I have been watching these and they are awesome. Unfortunately, I can't cut out of work to attend live webinars. Again, they are just awesome content – thank you. jcpdx

Phil - Thanks for the welcoming gift of the POT at a buck Just paid for this month and my membership is not even 24 hours old! looking forward to many more - bk Bjkeck

I have been a member of Phil's site for three years and counting, and my advice is that all investing takes time. There are o shortcuts, no secret way to riches. Same with Phil's site- you need time and patience to start benefitting fully from his advice. But it is often spot on and also very useful, especially to me as I try to keep a level head in this turbulent stock market environment. Jordan

Phil/Everyone here/Thank you - What everyone here with their insightful comments (including yourself) has helped me with is that I'm greatly increasing my ability to trade more psychologically neutral, although I've got a ways to go. Two years ago I'd wake up early and my heart would race if futures weren't pointing exactly how I wanted… I've noticed an exponential leap in my discipline skills especially over this past two weeks. The old me would have ran with that trade for profits without even asking. Now I know that there are ALWAYS more trades and that I have PLENTY of options to turn a bad trade even. Also, it's more logical and less emotionally draining which lets me focus my faculties on my wife, college, my job, and studying for the ol' Series 7. Would it be safe to say that one of the most important skills to develop is the ability to adjust? I'd love to get to the point where I can look at a bracket and know, for example, what I need to sell for cover in what month in order to get my desired results. Both COF and my past DMM venture have been excellent learning experiences. Thanks, everyone. I look forward to further lessons. Skasiah

Bought some QQQ's today on the dip. Added a little bit more to my son's account. Up about 8% in 2 months! I think I've learned some stuff here. Thanks to all that contribute, and of course to the boss. Thanks Phil! JeffDoc

Being on this board is better than successfully completing the Times crossword. Phil's panoply of comments manage to excite, illuminate, frustrate, exasperate, confuse, enlighten, outrage, invigorate and stupefy (and that's par for the morning session only!). But goddammit, it's addictive, informative and when it all goes right extremely profitable. Winston

AMZN ... thanks Phil; boy did they run a squeeze on everyone there ... made me sweat ... scaling helped! I think AMZN has an 85 handle tomorrow ... maybe lower. Cap

I like the retirement picks too. The futures trading is certainly more sexy, but the boring retirement picks are the ones that consistently make me money. jjennings

Phil – great calls this past week, esp. friday and monday. in the old days I would have let Prechter et al scare me into trimming my longs and going short at just the wrong time. your feel for the markets is Tiger-esque. CHK, HOV, BX, TLT and XLF are big winners for me today. My biggest up day in a long time. Thanks! Terrapin22

Phil, I wanted to thank you for all of your teaching, advice, and guidance. Because of you I don't chase, don't worry about missed chances, and play things much more selectively. Yesterday's /ES and /TF and today /CL are my first futures plays of the month. Thanks Phil. (Out of /TF and /ES yesterday with a nice gain) Japarikh

I've recently done exactly what Phil described. I upgraded my ability to trade the IRA acct. by transferring acct. from TDA to TOS. TDA would not allow spreads; TOS does. Neither will allow naked options. With spreads I am able to buy calls or puts several months out then sell front month calls or puts over and over. This allows me to collect premium, which is, of course, the goal. This wasn't an original idea. Phil put me onto it. Since the transfer I've substantially increased my performance in the IRA!

I have been here a year, and made most of my money back from the 14K fall. The people here are more than willing to help whe Phil cannot get to it. FWIW - This site is my brokerage firm, I was with Wells Fargo Portfolio and it was costing a fortune to trade, the costs here are more than offset with the data, trade ideas and profits you should make.. and I get a chuckle out of Cap and Phil's rantings on healtcare, guns, oh, yeah, and government…. Pharmboy

Phil - I celebrate today, having reached my goal for the year, trading in sync with your education and guidance, of 1 million in profit. I learned a lot, achieved much, and am profoundly grateful. To be honest, when I set the goal I thought it was daunting, as I have for many years been an investor in equities but did very little with options. Learning and doing has for me been a blast! I reached my goal by following Phil's strategies - lots of Buy/Writes, covered calls on equities , naked put entries for income production. I did it with 2.5 mil and kept 600,000 in cash in case I got in trouble. I concentrated on stocks (many of my own choosing) that had decent dividends and wrote front month calls against (OTM) which has worked well in this market run. 25% of my gain is in dividends and premium selling, with the balance in appreciation.

Greetings Phil, I am an Economist at Harvard and some of my colleagues and I would like to let you know that we follow your posts on SA, and find your analysis refreshing, rigorous, and acute. Great work! Though many of us (including myself) have our work covered in the Wall St Journal, in many ways your macro commentary is more fearless and accurate than what is generally found in that venerable publication. Kind regards, Daniel Daniel

We are lucky to be in America and it is great to be part of the PSW tribe. Keeps me thinkin' and gatherin' the profits. ~ 42 % gain in my trading account year to date, which keeps me happy. Half to a third of the trading account is reserved in margin capacity that Is not committed. So, again thanks Phil and all of you other members. Newthugger

On Optrader's section yesterday he was asked how he works with AAPL as an investment. He replied that he just ‘plays with the covers'. I've got a separate portfolio where I use primarily this technique over the past 6 months. Up 60% The principles involved are stock selection, patience, patience, using covers to protect profits, rolling covers to maximize premium return, and exiting when covers are gone and stock price is high. Sometimes it's hard to remember where you learn to do this stuff, but much of it is from integrating principles I've learned here with thing I already knew. Thanks for the help on this, Phil and others. Iflantheman"
