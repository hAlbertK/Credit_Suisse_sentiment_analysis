REUTERS/Ammar AwadJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian driver they said had carried out a car-ramming attack on Friday that injured two Israeli civilians in the occupied West Bank, one of them critically. Reuters journalists at the scene saw police rolling the body of the driver into a plastic sheet. Palestinian health authorities identified him as a Palestinian national. An Israeli police spokesman said an officer who had been near the scene opened fire after the attacker rammed his car into people by the roadside near the Israeli settlement of Elazar, close to the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service said one of the Israelis, 17, was unresponsive and “in severe condition with multisystem trauma” and that the other, 19, had sustained moderate injuries.  Dozens of Israeli troops and medics were at the scene. The alleged attacker’s vehicle, which bore Israeli license plates which allow greater freedom of movement in both Israel and the West Bank, was overturned by the roadside. Police said the attacker had been driving along a road which weaves past Palestinian towns and Israeli settlements.  Palestinians carried out a wave of car-rammings in the West Bank in late 2015 and 2016, but the frequency of such incidents has since ebbed.  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

ADOM,"MISHMERET, Israel (Reuters) - A long-range rocket launched from the Gaza Strip struck a house in central Israel on Monday, wounding six people in the first such incident since a 2014 war in the Palestinian enclave, Israeli authorities said.  Israeli policemen and soldiers inspect a damaged house that was hit by a rocket north of Tel Aviv Israel March 25, 2019. REUTERS/ Ammar AwadThe early morning attack on Mishmeret, an agricultural town north of Tel Aviv, came at a time of high tension ahead of the anniversary of Gaza border protests at the weekend, and with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visiting Washington as he campaigns for a fifth term in an April 9 ballot.  Israel’s commercial capital and outlying communities had last come under such an attack during the 2014 war with Gaza’s dominant Hamas Islamists.  The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating six occupants of a home in Mishmeret, including an infant, for  wounds. TV images showed a building with extensive damage, and police said it had also been set aflame. The strike came minutes after the Israeli military activated air raid sirens in the area and said one rocket had been launched out of the Gaza Strip, a coastal territory 50 miles (80 km) away where Hamas and other factions possess such weapons.   Emmanuel Nahshon, spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, said the home in Mishmeret was hit by a rocket from Gaza.  There was no immediate Palestinian confirmation. Two rockets were launched at Tel Aviv on March 14 but caused no casualties or damage, Israel said. It blamed the rocket launches on Hamas, though a security official who declined to be identified by name or nationality later said that the salvo, which missed any built-up areas, had been set off by accident. There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu on Monday’s incident. His chief rival in next month’s election, centrist ex-general Benny Gantz, issued a statement accusing the rightist premier of having “bankrupted national security”.

ADOM,"DEIR IBZI’, West Bank (Reuters) - An Israeli teenager was killed and her father and brother were injured by a Palestinian bomb near a settlement in the occupied West Bank on Friday, Israeli officials said. Israeli forces gather at the scene of an attack near the Jewish settlement of Dolev in the Israeli-occupied West Bank August 23, 2019. REUTERS/Ammar AwadThe family were visiting a spring in a popular hiking area when an improvised explosive device (IED) blew up, the Israeli military and paramedics said. The military said it was being treated as a terrorist attack. It was not immediately clear if the device had been planted in advance or thrown. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service confirmed that 17-year-old Rina Shnerb had died at the scene and said her father and brother - named by Israeli media as Rabbi David Eitan, 46, and 21-year-old Dvir - were in serious condition. A large crowd of mourners gathered later on Friday for the teenager’s funeral in her home town of Lod, where her body was covered in a white shroud adorned with the Star of David. “This is insane, everything that’s happening here. I still can’t believe it,” said Shnerb’s sister Tamar. “Only yesterday you were here, joyful as always, you were happy and made everyone happy, as you always do.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to the family, and said security forces were pursuing the attackers. “The long arm of Israel reaches all those who seek our lives,” Netanyahu said in a statement, adding: “We will continue to strengthen settlement. We will deepen our roots and strike at our enemies.” The hilly central region of the West Bank around the settlement of Dolev lies northwest of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, and is studded with olive groves and orchards. The area saw clashes last year between Palestinians and Israelis, as Palestinian villagers complained that settlers were trying to take over land, including water sources. On Friday morning, the Israeli military quickly cordoned off the area around the Ein Bobin spring near the Palestinian village of Deir Ibzi’ while soldiers set up checkpoints on roads and searched the area. An Israeli student, Danny Gonen, was killed at the same spring in 2015 in an attack claimed by a group that said it was affiliated with the Islamist group Hamas. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised the latest attack but did not claim responsibility for it, warning Israel not to “assault our Jerusalem and our sacred sites”. In a speech in Gaza he said: “I bless this operation and I greet the hands of those who executed it. I pray for God to protect those who stood behind it. Regardless of who they are, they are Palestinians.” David Friedman, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, tweeted that he was “heartbroken and outraged”. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Jason Greenblatt, urged the Palestinian Authority to “unequivocally condemn” the attack.

ADOM,"GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel launched air strikes on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza  and deployed extra troops to the border on Monday in response to the longest-range Hamas rocket attack to cause casualties in years. After a day of intense cross-border fighting, Palestinian officials said Egypt had mediated a ceasefire, though the frontier did not remain calm for long. Rocket sirens sounded in southern Israel after the late-night truce was supposed to take effect, sending residents running for shelter. In Gaza, Palestinians reported Israeli planes attacked at least two targets.  Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, and smaller Palestinian factions put out a statement that Egypt had mediated a ceasefire even as the rockets were fired. Israeli officials did not comment on whether a truce had been reached. Monday’s violence began when seven Israelis were wounded near Tel Aviv by a morning rocket attack. The Gaza health ministry said five Palestinians were later wounded by a wave of retaliatory strikes. Dozens of explosions rocked the coastal enclave and ambulance sirens echoed in the mostly empty streets. In one Gaza neighborhood, people rushed to buy bread in anticipation of a long escalation. The office of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was one of the initial targets hit, although he was likely to have been evacuated in advance. Gaza militants fired barrages of rockets into Israel late into the night. Some were shot down by Israeli defenses and others landed in empty areas. The escalation came just two weeks before an election in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his political life after a decade in power, campaigning on a tough line against Palestinian militants. Beset by corruption scandals, he faces a strong challenge from a centrist coalition led by a top general.

Israel has waged three wars on Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. Israeli air strikes in retaliation for rockets from Gaza are a frequent occurrence, but Israel’s swift mobilization of extra troops to the border area was unusual.

The Israeli military said it was assigning two brigades to the Gaza area and some reservists were being called up. Reuters journalists saw troops moving toward the border, where the military also closed several roads to civilian traffic. “We are prepared for a wide range of scenarios,” chief spokesman Ronen Manelis said. Israeli towns near Gaza and Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial capital, opened bomb shelters in anticipation of rocket strikes. The rocket attack coincided with tension ahead of the March 30 anniversary of the start of weekly Gaza protests at the frontier in which some 200 Gazans have been killed and thousands wounded by Israeli fire. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Israel says it has no choice but to use deadly force at the protests to prevent militants from breaching the border fence.

ADOM,"GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Gaza militants fired more than 250 rockets into Israeli towns and villages through Saturday, while Israel hit back with tank shelling and air strikes that Palestinian officials said killed four people. A ball of fire is seen during an Israeli air strike in Gaza City May 4, 2019. REUTERS/Suhaib SalemCross-border hostilities which broke out on Friday flared into a second day, with Palestinians fleeing Israeli strikes in Gaza and air-raid sirens sending Israelis running to shelters as interceptor missiles blew up rockets in the sky.     The escalation, which comes just ahead of both the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Israel’s Independence Day holiday, prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to convene  security chiefs.  Egyptian mediators, credited with brokering ceasefires in previous rounds of violence, were working to prevent further hostilities. The latest round of violence began on Friday when a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers, according to the Israeli military.  Israel retaliated with an air strike that killed two militants from the armed Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Two other Palestinians protesting near the frontier were killed by Israeli forces on the same day, Palestinian officials said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad began firing waves of rockets into Israel early on Saturday. The Israeli military said its tanks and aircraft responded with strikes against more than 120 militant targets belonging to both groups. Explosions shook Gaza City, where busy streets were packed with shoppers preparing for Ramadan. The Gaza Health Ministry said a 14-month old baby, her pregnant mother and another man were killed by Israeli strikes and at least 20 other Palestinians were wounded. Residents identified two of them as militants.      “The Israeli plane fired a missile near the house and the shrapnel entered the house and hit the poor baby,” said her aunt, Ibtessam Abu Arar.  The Israeli military Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, questioned whether the baby was killed in an air strike.  “According to indications, the infant and her mother were killed as a result of Palestinian terrorist activities and not as a result of an Israeli raid,” he said on Twitter, without providing further details.  Two multi-storey buildings in Gaza City were destroyed by Israeli raids. One, the Israeli military said, housed Hamas’s intelligence and security offices. The other housed Islamic Jihad facilities, Palestinian sources said.  Witnesses said the Israeli military had warned people inside to evacuate the buildings before they were bombed. One of them  also housed the office of the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency. Ankara condemned the strike.       A small armed pro-Hamas group in Gaza, the Protectors of Al-Aqsa, said one of its men was killed in another air strike.  Related CoverageTurkey calls international community to act on 'disproportionate actions' by IsraelThe Magen David Adom ambulance service said two Israelis were wounded by shrapnel.  TRUCE EFFORTS Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said Israel was prepared to intensify its attacks. He added that Islamic Jihad was trying to destabilize the border and blamed Hamas for failing to rein it in.  Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the rocket barrages were a response to Friday’s events and that Israel has been delaying the implementation of previous understandings brokered by Cairo. In a joint statement, Hamas and Islamic Jihad said: “Our response will be broader and more painful if the enemy pursues its aggression.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli actions in Gaza. Hamas said on Thursday that its Gaza chief, Yeyha Sinwar, had traveled to Cairo for talks on efforts to maintain calm along the border and alleviate hardship in the enclave.  “Egypt has stepped up its efforts with Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and Israel, but there is no conclusion yet,” said a Palestinian official familiar with Cairo’s mediation efforts.  The United Nations has also been part of the Cairo talks.  “The United Nations is working with Egypt and all sides to calm the situation,” said U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov. “This endless cycle of violence must end and efforts must accelerate to realize a political solution to the crisis in Gaza.” “The United States strongly condemns the ongoing barrage of rocket attacks by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Saturday.   Although aerial exchanges are frequent, Israel and Hamas have managed to avert all-out war for the past five years.  Israel is due to host the 2019 Eurovision song contest finals in less than two weeks in Tel Aviv, towards which long-range rockets were launched in mid-March.     Some 2 million Palestinians live in Gaza, whose economy has suffered years of blockades as well as recent foreign aid cuts. Unemployment stands at 52 percent, according to the World Bank, and poverty is rampant. Israel says its blockade is necessary to stop weapons reaching Hamas, with which it has fought three wars since the group seized control of Gaza in 2007. Slideshow (14 Images)Over the past few weeks, Cairo’s mediation had helped persuade Israel to lift some restrictions on the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza and expand the Mediterranean zone where Gazans can fish.

Israeli media reports said the assailant was shot by a fellow resident of the Adam settlement, which lies between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah. There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials.   Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Palestinian Gaza Strip, praised the attack. Its spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, said it was a “heroic and brave operation that came in response to the daily, ugly crimes conducted by the Israeli occupation against our people.” Israeli-Palestinian tensions have surged in the past few months.  At least 140 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli fire in weekly border demonstrations. Israel says Hamas is using the protests as cover for a cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this. Palestinian militants have in recent weeks fired hundreds of rockets into Israel from Gaza and have opened fire at Israeli troops across the border, killing one soldier and drawing fatal Israeli air and tank strikes.     Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by the U.S. administration to restart them has so far shown little sign of progress. Palestinians want to establish a state in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005, annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and maintains control over more than half the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule. Most countries consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal. Israel disputes this.

AMR,"* Seeks to end coverage for retirees over 65 * Retirees under 65 would pay for AMR’s health plan By Nick Brown NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - The parent company of bankrupt American Airlines has sought court permission to reduce retiree health benefits and add out-of-pocket costs for access to certain coverage. Bruce Hicks, a company spokesman, said on Friday that AMR Corp would discontinue retiree life insurance and would end medical coverage for those over 65. That group would, instead, have access to a Medicare supplement at their own cost. Retirees under 65 would still have access to company plans, but at their own expense as well, Hicks said. AMR asked a New York bankruptcy judge to declare that it has the right to alter company-funded retiree benefits because they were never vested. American’s retiree health plans cover more than 40,000 people. In the filing, American argued that it would be required to maintain company-provided benefits only if it had promised to provide those benefits for life. AMR made no such promises, and explicitly reserved its right to modify its retiree benefit plans, it said. “The restructuring process is difficult for everyone affected, and we understand any changes to these benefits are concerning to our retirees,” Hicks said. A lawyer for a committee of retired workers did not respond to requests for comment. Other U.S. airlines reduced retiree health plans while in bankruptcy and eliminated or changed pension plans as well to save money. American sought bankruptcy protection in November, citing high labor costs. AMR has said it must save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in labor costs, and has sought to achieve those savings through concessions from workers, including unionized pilots, flight attendants and ground workers. Unions, livid over those demands, are supporting an effort by US Airways to merge with AMR, a prospect the unions say could salvage some jobs and benefits. AMR said it had $1.25 billion in retiree health and welfare liability as of 2010. The proposed cuts to retiree benefits are very similar to previously proposed changes that would affect current workers who retire in the future.

AMR,"(Reuters) - AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, on Wednesday proposed a plan to freeze pensions covering many of its workers, retreating from an earlier proposal to terminate them and leave them to government insurers, which could result in lower payouts. A worker walks underneath an American Airlines airplane at Miami International airport in Miami, Florida November 29, 2011.   REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe proposal, which would avert the largest pension default in U.S. history, could move the third-largest U.S. airline a step closer to consensual deals with its major unionized work groups as its struggles to slash uncompetitive labor costs. AMR, which filed for Chapter 11 on November 29, had been the only major airline to avoid bankruptcy in the last decade and is the only one that still has traditional, or defined benefit, pensions, the company said. “Freezing the defined benefit pension plans would mean that employees would retain the full value of benefits accrued for service prior to the date the plan is frozen,” said Jeff Brundage, AMR’s senior vice president of human Resources, in a letter to employees. “Freezing instead of terminating these plans of course would mean we will have significantly larger pension costs than contemplated in our business plan,” Brundage said. AMR has said it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion, including $1.25 billion in labor costs. AMR said it still must achieve the labor savings target and it would seek new capital to cover the incremental annual costs of funding frozen pensions. AMR said in letters to employees that the pension proposal does not extend to its pilots because their plan includes provisions for a costly lump sum payout to retiring workers that other work groups do not have. “Given the number of pilots who are eligible to retire, the company would be at significant operational risk if we emerge from Chapter 11 with a frozen plan that allows pilots to retire with a lump sum benefit,” Brundage said. AMR still wants to terminate the pilots’ plan unless it can get the lump sum matter resolved. The Allied Pilots Association said in a letter to members that it would ask them to waive the lump sum option in the plans that feature it so that those pensions can be frozen as well. “Our plan is the only one on the AMR property that includes the option of a lump sum and our experts have concluded that attempting to preserve a lump-sum option is not achievable,” APA President David Bates said. VICTORY FOR PENSION INSURER AMR said in February that it would seek bankruptcy court approval to terminate traditional pension plans covering 130,000 workers and retirees. Those plans would be replaced with 401(k) plans with a company match. Employer-financed defined benefit plans provide a fixed payout over time and are historically more generous than the 401(k) or other cash plans that mix employee and employer contributions that are more common today. Traditional pensions are often still found in heavily unionized industries such as airlines, autos and aerospace. AMR’s pensions covering pilots, flight attendants and ground workers were underfunded by an estimated $10 billion when the company filed for bankruptcy. Underfunding is the difference between the assets in a plan and the amount of future obligations. United Airlines had the largest pension default in the United States at nearly $9 billion underfunded. The decision is a victory for U.S. pension insurers, who waged a public campaign against plans by American to cancel its pensions in bankruptcy. “Bankruptcy forces tough choices, but that doesn’t mean pensions must be sacrificed for companies to succeed. We will continue to work with American and the other participants in the bankruptcy to ensure that success,” Josh Gotbaum, director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, said in a statement. The agency reported a record deficit of $26 billion in 2011 and is responsible for payouts to 1.5 million people. It paid more than $5 billion in benefits last year. In many cases, retirees get less in benefits when the government takes over the pensions of bankrupt companies. The Transport Workers Union, which represents many of the ground workers at AMR, cheered the plan, saying an earlier proposal to terminate pensions was “totally unacceptable.” “I have to say that I do consider it a win because terminating is not an option,” TWU President James Little told Reuters. “I think that would have been the most devastating.” He said that while TWU would rather keep its pension plans intact, a freeze is more palatable and advances the union’s goal of reaching a deal with AMR. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants said on its website that it has not responded to AMR’s proposal and that it was “meeting internally to evaluate the proposal.” American has almost 74,000 full- and part-time employees and its regional carrier American Eagle has about 14,000 full- and part-time employees. The company has been leaning on its labor unions to agree to concessions. Should AMR and its unions be unable to reach consensual deals, AMR could ask the bankruptcy judge to abrogate existing labor deals and allow the company to impose new terms.

AMR,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A bankruptcy judge on Thursday held off approval of a restructuring plan for American Airlines, citing a U.S. government challenge this week to the airline’s proposed merger with US Airways Group Inc LCC.N. A US Airways plane and an American Airlines plane share a terminal at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington April 23, 2012. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueAmerican’s parent company, AMR Corp AAMRQ.PK, worked out the $11 billion merger with US Airways as part of a plan to exit bankruptcy, where it has been since 2011. Judge Sean Lane had been expected to approve the plan at a hearing on Thursday. But, two days before the hearing, the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher fares and hurt consumers. Instead of approving the plan, Lane gave AMR and its creditors until August 23 to submit briefs on how he should proceed. Lane said he needed more information about the appropriateness of approving the restructuring plan in light of the antitrust challenge. AMR and US Airways, which have said they will fight the antitrust lawsuit, and their lawyers argued on Thursday that Lane should still approve the bankruptcy plan. A lawyer for US Airways, Daniel Wall, said the Justice Department’s timing, just two days before the final hearing, was “audacious.” “Don’t allow the bankruptcy issues, which are complicated enough on their own, to be held hostage to very late-filed antitrust issues,” Wall told the judge. But Lane cited “lingering doubts” about the benefits of approving a bankruptcy plan before the antitrust issue is resolved. “What would be the point of entering a confirmation order ... if, in fact, there’s a lot more work to be done?” he said. Under the restructuring plan, a reorganization cannot go ahead without antitrust approval for the merger, which could take months. If the Justice Department ultimately succeeds in blocking the merger, it would put AMR’s restructuring back at square one, requiring it to forge new strategies for paying back creditors. AMR shareholders, who stand to receive a 3.5 percent stake in the new entity under the merger, would likely be wiped out under any plan that excludes a merger, restructuring experts have said. Lane said he had strongly considered canceling Thursday’s hearing but decided to give parties an open forum to discuss the antitrust challenge. The bankruptcy plan has the support of nearly all of AMR’s key creditors, and Lane had already signed off on the merger and an initial outline of the restructuring plan that incorporates it. Absent the antitrust challenge, Thursday’s hearing would have been the final step in AMR’s exiting bankruptcy and implementing its merger.

AMR,"Feb 24 (Reuters) - AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, needs concessions from its labor groups in a matter of weeks, not months, in order to emerge from Chapter 11 in the near term, the company said on Friday. In a strongly worded labor negotiations update, the third-largest U.S. airline said it must make major changes to its contracts and that it does have the “luxury of time.” “As the company laid out in its February 1 restructuring announcement, we must make major changes to our labor agreements. And we need those changes in a matter of weeks,” the carrier said. AMR filed for Chapter 11 protection on Nov. 29, citing uncompetitive labor costs after years of fruitless talks with its unions. The carrier says it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion. The carrier dismissed requests for buyouts from unions representing its flight attendants and many ground workers, saying the proposals “represent a significant cost to the company and could not be accepted on their terms.” Unlike its top rivals United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, AMR did not restructure in bankruptcy in the last 10 years. Instead, it reorganized out of court, relying on its workers for voluntary concessions. United and Delta, however, emerged stronger from bankruptcy, later found merger partners and leapfrogged AMR in size. Those airlines are profitable now while AMR is not. AMR posted a net loss of net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. The president of the Transport Workers Union told Reuters in an interview this month that it will offer alternatives to some of the job cuts and concessions the company says it needs to survive and that the union needs more details on how AMR arrived at its cost-savings targets. AMR said in its update late on Friday it still hopes to reach consensual deals with its labor groups, rather than have terms imposed on them by the court.

AMR,"* Creditor had sought probe into pre-bankruptcy transactions * Sides resolve dispute, preserve potential legal claims * AMR can keep control of bankruptcy through Jan. 28 By Nick Brown NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Marathon Asset Management has withdrawn a request for an independent investigator to examine the books of American Airlines, a unit of bankrupt AMR Corp, lawyers for the companies said at a hearing on Thursday. The move came after AMR agreed to preserve potential clawback claims relating to debt deals, struck between Marathon and AMR, that left American Airlines with $2.26 billion of debt. AMR entered bankruptcy last November, and is considering its options for emerging either as a standalone firm or to merge with smaller competitor US Airways Group, which is making an aggressive takeover push. Marathon, which has said it holds “well over” $100 million of AMR debt, last month sought an examiner to probe intercompany transactions consummated in the weeks before AMR’s Chapter 11 filing. The deals transferred about $2.26 billion of debt from AMR’s American Eagle unit to American Airlines. Marathon said in court papers it was concerned that potential legal claims to claw the money back would be barred under the language of a separate settlement, under which AMR refinanced about 200 of its aircraft. AMR dismissed that argument in court filings as an “obvious litigation tactic.” But on Thursday, it agreed to expressly preserve such claims in exchange for Marathon dropping its request for an examiner, AMR attorney Richard Hahn said at the hearing in federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y.. The resolution also allows AMR to move forward with the underlying aircraft refinancing deal, which it says will save about $670 million on planes manufactured by Embraer. Marathon has been taking a more vocal role in AMR’s bankruptcy, adding another layer of complexity to the already multi-faceted case. The examiner request was Marathon’s second attempt to flex its muscles as a significant creditor, coming days after it sent a letter to AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton demanding more transparency about the airline’s restructuring efforts. It remains unclear whether Marathon supports a standalone restructuring or a US Airways merger, or whether Marathon would be in a position to finance an independent exit from bankruptcy for AMR. But as a large debtholder, the hedge fund could be in a position to influence either scenario by objecting to plans it does not support. US Airways would like to acquire AMR out of bankruptcy, while a group of debtholders including JPMorgan Chase & Co  has expressed interest in financing a standalone exit. AMR received court permission at Thursday’s hearing to extend for 30 days, through Jan. 28, its unilateral control of its bankruptcy exit plan. That means US Airways cannot propose its own takeover plan until that date, and that any merger plan before that date would have to be a cooperative effort with AMR. Labor issues will also affect AMR’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy independently. High labor costs were a driving force in the company’s bankruptcy filing, and while the airline has reached new collective bargaining deals with its flight attendants’ and ground workers’ unions, it remains at odds with its pilots. That could spook investors assessing the company’s stability going forward, and AMR’s creditors’ committee has said labor peace with pilots is a top priority. While AMR and its pilots continue to negotiate, the pilots have said they support a merger with US Airways. They have also said they already have a tentative labor deal in place with US Airways.

AMR,"* TWU wants to haggle over AMR cost cuts * Union says it wants to propose alternatives * Says awaits financial details from AMR By Kyle Peterson Feb 14 (Reuters) - The union representing seven categories of ground workers at bankrupt American Airlines will offer alternatives to some of the job cuts and concessions the company says it needs to survive, the head of the Transport Workers Union said on Tuesday. TWU has asked American’s parent company AMR Corp  for details on how it arrived at the cost-savings targets it unveiled this month when it said it planned to eliminate 13,000 jobs and terminate pensions. Union president James Little told Reuters in an interview the union hopes to draw on the labor deals it struck with the company prior to the Nov. 29 bankruptcy filing to salvage some of those jobs. “It’s irresponsible for us to take those numbers for granted and not do our own analysis,” Little said. AMR said it was aiming for $2 billion in total annual cost reductions, including $1.25 billion in employee-related expenses. American, the third-largest U.S. airline, said it may eliminate 13,000 jobs as part of its restructuring. About 9,000 of those workers are members of the TWU, which had already negotiated contracts or tentative labor deals for four of the seven work groups it represents at AMR when the company filed for Chapter 11. Little said the TWU is waiting for financial information from the company so it can either challenge the cost-savings targets or suggest alternatives to help AMR reach its targets in a way that makes the cuts more palatable to its members. “We would like to reach a consensual agreement,” Little said, adding that he expected other labor unions also to offer alternatives to the AMR’s plan. The airline has presented non-public details of its restructuring plan to members of its creditors committee. Labor unions representing pilots, flight attendants and groundworkers, have three of the nine seats AMR presented to creditors. Any reorganization plan would require approval from AMR’s bankruptcy court judge. AMR restructured out of court nearly 10 years ago, while several of its rivals like United Airlines and Delta Air Lines slashed costs with Chapter 11 protection. Those two airlines emerged from Chapter 11 stronger, went on to find merger partners and now earn profits while AMR posts losses. AMR, meanwhile, relied on voluntary concessions during its last reorganization but now complains its labor costs are higher than its competitors. American said it lost $10 billion over the past decade and financed the red ink with debt. The period was marked mainly by industry downturns triggered by the 2001 hijack attacks, recession, and skyrocketing fuel prices. American has about 73,800 full and part-time employees and its regional carrier American Eagle has 14,200 full- and part-time employees.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Labor union to suggest alternatives to AMR cost cuts

AMR,"(Reuters) - AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, said on Tuesday it eliminated five senior jobs as part of its restructuring and that its lead labor strategist would step down. An American Airlines plane sits at its gate while another taxis for departure at O'Hare International airport in Chicago November 29, 2011. AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, said on Tuesday it eliminated five senior jobs as part of its restructuring and that its lead labor strategist would step down. REUTERS/Frank PolichThe cuts, combined with the previously announced departure of other managers, represents a “20 percent reduction in the company’s most senior leadership positions,” AMR said in a statement. An AMR spokeswoman said eight or nine management jobs had been cut so far. AMR filed for bankruptcy in November, citing a need to slash uncompetitive costs. The company has said it intends to cut its overall costs by $2 billion a year. More than half of that amount will come from labor costs. “Redesigning the organization will help accelerate our progress toward profitability and success,” said AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton in a letter to employees. “Every step increases our clarity of purpose and helps speed decisions in the interest of best serving our customers.” Among the five departing executives are David Brooks, American’s President - Cargo, and Susan Garcia, American’s Vice President - Information Technology. In the same statement, AMR said Jeff Brundage, who is AMR’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources, has been replaced in his role by Denise Lynn, who will carry the job title Senior Vice President - People. The company did not say why Brundage was replaced. He will not immediately leave the company. “For now, I’m not going anywhere and will continue to work with many of you on the needed changes,” he said. Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former AMR executive, said Brundage’s departure is ironic amid the ongoing labor clash between AMR and its management. As AMR overhauls its management team, the airline is battling its unions in court over its request to void their labor contracts if workers do not willingly make the concessions the company says it needs to survive. American has been locked for years in fruitless negotiations with its three labor unions, which represent pilots, flight attendants and several classifications of ground workers. The airline won steep concessions from labor in 2003 as it dodged bankruptcy at the time. The carrier has about 74,000 full- and part-time workers. The company has said it must cut 13,000 union jobs. Against this backdrop, rival airline US Airways Group is hoping to jumpstart merger talks with AMR, which so far has shrugged off the interest. To further that goal, US Airways last month struck deals with AMR’s unions, which say US Airway’s plan save more jobs than AMR could through its stand-alone plan. The unions each have seats on AMR’s creditors committee, meaning they have a say in how AMR exits bankruptcy. For now, however, the carrier has the exclusive right under bankruptcy law to reorganize without interference from outsiders. The airline says it still hopes to reach consensual deals with its workers. AMR has presented what it calls its last and best offer to the Transport Workers Union, which represents 26,000 workers in seven work groups American Airlines. A TWU spokesman on Tuesday said information on AMR’s offer will be sent by mail to members this week with voting set to begin next week. American Airlines is the third-largest U.S. airline. It had been the only major U.S. airline to avoid Chapter 11 in the last decade, a factor that gave rivals a cost advantage.

FRED,"OSLO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The biggest shareholder in Fred. Olsen Energy on Thursday proposed changing the company’s name, days after it blamed the latest oil price plunge for the collapse of a rig sale deal to raise money to cut debts. The company, controlled by one of Norway’s richest families, the Olsens, has been trying to restructure debts of about $580 million and the refinancing plan included the sale of its newest rig Bolette Dolphin. But the plan to sell Bolette Dolphin for $340 million failed after a buyer pulled out of the talks, the company said on Tuesday. “The potential buyer of the Bolette Dolphin has withdrawn from the sales process given the significant change in oil and equity prices coupled with the uncertainty around the restructuring and sale process,” Fred. Olsen said at the time. Oil services companies like Fred. Olsen have borne the brunt of a downturn in the oil industry where oil companies had to cut spending to cope with a fall in oil prices. An oversupply of oil rigs added to the oil services industry’s pain by lowering day rates for rig hire. A number of Fred. Olsen’s rivals have been forced out of business or had to restructure. The oil price has since recovered, with North Sea oil hitting a four-year high of $86 per barrel in October, boosting rig owners’ hopes that oil companies will start spending again to replenish reserves. But in less than two months, oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel on concerns about a supply glut. The price drop also comes at the time of year when oil companies usually plan next year’s budgets. Rival drilling rig firm Seadrill , which emerged from U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July, has downplayed the impact of the recent oil market plunge. “The recent volatility in oil crisis has little bearing on how the vast majority of our customers invest. Their time horizon is much longer,” Seadrill Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz said during an earnings call on Tuesday.” Both Seadrill and Fred. Olsen Energy said in their outlooks that a broad rig market recovery has been taking place, and prices should rise next year. On Thursday, Fred. Olsen called an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Dec. 20 to approve a proposal to change its name to Dolphin Drilling, the name associated with large finds on the Norwegian continental shelf, including the country’s largest gas field Troll. The proposal came from its major shareholder Bonheur , an investment company of the Olsen family, which also has investments in renewable energy, cruise shipping, and media. The company was not immediately available to comment on the reason for the proposed name change. Fred. Olsen Energy also owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that built the RMS Titanic.

FRED,"OSLO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred.

The proposal includes issuing about $90 million in new loan capital, paying $580 million to settle outstanding secured debt, and converting bond debt into equity. Existing shares of the company will represent approximately one percent of the share capital after the restructuring. The shares, which have fallen 99 percent over the last five years, closed down 25 percent. Last month, Fred. Olsen (FOE) said it was edging closer to a deal to solve the company’s financial situation, and warned that the deal could require new equity, amendments to the company’s bank and bond facilities, and sale of assets. The refinancing plan calls for the company to sell its Bolette Dolphin drilling unit. Fred. Olsen owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that build the RMS Titanic. “FOE will continue its discussions with its key stakeholders with the aim of securing the necessary support for its implementation, and note that the proposal remains subject to change following such discussions,” the company said. “Following such refinancing, Fred Olsen will continue as a four drilling unit company (including Blackford Dolphin, Bideford Dolphin, Borgland Dolphin and Byford Dolphin),” it added.

FRED,"OSLO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred. Olsen Energy, owner of the yard that built the RMS Titanic, is considering a debt and equity restructuring that would almost wipe out the value of its current shares, the company said. With debt and liabilities of more than $840 million at the end of June, Fred. Olsen last month stopped paying its creditors to preserve liquidity, making it the latest victim of a slow recovery in the oil and gas exploration sector. The owner of seven drillships and rigs, as well as Belfast’s Harland & Wolff yard, has now received indicative, non-binding proposals from equity investors valuing its current shares and bonds at just $10 million, it said in a statement.

Olsen’s shares traded 15.9 percent lower in Oslo at 5.70 Norwegian crowns by 0804 GMT. The company has a 1.025 billion Norwegian crown ($124.63 million) bond maturing in February 2019, while bank debt of $611 million falls due the following year. “The deal implies conversion of bonds to equity and partial conversion of bank debt,” Chief Executive Ivar Brandvold told Reuters. The proposal would also secure an infusion of new equity financing and establish a “solid financial platform” for Fred. Olsen Energy to continue its operations, the firm said, although negotiations were still ongoing and no deadline had been set. Any deal would require approval from holders of the company’s bonds.

FRED,"(Adds share price, analyst quotes, share price) OSLO, July 2 (Reuters) - Creditors in Fred. Olsen Energy have not extended a waiver on the terms of the company’s debt agreements, the Norwegian drilling rig contractor said on Monday, sending its shares as much as 27 percent lower. The company had previously warned it might need new equity and a potential impairment of its bank and bond loans to achieve a long-term solution for its financial problems. A number of offshore rig owners had to restructure their debts, and some went out of business, due to prolonged decline in demand after oil prices plunged in 2014. Prices have partly recovered since hitting a low in January 2016, and demand for drilling rigs, especially in the North Sea, has increased. “I hope they will come to the agreement (with creditors)... The market’s recovery should help that by providing more opportunities to win new contracts,” Fredrik Lunde, head of research at Carnegie, said. Nordic banks DNB, Danske and Nordea hold the bulk of Fred. Olsen Energy’s bank debt. The waiver granted in January expired on June 30, and the financial terms of the debt agreements will be tested on July 20, the company said. Fred. Olsen Energy said it would operate as normal while continuing talks with stakeholders, creditors and their advisers. At the end of 2017, the company had $759 million outstanding under a syndicated bank loan, and a bond loan worth 1 billion crowns ($122 million) maturing in February 2019. During the first quarter, the company made a scheduled payment of about $95.5 million under the bank facility. Fred. Olsen Energy’s fleet consists of three deepwater and four harsh environment mid-water rigs, of which only one is being used - under a short-term contract with BP.

IMI,"(Adds share price, CEO departure, background, details on results) March 1 (Reuters) - UK-based specialised engineering company IMI Plc reported higher full-year profit and revenue on Friday, driven by strong demand for services in the petrochemical industry and the European construction market. The company’s shares were up 4.6 percent at 9.90 pounds. IMI hiked its full-year dividend by 3 percent and said Roy Twite would succeed Mark Selway as the company’s chief executive officer. The company also forecast lower organic revenue in the first half of 2019, hit by slowing demand in the industrial automation sector. On an adjusted basis, IMI’s pretax profit rose 12 percent to 251 million pounds ($332.50 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, while revenue was up 9 percent at 1.91 billion pounds. The company, whose operations in UK account for less than 5 percent of its total sales, expects full-year results to improve in the second half of the year as it benefits from restructuring certain divisions. IMI, which provides services for the energy and infrastructure sector, said it was increasing inventory levels in anticipation of any border controls or delays ahead of Brexit. The FTSE 250 company had flagged in November about difficulties in managing its business due to tariff-related uncertainties.

IMI,"(Adds details, CEO/CFO comments, share reaction) By Steven Scheer TEL AVIV, May 28 (Reuters) - Israeli defence electronics firm Elbit Systems  reported a rise in first-quarter net profit on Tuesday and forecast further improvements in 2019 following its acquisition of IMI Systems. The maker of drones, pilot helmet displays and cyber security systems said it earned $1.54 per diluted share excluding one-time items in the January-March period, up from $1.29 a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.02 billion from $818.5 million. Elbit bought rival IMI Systems, a manufacturer of military systems best known for being an early maker of the Uzi submachine gun, from the government for $500 million in November. It has been merged into Elbit’s land division, making it among the top five companies for land-based systems. Elbit’s shares were up 1.8 percent at midday in Tel Aviv, pushing gains so far in 2019 to 21 percent. “A quarter ago I committed that IMI would be profitable in 2019. It’s already profitable,” Chief Executive Bezhalel Machlis told Reuters. He said that the full impact of IMI’s integration had yet to be reflected, adding: “We will see improvement in the coming quarters.” Chief Financial Officer Joseph Gaspar said IMI is expected to provide more than $500 million of revenues this year, although profit generated would depend on the pace of cost cutting and the number of contracts. IMI has already won a number of contracts since being folded into Elbit, including one with the United States Armed Forces, one in Israel and another in Asia, with more on the way, said Gaspar. Elbit, which has also seen growth in its network and communications business, has said it expects sales this year to exceed $4 billion, versus $3.7 billion in 2018. The company noted that 27 percent of sales stemmed from its U.S. units  but the company was growing in Europe and Asia-Pacific as well. “We see increased defence spending over almost all the world,” Machlis said. Elbit’s order backlog climbed to $9.66 billion at the end of March from $8.05 billion a year earlier. The company declared a dividend of 44 cents per share for the first quarter, the same as the fourth quarter.

IMI,"(Adds CEO, CFO comments from conference, details, share reaction) By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, March 19 (Reuters) - Israeli defence electronics firm Elbit Systems said costs relating to the acquisition of IMI Systems sent its quarterly profit lower, but forecast that the weapons and military technology maker will start to make a profit this year. The maker of drones, pilot helmet displays and cyber security systems said on Tuesday it earned $1.91 per diluted share in the October-December period, down from $2.01 a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.08 billion from $1.0 billion. In November Elbit bought IMI from the government for $500 million. It said expenses related to the deal reached $69.5 million in the quarter. Elbit shares were down 1.7 percent in afternoon trade in Tel Aviv. They are up 8 percent so far this year after a 7 percent drop in 2018. The acquisition will bring many synergies and puts the company in “a different league” of defence players, said CEO Bezhalel Machlis. “Sales in 2019 will be well above $4 billion,” he told an investors’ conference. This compares with $3.7 billion for Elbit in 2018. Elbit said IMI has been merged into its land division which will more than double its annual sales of $500 million and places it among the top five companies for land-based systems. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Gaspar said IMI was in a difficult financial situation when Elbit bought it, lacking cash and access to credit. Elbit provided guarantees to the banks, injected cash to liquidate loans and reached an agreement with IMI’s union to let go a few hundred workers out of about 3,000. “The bottom line is that they now have cash to run the business,” he said. The land division will be profitable in 2019 and within a few years is expected to match profit levels at Elbit, which has gross margins of 28-29 percent and operating margins of 9-10 percent. “Elbit will continue to grow in 2019 in terms of revenue and profit,” Machlis said. Elbit’s order backlog climbed to $9.4 billion at the end of December from $7.6 billion a year earlier. IMI added about $1 billion to the backlog. At IMI only about 14 percent of sales are from exports but this is starting to change. Machlis said the company will report in the coming weeks a new export contract for guided munitions but did not provide details. Elbit declared a dividend of 44 cents per share for the fourth quarter, the same as the third quarter.

SKIS,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Uganda Airlines has taken to the skies once more after almost two decades out of action, but flies into a crowded aviation market in Africa where carriers have the weakest finances and emptiest planes of any region in the world. The state carrier launched commercial flights on Wednesday, its first since it was liquidated in 2001, aiming to take a slice of the East African aviation business that is dominated by Ethiopian Airlines, the continent’s success story. Uganda is the latest African government to pour money into national flag carriers; Tanzania and Senegal are also resurrecting their airlines, while the likes of Rwanda, Ivory Coast and Togo are expanding theirs.  But such efforts have been hampered by high business costs as well as protectionism, which has impeded a continental open-skies agreement - something industry experts say is vital for the success of African carriers in a tough market.  The African market is forecast to grow almost 5% a year over the next two decades in terms of passengers, faster than mature markets, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). However, this is from a low base and most state-owned flag carriers in the region are losing money.  While the global aviation industry is on track to make a profit of $28 billion, African airlines are projected to make combined losses of $100 million this year, IATA said in June. Uganda Airlines, like some of its rivals, aims to attract more domestic travelers to help it buck the gloomy continental trend. Around 2 million passengers per year travel through Entebbe, Uganda’s main airport. Around 70% are Ugandans, said the carrier’s CEO Ephraim Bagenda.  “All those currently travel on foreign airlines,” he told Reuters. “We want part of that cake.”  CLOSED SKIES Last year, it looked like Africa was making progress on an open-skies agreement - the Single African Air Transport Market - to let airlines decide how frequently they fly between cities and which aircraft they use.  A total of 28 countries have signed up, accounting for 75-80% of African air traffic. Uganda is considering signing, Works and Transport Minister Monica Azuba Ntege said.  However, so far only 10 signatories - including Cape Verde, Ghana, Togo, Ethiopia and Nigeria - have begun changing their own laws to implement the deal and open up their markets, said Raphael Kuuchi, Vice President for Africa at IATA. The patchy efforts undermine the agreement and hobble direct connections within Africa, say analysts. Some airlines, including from countries that have signed up, oppose the open-skies deal because they fear bigger competitors. “The most subsidized airlines and the biggest ones are going to take the biggest market share because they (are) able to afford it,” Kenya Airways CEO Sebastian Mikosz told an investor briefing on Tuesday. “They are going to kill the smaller national airlines which are just starting because they will have no way to defend themselves.” Ethiopian Airlines, sub-Saharan Africa’s only successful large state-owned airline, has bucked the regional trend and has been expanding fast, thanks in part to having secured key traffic rights in two ways.  First, it signed bilateral agreements with nearly all African countries in the 1970s, activating them as needed, said Kuuchi. The airline flew to parts of the continent served by few other carriers and leveraged that goodwill to open up markets.  “Governments were willing to give them additional rights, and travel rights, once you give them out, it’s very difficult to retract,” he added. More recently, Ethiopian has been helping other countries launch their own carriers and taking a stake. That has created regional continental hubs in Togo, Malawi and Chad where it can pick up and feed traffic into its main hub in Addis Ababa, cementing its dominance and rivaling Gulf carriers. Now governments are hoarding travel rights to protect their own airlines, so African carriers are struggling to set up hubs vital to winning international travelers, said Girma Wake, former CEO of Ethiopian Airlines. “Instead of flying point-to-point everywhere, if they can collect traffic from the low-traffic areas and bring them to major hubs and carry them from those major hubs, you will be in a better position,” he told Reuters.  HIGH FUEL COSTS, TAXES African aviation accounted for only 2.1% of the global market in 2018, with 92 million passenger journeys flown, and non-African airlines including Emirates and Turkish Airlines account for around 80% of traffic in and out of the continent, IATA said.  African airlines are also struggling to improve load factors - percentage of seats filled - from the world’s lowest regional level of 71% in 2018, compared with 81.2% globally, according to IATA. Emirates builds traffic through its global Dubai hub, an advantage most African airlines don’t have - except Ethiopian Airlines. As well as protectionism, high fuel and taxation hurt African carriers.  In Europe, a passenger can travel 1.5 hours for less than $100 all-inclusive. In Africa, passenger taxes alone range from $40 to $150 per passenger, African Airlines Association Secretary General Abderahmane Berthe told Reuters. “Many governments are levying taxes on aviation and not reinvesting these collected amounts in aviation,” he said.  Governments often see air transport as a luxury that can sustain high taxes, said Air Tanzania managing director Ladislaus Matindi.  Fuel is also taxed heavily and must often be trucked in, an expensive operation. Fuel makes up about a quarter of operating costs globally but reaches 30-40% in Africa, Berthe said. Uganda Airlines, founded by former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, was liquidated in 2001 after years of unprofitability during a push to privatize state firms. Other African state carriers have been crippled by government interference, such as insisting on routes to unprofitable but politically important destinations.

SKIS,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - While smoke from forest fires in Indonesia often simply obscures visibility with a choking haze, parts of Sumatra island recently witnessed blood red skies due to the interaction of sunlight on particles from smoke in the air.   A glowing red sky is seen in Kumpeh District in Muaro Jambi Regency, Indonesia in this still image obtained from a September 21, 2019 social media video. INSTAGRAM @DANI_KHOLIK via REUTERSThe Southeast Asian country has spent months battling fires, often caused by slash-and-burn farming practices, as an El Nino weather pattern exacerbates the annual dry season and helps create a haze across the region. Yunita, a resident who filmed the crimson sky on Saturday, said there had been “strong winds, and the smog was thick. The event lasted from noon until evening, breathing was quite hard on that day”. The event quickly went viral on social media, with one video notching up over 600,000 views on Instagram in three days.  In order for a red sky to occur aerosols must be present in the air, A. R. Ravishankara, a U.S.-based scientist was cited in an article posted on the website of Scientific American. Aerosols are solid or liquid particles suspended in air that can originate from both natural processes and human activity. The natural form can come from forest fires, dust kicked up by sandstorms, sea spray or volcanic eruptions, among other things. Indonesia’s meteorology agency said the sky had turned red in parts of Sumatra due to the “scattering  of sunlight by particles floating in the air, also known as Mie scattering”. The agency said that there had been very thick smoke in the  Muaro Jambi area of Sumatra last weekend with satellite analysis revealing many hot spots. “The smoke from the forest fire was different than other areas experiencing forest fires,” the agency said. The satellite showed some areas appeared brown but Jambi appeared white, indicating the smoke to be very thick,” the agency said, noting the fires were likely from highly flammable peat.     For some Indonesians, it was as mysterious as it was concerning.    “This is the earth not Mars. This is Jambi not outer space....We are humans who need to breathe clean air, not smoke,” said one Twitter user @zunishofiyn.

I haven’t seen Aksel ski with that level of intensity in quite some time, he skied like an animal today. Kjetil and Aksel did something really special today. “Aksel is a legend and will go down as that.” Svindal, who will quit with 80 World Cup podiums to his name, including 36 wins, said he had been determined to go out in spectacular fashion. “I thought it would be the right thing to do to give it a hell of a show,” he said.  “Last year, Kjetil and I did the same thing in the Olympics but I won the gold, so he deserves it today.” Jansrud, who won Super-G gold at the Sochi Olympics, is not exactly a new kid on the block at the age of 33. “Kjetil is nearly as old as I am so he will take over the dad character for sure!” Svindal, who has finally called it a day after persistent knee problems, said. “I think we have a cool team, we work hard on that too. How many days do you get like this every year? This is like one in a thousand, or one in a hundred. “You really have to make it a life worth living as a downhill skier.

She will continue her relationships with her sponsors and is branching out into movies as an executive producer, and she also hinted at a new secret project that is in the works. “I hope that one day they’ll say, ‘Oh, she was a skier a long time ago, but now she’s a successful businesswoman’. Next goal, take over the world, one step at a time,” she said. Though Vonn admitted that she had had a turbulent time of it emotionally since realizing recently that the end of her career was in sight, she chided reporters for not laughing enough at her jokes as she tried to keep the mood light while outlining her future. “I’m a driven person, I’m not going to be sitting on the couch twiddling my thumbs, that would be boring. I need to do something that activates my mind. I can’t activate my body the way I used to, but it’s all about pushing yourself,” she said. Vonn won’t be letting her lack of business experience hold her back, either. “I went to Harvard for four days, so I feel like I know something!” she said with a broad grin. The three-time Olympic medalist revealed that she also planned to start a family with her partner, professional ice hockey player P.K. Subban, and asked how she would like to be remembered, Vonn paused before answering. “I would like to be remembered as someone who was more than a ski racer. Hopefully, to my team mates as a good leader, and to the rest of the girls, the next generation, that I showed them that nothing is impossible,” she said. “Just realize that anything is possible if you work hard enough.” Reporting by Philip O'Connor; Additional reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ed Osmond and Hugh LawsonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Retiring Vonn aims to swap skis for business

REUTERS/Ammar AwadJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian driver they said had carried out a car-ramming attack on Friday that injured two Israeli civilians in the occupied West Bank, one of them critically. Reuters journalists at the scene saw police rolling the body of the driver into a plastic sheet. Palestinian health authorities identified him as a Palestinian national. An Israeli police spokesman said an officer who had been near the scene opened fire after the attacker rammed his car into people by the roadside near the Israeli settlement of Elazar, close to the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service said one of the Israelis, 17, was unresponsive and “in severe condition with multisystem trauma” and that the other, 19, had sustained moderate injuries.  Dozens of Israeli troops and medics were at the scene. The alleged attacker’s vehicle, which bore Israeli license plates which allow greater freedom of movement in both Israel and the West Bank, was overturned by the roadside. Police said the attacker had been driving along a road which weaves past Palestinian towns and Israeli settlements.  Palestinians carried out a wave of car-rammings in the West Bank in late 2015 and 2016, but the frequency of such incidents has since ebbed.  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

ADOM,"MISHMERET, Israel (Reuters) - A long-range rocket launched from the Gaza Strip struck a house in central Israel on Monday, wounding six people in the first such incident since a 2014 war in the Palestinian enclave, Israeli authorities said.  Israeli policemen and soldiers inspect a damaged house that was hit by a rocket north of Tel Aviv Israel March 25, 2019. REUTERS/ Ammar AwadThe early morning attack on Mishmeret, an agricultural town north of Tel Aviv, came at a time of high tension ahead of the anniversary of Gaza border protests at the weekend, and with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visiting Washington as he campaigns for a fifth term in an April 9 ballot.  Israel’s commercial capital and outlying communities had last come under such an attack during the 2014 war with Gaza’s dominant Hamas Islamists.  The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating six occupants of a home in Mishmeret, including an infant, for  wounds. TV images showed a building with extensive damage, and police said it had also been set aflame. The strike came minutes after the Israeli military activated air raid sirens in the area and said one rocket had been launched out of the Gaza Strip, a coastal territory 50 miles (80 km) away where Hamas and other factions possess such weapons.   Emmanuel Nahshon, spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, said the home in Mishmeret was hit by a rocket from Gaza.  There was no immediate Palestinian confirmation. Two rockets were launched at Tel Aviv on March 14 but caused no casualties or damage, Israel said. It blamed the rocket launches on Hamas, though a security official who declined to be identified by name or nationality later said that the salvo, which missed any built-up areas, had been set off by accident. There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu on Monday’s incident. His chief rival in next month’s election, centrist ex-general Benny Gantz, issued a statement accusing the rightist premier of having “bankrupted national security”.

ADOM,"DEIR IBZI’, West Bank (Reuters) - An Israeli teenager was killed and her father and brother were injured by a Palestinian bomb near a settlement in the occupied West Bank on Friday, Israeli officials said. Israeli forces gather at the scene of an attack near the Jewish settlement of Dolev in the Israeli-occupied West Bank August 23, 2019. REUTERS/Ammar AwadThe family were visiting a spring in a popular hiking area when an improvised explosive device (IED) blew up, the Israeli military and paramedics said. The military said it was being treated as a terrorist attack. It was not immediately clear if the device had been planted in advance or thrown. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service confirmed that 17-year-old Rina Shnerb had died at the scene and said her father and brother - named by Israeli media as Rabbi David Eitan, 46, and 21-year-old Dvir - were in serious condition. A large crowd of mourners gathered later on Friday for the teenager’s funeral in her home town of Lod, where her body was covered in a white shroud adorned with the Star of David. “This is insane, everything that’s happening here. I still can’t believe it,” said Shnerb’s sister Tamar. “Only yesterday you were here, joyful as always, you were happy and made everyone happy, as you always do.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to the family, and said security forces were pursuing the attackers. “The long arm of Israel reaches all those who seek our lives,” Netanyahu said in a statement, adding: “We will continue to strengthen settlement. We will deepen our roots and strike at our enemies.” The hilly central region of the West Bank around the settlement of Dolev lies northwest of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, and is studded with olive groves and orchards. The area saw clashes last year between Palestinians and Israelis, as Palestinian villagers complained that settlers were trying to take over land, including water sources. On Friday morning, the Israeli military quickly cordoned off the area around the Ein Bobin spring near the Palestinian village of Deir Ibzi’ while soldiers set up checkpoints on roads and searched the area. An Israeli student, Danny Gonen, was killed at the same spring in 2015 in an attack claimed by a group that said it was affiliated with the Islamist group Hamas. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised the latest attack but did not claim responsibility for it, warning Israel not to “assault our Jerusalem and our sacred sites”. In a speech in Gaza he said: “I bless this operation and I greet the hands of those who executed it. I pray for God to protect those who stood behind it. Regardless of who they are, they are Palestinians.” David Friedman, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, tweeted that he was “heartbroken and outraged”. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Jason Greenblatt, urged the Palestinian Authority to “unequivocally condemn” the attack.

ADOM,"GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel launched air strikes on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza  and deployed extra troops to the border on Monday in response to the longest-range Hamas rocket attack to cause casualties in years. After a day of intense cross-border fighting, Palestinian officials said Egypt had mediated a ceasefire, though the frontier did not remain calm for long. Rocket sirens sounded in southern Israel after the late-night truce was supposed to take effect, sending residents running for shelter. In Gaza, Palestinians reported Israeli planes attacked at least two targets.  Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, and smaller Palestinian factions put out a statement that Egypt had mediated a ceasefire even as the rockets were fired. Israeli officials did not comment on whether a truce had been reached. Monday’s violence began when seven Israelis were wounded near Tel Aviv by a morning rocket attack. The Gaza health ministry said five Palestinians were later wounded by a wave of retaliatory strikes. Dozens of explosions rocked the coastal enclave and ambulance sirens echoed in the mostly empty streets. In one Gaza neighborhood, people rushed to buy bread in anticipation of a long escalation. The office of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was one of the initial targets hit, although he was likely to have been evacuated in advance. Gaza militants fired barrages of rockets into Israel late into the night. Some were shot down by Israeli defenses and others landed in empty areas. The escalation came just two weeks before an election in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his political life after a decade in power, campaigning on a tough line against Palestinian militants. Beset by corruption scandals, he faces a strong challenge from a centrist coalition led by a top general.

The military said Hamas fired the rocket from about 120 km (75 miles) away, making it the longest-range attack from Gaza causing casualties since the last war in Gaza in 2014. Israel has waged three wars on Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. Israeli air strikes in retaliation for rockets from Gaza are a frequent occurrence, but Israel’s swift mobilization of extra troops to the border area was unusual.

The Israeli military said it was assigning two brigades to the Gaza area and some reservists were being called up. Reuters journalists saw troops moving toward the border, where the military also closed several roads to civilian traffic. “We are prepared for a wide range of scenarios,” chief spokesman Ronen Manelis said. Israeli towns near Gaza and Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial capital, opened bomb shelters in anticipation of rocket strikes. The rocket attack coincided with tension ahead of the March 30 anniversary of the start of weekly Gaza protests at the frontier in which some 200 Gazans have been killed and thousands wounded by Israeli fire. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Israel says it has no choice but to use deadly force at the protests to prevent militants from breaching the border fence.

ADOM,"GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Gaza militants fired more than 250 rockets into Israeli towns and villages through Saturday, while Israel hit back with tank shelling and air strikes that Palestinian officials said killed four people. A ball of fire is seen during an Israeli air strike in Gaza City May 4, 2019. REUTERS/Suhaib SalemCross-border hostilities which broke out on Friday flared into a second day, with Palestinians fleeing Israeli strikes in Gaza and air-raid sirens sending Israelis running to shelters as interceptor missiles blew up rockets in the sky.     The escalation, which comes just ahead of both the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Israel’s Independence Day holiday, prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to convene  security chiefs.  Egyptian mediators, credited with brokering ceasefires in previous rounds of violence, were working to prevent further hostilities. The latest round of violence began on Friday when a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers, according to the Israeli military.  Israel retaliated with an air strike that killed two militants from the armed Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Two other Palestinians protesting near the frontier were killed by Israeli forces on the same day, Palestinian officials said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad began firing waves of rockets into Israel early on Saturday. The Israeli military said its tanks and aircraft responded with strikes against more than 120 militant targets belonging to both groups. Explosions shook Gaza City, where busy streets were packed with shoppers preparing for Ramadan. The Gaza Health Ministry said a 14-month old baby, her pregnant mother and another man were killed by Israeli strikes and at least 20 other Palestinians were wounded. Residents identified two of them as militants.      “The Israeli plane fired a missile near the house and the shrapnel entered the house and hit the poor baby,” said her aunt, Ibtessam Abu Arar.  The Israeli military Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, questioned whether the baby was killed in an air strike.  “According to indications, the infant and her mother were killed as a result of Palestinian terrorist activities and not as a result of an Israeli raid,” he said on Twitter, without providing further details.  Two multi-storey buildings in Gaza City were destroyed by Israeli raids. One, the Israeli military said, housed Hamas’s intelligence and security offices. The other housed Islamic Jihad facilities, Palestinian sources said.  Witnesses said the Israeli military had warned people inside to evacuate the buildings before they were bombed. One of them  also housed the office of the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency. Ankara condemned the strike.       A small armed pro-Hamas group in Gaza, the Protectors of Al-Aqsa, said one of its men was killed in another air strike.  Related CoverageTurkey calls international community to act on 'disproportionate actions' by IsraelThe Magen David Adom ambulance service said two Israelis were wounded by shrapnel.  TRUCE EFFORTS Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said Israel was prepared to intensify its attacks. He added that Islamic Jihad was trying to destabilize the border and blamed Hamas for failing to rein it in.  Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the rocket barrages were a response to Friday’s events and that Israel has been delaying the implementation of previous understandings brokered by Cairo. In a joint statement, Hamas and Islamic Jihad said: “Our response will be broader and more painful if the enemy pursues its aggression.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli actions in Gaza. Hamas said on Thursday that its Gaza chief, Yeyha Sinwar, had traveled to Cairo for talks on efforts to maintain calm along the border and alleviate hardship in the enclave.  “Egypt has stepped up its efforts with Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and Israel, but there is no conclusion yet,” said a Palestinian official familiar with Cairo’s mediation efforts.  The United Nations has also been part of the Cairo talks.  “The United Nations is working with Egypt and all sides to calm the situation,” said U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov. “This endless cycle of violence must end and efforts must accelerate to realize a political solution to the crisis in Gaza.” “The United States strongly condemns the ongoing barrage of rocket attacks by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Saturday.   Although aerial exchanges are frequent, Israel and Hamas have managed to avert all-out war for the past five years.  Israel is due to host the 2019 Eurovision song contest finals in less than two weeks in Tel Aviv, towards which long-range rockets were launched in mid-March.     Some 2 million Palestinians live in Gaza, whose economy has suffered years of blockades as well as recent foreign aid cuts. Unemployment stands at 52 percent, according to the World Bank, and poverty is rampant. Israel says its blockade is necessary to stop weapons reaching Hamas, with which it has fought three wars since the group seized control of Gaza in 2007. Slideshow (14 Images)Over the past few weeks, Cairo’s mediation had helped persuade Israel to lift some restrictions on the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza and expand the Mediterranean zone where Gazans can fish.

Israeli media reports said the assailant was shot by a fellow resident of the Adam settlement, which lies between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah. There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials.   Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Palestinian Gaza Strip, praised the attack. Its spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, said it was a “heroic and brave operation that came in response to the daily, ugly crimes conducted by the Israeli occupation against our people.” Israeli-Palestinian tensions have surged in the past few months.  At least 140 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli fire in weekly border demonstrations. Israel says Hamas is using the protests as cover for a cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this. Palestinian militants have in recent weeks fired hundreds of rockets into Israel from Gaza and have opened fire at Israeli troops across the border, killing one soldier and drawing fatal Israeli air and tank strikes.     Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by the U.S. administration to restart them has so far shown little sign of progress. Palestinians want to establish a state in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005, annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and maintains control over more than half the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule. Most countries consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal. Israel disputes this.

AMR,"* Seeks to end coverage for retirees over 65 * Retirees under 65 would pay for AMR’s health plan By Nick Brown NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - The parent company of bankrupt American Airlines has sought court permission to reduce retiree health benefits and add out-of-pocket costs for access to certain coverage. Bruce Hicks, a company spokesman, said on Friday that AMR Corp would discontinue retiree life insurance and would end medical coverage for those over 65. That group would, instead, have access to a Medicare supplement at their own cost. Retirees under 65 would still have access to company plans, but at their own expense as well, Hicks said. AMR asked a New York bankruptcy judge to declare that it has the right to alter company-funded retiree benefits because they were never vested. American’s retiree health plans cover more than 40,000 people. In the filing, American argued that it would be required to maintain company-provided benefits only if it had promised to provide those benefits for life. AMR made no such promises, and explicitly reserved its right to modify its retiree benefit plans, it said. “The restructuring process is difficult for everyone affected, and we understand any changes to these benefits are concerning to our retirees,” Hicks said. A lawyer for a committee of retired workers did not respond to requests for comment. Other U.S. airlines reduced retiree health plans while in bankruptcy and eliminated or changed pension plans as well to save money. American sought bankruptcy protection in November, citing high labor costs. AMR has said it must save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in labor costs, and has sought to achieve those savings through concessions from workers, including unionized pilots, flight attendants and ground workers. Unions, livid over those demands, are supporting an effort by US Airways to merge with AMR, a prospect the unions say could salvage some jobs and benefits. AMR said it had $1.25 billion in retiree health and welfare liability as of 2010. The proposed cuts to retiree benefits are very similar to previously proposed changes that would affect current workers who retire in the future.

A worker walks underneath an American Airlines airplane at Miami International airport in Miami, Florida November 29, 2011.   REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe proposal, which would avert the largest pension default in U.S. history, could move the third-largest U.S. airline a step closer to consensual deals with its major unionized work groups as its struggles to slash uncompetitive labor costs. AMR, which filed for Chapter 11 on November 29, had been the only major airline to avoid bankruptcy in the last decade and is the only one that still has traditional, or defined benefit, pensions, the company said. “Freezing the defined benefit pension plans would mean that employees would retain the full value of benefits accrued for service prior to the date the plan is frozen,” said Jeff Brundage, AMR’s senior vice president of human Resources, in a letter to employees. “Freezing instead of terminating these plans of course would mean we will have significantly larger pension costs than contemplated in our business plan,” Brundage said. AMR has said it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion, including $1.25 billion in labor costs. AMR said it still must achieve the labor savings target and it would seek new capital to cover the incremental annual costs of funding frozen pensions. AMR said in letters to employees that the pension proposal does not extend to its pilots because their plan includes provisions for a costly lump sum payout to retiring workers that other work groups do not have. “Given the number of pilots who are eligible to retire, the company would be at significant operational risk if we emerge from Chapter 11 with a frozen plan that allows pilots to retire with a lump sum benefit,” Brundage said. AMR still wants to terminate the pilots’ plan unless it can get the lump sum matter resolved. The Allied Pilots Association said in a letter to members that it would ask them to waive the lump sum option in the plans that feature it so that those pensions can be frozen as well. “Our plan is the only one on the AMR property that includes the option of a lump sum and our experts have concluded that attempting to preserve a lump-sum option is not achievable,” APA President David Bates said. VICTORY FOR PENSION INSURER AMR said in February that it would seek bankruptcy court approval to terminate traditional pension plans covering 130,000 workers and retirees. Those plans would be replaced with 401(k) plans with a company match. Employer-financed defined benefit plans provide a fixed payout over time and are historically more generous than the 401(k) or other cash plans that mix employee and employer contributions that are more common today. Traditional pensions are often still found in heavily unionized industries such as airlines, autos and aerospace. AMR’s pensions covering pilots, flight attendants and ground workers were underfunded by an estimated $10 billion when the company filed for bankruptcy. Underfunding is the difference between the assets in a plan and the amount of future obligations. United Airlines had the largest pension default in the United States at nearly $9 billion underfunded. The decision is a victory for U.S. pension insurers, who waged a public campaign against plans by American to cancel its pensions in bankruptcy. “Bankruptcy forces tough choices, but that doesn’t mean pensions must be sacrificed for companies to succeed. We will continue to work with American and the other participants in the bankruptcy to ensure that success,” Josh Gotbaum, director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, said in a statement. The agency reported a record deficit of $26 billion in 2011 and is responsible for payouts to 1.5 million people. It paid more than $5 billion in benefits last year. In many cases, retirees get less in benefits when the government takes over the pensions of bankrupt companies. The Transport Workers Union, which represents many of the ground workers at AMR, cheered the plan, saying an earlier proposal to terminate pensions was “totally unacceptable.” “I have to say that I do consider it a win because terminating is not an option,” TWU President James Little told Reuters. “I think that would have been the most devastating.” He said that while TWU would rather keep its pension plans intact, a freeze is more palatable and advances the union’s goal of reaching a deal with AMR. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants said on its website that it has not responded to AMR’s proposal and that it was “meeting internally to evaluate the proposal.” American has almost 74,000 full- and part-time employees and its regional carrier American Eagle has about 14,000 full- and part-time employees. The company has been leaning on its labor unions to agree to concessions. Should AMR and its unions be unable to reach consensual deals, AMR could ask the bankruptcy judge to abrogate existing labor deals and allow the company to impose new terms.

AMR,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A bankruptcy judge on Thursday held off approval of a restructuring plan for American Airlines, citing a U.S. government challenge this week to the airline’s proposed merger with US Airways Group Inc LCC.N. A US Airways plane and an American Airlines plane share a terminal at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington April 23, 2012. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueAmerican’s parent company, AMR Corp AAMRQ.PK, worked out the $11 billion merger with US Airways as part of a plan to exit bankruptcy, where it has been since 2011. Judge Sean Lane had been expected to approve the plan at a hearing on Thursday. But, two days before the hearing, the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher fares and hurt consumers. Instead of approving the plan, Lane gave AMR and its creditors until August 23 to submit briefs on how he should proceed. Lane said he needed more information about the appropriateness of approving the restructuring plan in light of the antitrust challenge. AMR and US Airways, which have said they will fight the antitrust lawsuit, and their lawyers argued on Thursday that Lane should still approve the bankruptcy plan. A lawyer for US Airways, Daniel Wall, said the Justice Department’s timing, just two days before the final hearing, was “audacious.” “Don’t allow the bankruptcy issues, which are complicated enough on their own, to be held hostage to very late-filed antitrust issues,” Wall told the judge. But Lane cited “lingering doubts” about the benefits of approving a bankruptcy plan before the antitrust issue is resolved. “What would be the point of entering a confirmation order ... if, in fact, there’s a lot more work to be done?” he said. Under the restructuring plan, a reorganization cannot go ahead without antitrust approval for the merger, which could take months. If the Justice Department ultimately succeeds in blocking the merger, it would put AMR’s restructuring back at square one, requiring it to forge new strategies for paying back creditors. AMR shareholders, who stand to receive a 3.5 percent stake in the new entity under the merger, would likely be wiped out under any plan that excludes a merger, restructuring experts have said. Lane said he had strongly considered canceling Thursday’s hearing but decided to give parties an open forum to discuss the antitrust challenge. The bankruptcy plan has the support of nearly all of AMR’s key creditors, and Lane had already signed off on the merger and an initial outline of the restructuring plan that incorporates it. Absent the antitrust challenge, Thursday’s hearing would have been the final step in AMR’s exiting bankruptcy and implementing its merger.

AMR,"Feb 24 (Reuters) - AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, needs concessions from its labor groups in a matter of weeks, not months, in order to emerge from Chapter 11 in the near term, the company said on Friday. In a strongly worded labor negotiations update, the third-largest U.S. airline said it must make major changes to its contracts and that it does have the “luxury of time.” “As the company laid out in its February 1 restructuring announcement, we must make major changes to our labor agreements. And we need those changes in a matter of weeks,” the carrier said. AMR filed for Chapter 11 protection on Nov. 29, citing uncompetitive labor costs after years of fruitless talks with its unions. The carrier says it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion. The carrier dismissed requests for buyouts from unions representing its flight attendants and many ground workers, saying the proposals “represent a significant cost to the company and could not be accepted on their terms.” Unlike its top rivals United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, AMR did not restructure in bankruptcy in the last 10 years. Instead, it reorganized out of court, relying on its workers for voluntary concessions. United and Delta, however, emerged stronger from bankruptcy, later found merger partners and leapfrogged AMR in size. Those airlines are profitable now while AMR is not. AMR posted a net loss of net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. The president of the Transport Workers Union told Reuters in an interview this month that it will offer alternatives to some of the job cuts and concessions the company says it needs to survive and that the union needs more details on how AMR arrived at its cost-savings targets. AMR said in its update late on Friday it still hopes to reach consensual deals with its labor groups, rather than have terms imposed on them by the court.

AMR,"* Creditor had sought probe into pre-bankruptcy transactions * Sides resolve dispute, preserve potential legal claims * AMR can keep control of bankruptcy through Jan. 28 By Nick Brown NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Marathon Asset Management has withdrawn a request for an independent investigator to examine the books of American Airlines, a unit of bankrupt AMR Corp, lawyers for the companies said at a hearing on Thursday. The move came after AMR agreed to preserve potential clawback claims relating to debt deals, struck between Marathon and AMR, that left American Airlines with $2.26 billion of debt. AMR entered bankruptcy last November, and is considering its options for emerging either as a standalone firm or to merge with smaller competitor US Airways Group, which is making an aggressive takeover push. Marathon, which has said it holds “well over” $100 million of AMR debt, last month sought an examiner to probe intercompany transactions consummated in the weeks before AMR’s Chapter 11 filing. The deals transferred about $2.26 billion of debt from AMR’s American Eagle unit to American Airlines. Marathon said in court papers it was concerned that potential legal claims to claw the money back would be barred under the language of a separate settlement, under which AMR refinanced about 200 of its aircraft. AMR dismissed that argument in court filings as an “obvious litigation tactic.” But on Thursday, it agreed to expressly preserve such claims in exchange for Marathon dropping its request for an examiner, AMR attorney Richard Hahn said at the hearing in federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y.. The resolution also allows AMR to move forward with the underlying aircraft refinancing deal, which it says will save about $670 million on planes manufactured by Embraer. Marathon has been taking a more vocal role in AMR’s bankruptcy, adding another layer of complexity to the already multi-faceted case. The examiner request was Marathon’s second attempt to flex its muscles as a significant creditor, coming days after it sent a letter to AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton demanding more transparency about the airline’s restructuring efforts. It remains unclear whether Marathon supports a standalone restructuring or a US Airways merger, or whether Marathon would be in a position to finance an independent exit from bankruptcy for AMR. But as a large debtholder, the hedge fund could be in a position to influence either scenario by objecting to plans it does not support. US Airways would like to acquire AMR out of bankruptcy, while a group of debtholders including JPMorgan Chase & Co  has expressed interest in financing a standalone exit. AMR received court permission at Thursday’s hearing to extend for 30 days, through Jan. 28, its unilateral control of its bankruptcy exit plan. That means US Airways cannot propose its own takeover plan until that date, and that any merger plan before that date would have to be a cooperative effort with AMR. Labor issues will also affect AMR’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy independently. High labor costs were a driving force in the company’s bankruptcy filing, and while the airline has reached new collective bargaining deals with its flight attendants’ and ground workers’ unions, it remains at odds with its pilots. That could spook investors assessing the company’s stability going forward, and AMR’s creditors’ committee has said labor peace with pilots is a top priority. While AMR and its pilots continue to negotiate, the pilots have said they support a merger with US Airways. They have also said they already have a tentative labor deal in place with US Airways.

AMR,"* TWU wants to haggle over AMR cost cuts * Union says it wants to propose alternatives * Says awaits financial details from AMR By Kyle Peterson Feb 14 (Reuters) - The union representing seven categories of ground workers at bankrupt American Airlines will offer alternatives to some of the job cuts and concessions the company says it needs to survive, the head of the Transport Workers Union said on Tuesday. TWU has asked American’s parent company AMR Corp  for details on how it arrived at the cost-savings targets it unveiled this month when it said it planned to eliminate 13,000 jobs and terminate pensions. Union president James Little told Reuters in an interview the union hopes to draw on the labor deals it struck with the company prior to the Nov. 29 bankruptcy filing to salvage some of those jobs. “It’s irresponsible for us to take those numbers for granted and not do our own analysis,” Little said. AMR said it was aiming for $2 billion in total annual cost reductions, including $1.25 billion in employee-related expenses. American, the third-largest U.S. airline, said it may eliminate 13,000 jobs as part of its restructuring. About 9,000 of those workers are members of the TWU, which had already negotiated contracts or tentative labor deals for four of the seven work groups it represents at AMR when the company filed for Chapter 11. Little said the TWU is waiting for financial information from the company so it can either challenge the cost-savings targets or suggest alternatives to help AMR reach its targets in a way that makes the cuts more palatable to its members. “We would like to reach a consensual agreement,” Little said, adding that he expected other labor unions also to offer alternatives to the AMR’s plan. The airline has presented non-public details of its restructuring plan to members of its creditors committee. Labor unions representing pilots, flight attendants and groundworkers, have three of the nine seats AMR presented to creditors. Any reorganization plan would require approval from AMR’s bankruptcy court judge. AMR restructured out of court nearly 10 years ago, while several of its rivals like United Airlines and Delta Air Lines slashed costs with Chapter 11 protection. Those two airlines emerged from Chapter 11 stronger, went on to find merger partners and now earn profits while AMR posts losses. AMR, meanwhile, relied on voluntary concessions during its last reorganization but now complains its labor costs are higher than its competitors. American said it lost $10 billion over the past decade and financed the red ink with debt. The period was marked mainly by industry downturns triggered by the 2001 hijack attacks, recession, and skyrocketing fuel prices. American has about 73,800 full and part-time employees and its regional carrier American Eagle has 14,200 full- and part-time employees.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Labor union to suggest alternatives to AMR cost cuts

AMR,"(Reuters) - AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, said on Tuesday it eliminated five senior jobs as part of its restructuring and that its lead labor strategist would step down. An American Airlines plane sits at its gate while another taxis for departure at O'Hare International airport in Chicago November 29, 2011. AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, said on Tuesday it eliminated five senior jobs as part of its restructuring and that its lead labor strategist would step down. REUTERS/Frank PolichThe cuts, combined with the previously announced departure of other managers, represents a “20 percent reduction in the company’s most senior leadership positions,” AMR said in a statement. An AMR spokeswoman said eight or nine management jobs had been cut so far. AMR filed for bankruptcy in November, citing a need to slash uncompetitive costs. The company has said it intends to cut its overall costs by $2 billion a year. More than half of that amount will come from labor costs. “Redesigning the organization will help accelerate our progress toward profitability and success,” said AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton in a letter to employees. “Every step increases our clarity of purpose and helps speed decisions in the interest of best serving our customers.” Among the five departing executives are David Brooks, American’s President - Cargo, and Susan Garcia, American’s Vice President - Information Technology. In the same statement, AMR said Jeff Brundage, who is AMR’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources, has been replaced in his role by Denise Lynn, who will carry the job title Senior Vice President - People. The company did not say why Brundage was replaced. He will not immediately leave the company. “For now, I’m not going anywhere and will continue to work with many of you on the needed changes,” he said. Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former AMR executive, said Brundage’s departure is ironic amid the ongoing labor clash between AMR and its management. As AMR overhauls its management team, the airline is battling its unions in court over its request to void their labor contracts if workers do not willingly make the concessions the company says it needs to survive. American has been locked for years in fruitless negotiations with its three labor unions, which represent pilots, flight attendants and several classifications of ground workers. The airline won steep concessions from labor in 2003 as it dodged bankruptcy at the time. The carrier has about 74,000 full- and part-time workers. The company has said it must cut 13,000 union jobs. Against this backdrop, rival airline US Airways Group is hoping to jumpstart merger talks with AMR, which so far has shrugged off the interest. To further that goal, US Airways last month struck deals with AMR’s unions, which say US Airway’s plan save more jobs than AMR could through its stand-alone plan. The unions each have seats on AMR’s creditors committee, meaning they have a say in how AMR exits bankruptcy. For now, however, the carrier has the exclusive right under bankruptcy law to reorganize without interference from outsiders. The airline says it still hopes to reach consensual deals with its workers. AMR has presented what it calls its last and best offer to the Transport Workers Union, which represents 26,000 workers in seven work groups American Airlines. A TWU spokesman on Tuesday said information on AMR’s offer will be sent by mail to members this week with voting set to begin next week. American Airlines is the third-largest U.S. airline. It had been the only major U.S. airline to avoid Chapter 11 in the last decade, a factor that gave rivals a cost advantage.

FRED,"OSLO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The biggest shareholder in Fred. Olsen Energy on Thursday proposed changing the company’s name, days after it blamed the latest oil price plunge for the collapse of a rig sale deal to raise money to cut debts. The company, controlled by one of Norway’s richest families, the Olsens, has been trying to restructure debts of about $580 million and the refinancing plan included the sale of its newest rig Bolette Dolphin. But the plan to sell Bolette Dolphin for $340 million failed after a buyer pulled out of the talks, the company said on Tuesday. “The potential buyer of the Bolette Dolphin has withdrawn from the sales process given the significant change in oil and equity prices coupled with the uncertainty around the restructuring and sale process,” Fred. Olsen said at the time. Oil services companies like Fred. Olsen have borne the brunt of a downturn in the oil industry where oil companies had to cut spending to cope with a fall in oil prices. An oversupply of oil rigs added to the oil services industry’s pain by lowering day rates for rig hire. A number of Fred. Olsen’s rivals have been forced out of business or had to restructure. The oil price has since recovered, with North Sea oil hitting a four-year high of $86 per barrel in October, boosting rig owners’ hopes that oil companies will start spending again to replenish reserves. But in less than two months, oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel on concerns about a supply glut. The price drop also comes at the time of year when oil companies usually plan next year’s budgets. Rival drilling rig firm Seadrill , which emerged from U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July, has downplayed the impact of the recent oil market plunge. “The recent volatility in oil crisis has little bearing on how the vast majority of our customers invest. Their time horizon is much longer,” Seadrill Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz said during an earnings call on Tuesday.” Both Seadrill and Fred. Olsen Energy said in their outlooks that a broad rig market recovery has been taking place, and prices should rise next year. On Thursday, Fred. Olsen called an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Dec. 20 to approve a proposal to change its name to Dolphin Drilling, the name associated with large finds on the Norwegian continental shelf, including the country’s largest gas field Troll. The proposal came from its major shareholder Bonheur , an investment company of the Olsen family, which also has investments in renewable energy, cruise shipping, and media. The company was not immediately available to comment on the reason for the proposed name change. Fred. Olsen Energy also owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that built the RMS Titanic.

FRED,"OSLO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred. Olsen Energy, proposes to sell one of its drilling units and to issue $130-140 million in new equity to pay off debt, as part of a refinancing plan published on Tuesday. The proposal includes issuing about $90 million in new loan capital, paying $580 million to settle outstanding secured debt, and converting bond debt into equity. Existing shares of the company will represent approximately one percent of the share capital after the restructuring. The shares, which have fallen 99 percent over the last five years, closed down 25 percent. Last month, Fred. Olsen (FOE) said it was edging closer to a deal to solve the company’s financial situation, and warned that the deal could require new equity, amendments to the company’s bank and bond facilities, and sale of assets. The refinancing plan calls for the company to sell its Bolette Dolphin drilling unit. Fred. Olsen owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that build the RMS Titanic. “FOE will continue its discussions with its key stakeholders with the aim of securing the necessary support for its implementation, and note that the proposal remains subject to change following such discussions,” the company said. “Following such refinancing, Fred Olsen will continue as a four drilling unit company (including Blackford Dolphin, Bideford Dolphin, Borgland Dolphin and Byford Dolphin),” it added.

FRED,"OSLO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred. Olsen Energy, owner of the yard that built the RMS Titanic, is considering a debt and equity restructuring that would almost wipe out the value of its current shares, the company said. With debt and liabilities of more than $840 million at the end of June, Fred. Olsen last month stopped paying its creditors to preserve liquidity, making it the latest victim of a slow recovery in the oil and gas exploration sector. The owner of seven drillships and rigs, as well as Belfast’s Harland & Wolff yard, has now received indicative, non-binding proposals from equity investors valuing its current shares and bonds at just $10 million, it said in a statement. The company’s largest owner, Bonheur, which holds a 51.9 percent stake, separately said it had not decided whether to take part in the proposed refinancing. Fred. Olsen’s shares traded 15.9 percent lower in Oslo at 5.70 Norwegian crowns by 0804 GMT. The company has a 1.025 billion Norwegian crown ($124.63 million) bond maturing in February 2019, while bank debt of $611 million falls due the following year. “The deal implies conversion of bonds to equity and partial conversion of bank debt,” Chief Executive Ivar Brandvold told Reuters. The proposal would also secure an infusion of new equity financing and establish a “solid financial platform” for Fred. Olsen Energy to continue its operations, the firm said, although negotiations were still ongoing and no deadline had been set. Any deal would require approval from holders of the company’s bonds. In July, rig operator Seadrill emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after restructuring debts and liabilities of more than $10 billion.

A number of offshore rig owners had to restructure their debts, and some went out of business, due to prolonged decline in demand after oil prices plunged in 2014. Prices have partly recovered since hitting a low in January 2016, and demand for drilling rigs, especially in the North Sea, has increased. “I hope they will come to the agreement (with creditors)... The market’s recovery should help that by providing more opportunities to win new contracts,” Fredrik Lunde, head of research at Carnegie, said. Nordic banks DNB, Danske and Nordea hold the bulk of Fred. Olsen Energy’s bank debt. The waiver granted in January expired on June 30, and the financial terms of the debt agreements will be tested on July 20, the company said. Fred. Olsen Energy said it would operate as normal while continuing talks with stakeholders, creditors and their advisers. At the end of 2017, the company had $759 million outstanding under a syndicated bank loan, and a bond loan worth 1 billion crowns ($122 million) maturing in February 2019. During the first quarter, the company made a scheduled payment of about $95.5 million under the bank facility. Fred. Olsen Energy’s fleet consists of three deepwater and four harsh environment mid-water rigs, of which only one is being used - under a short-term contract with BP. The company’s shares were down 15 percent at 1045 GMT, underperforming the wider European oil and gas index which was down 0.7 percent. $1 = 8.1769 Norwegian crowns

IMI,"(Adds details, CEO/CFO comments, share reaction) By Steven Scheer TEL AVIV, May 28 (Reuters) - Israeli defence electronics firm Elbit Systems  reported a rise in first-quarter net profit on Tuesday and forecast further improvements in 2019 following its acquisition of IMI Systems. The maker of drones, pilot helmet displays and cyber security systems said it earned $1.54 per diluted share excluding one-time items in the January-March period, up from $1.29 a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.02 billion from $818.5 million. Elbit bought rival IMI Systems, a manufacturer of military systems best known for being an early maker of the Uzi submachine gun, from the government for $500 million in November. It has been merged into Elbit’s land division, making it among the top five companies for land-based systems. Elbit’s shares were up 1.8 percent at midday in Tel Aviv, pushing gains so far in 2019 to 21 percent. “A quarter ago I committed that IMI would be profitable in 2019. It’s already profitable,” Chief Executive Bezhalel Machlis told Reuters. He said that the full impact of IMI’s integration had yet to be reflected, adding: “We will see improvement in the coming quarters.” Chief Financial Officer Joseph Gaspar said IMI is expected to provide more than $500 million of revenues this year, although profit generated would depend on the pace of cost cutting and the number of contracts. IMI has already won a number of contracts since being folded into Elbit, including one with the United States Armed Forces, one in Israel and another in Asia, with more on the way, said Gaspar. Elbit, which has also seen growth in its network and communications business, has said it expects sales this year to exceed $4 billion, versus $3.7 billion in 2018. The company noted that 27 percent of sales stemmed from its U.S. units  but the company was growing in Europe and Asia-Pacific as well. “We see increased defence spending over almost all the world,” Machlis said. Elbit’s order backlog climbed to $9.66 billion at the end of March from $8.05 billion a year earlier. The company declared a dividend of 44 cents per share for the first quarter, the same as the fourth quarter.

IMI,"(Adds CEO, CFO comments from conference, details, share reaction) By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, March 19 (Reuters) - Israeli defence electronics firm Elbit Systems said costs relating to the acquisition of IMI Systems sent its quarterly profit lower, but forecast that the weapons and military technology maker will start to make a profit this year. The maker of drones, pilot helmet displays and cyber security systems said on Tuesday it earned $1.91 per diluted share in the October-December period, down from $2.01 a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.08 billion from $1.0 billion. In November Elbit bought IMI from the government for $500 million. It said expenses related to the deal reached $69.5 million in the quarter. Elbit shares were down 1.7 percent in afternoon trade in Tel Aviv. They are up 8 percent so far this year after a 7 percent drop in 2018. The acquisition will bring many synergies and puts the company in “a different league” of defence players, said CEO Bezhalel Machlis. “Sales in 2019 will be well above $4 billion,” he told an investors’ conference. This compares with $3.7 billion for Elbit in 2018. Elbit said IMI has been merged into its land division which will more than double its annual sales of $500 million and places it among the top five companies for land-based systems. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Gaspar said IMI was in a difficult financial situation when Elbit bought it, lacking cash and access to credit. Elbit provided guarantees to the banks, injected cash to liquidate loans and reached an agreement with IMI’s union to let go a few hundred workers out of about 3,000. “The bottom line is that they now have cash to run the business,” he said. The land division will be profitable in 2019 and within a few years is expected to match profit levels at Elbit, which has gross margins of 28-29 percent and operating margins of 9-10 percent. “Elbit will continue to grow in 2019 in terms of revenue and profit,” Machlis said. Elbit’s order backlog climbed to $9.4 billion at the end of December from $7.6 billion a year earlier. IMI added about $1 billion to the backlog. At IMI only about 14 percent of sales are from exports but this is starting to change. Machlis said the company will report in the coming weeks a new export contract for guided munitions but did not provide details. Elbit declared a dividend of 44 cents per share for the fourth quarter, the same as the third quarter.

SKIS,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Uganda Airlines has taken to the skies once more after almost two decades out of action, but flies into a crowded aviation market in Africa where carriers have the weakest finances and emptiest planes of any region in the world. The state carrier launched commercial flights on Wednesday, its first since it was liquidated in 2001, aiming to take a slice of the East African aviation business that is dominated by Ethiopian Airlines, the continent’s success story. Uganda is the latest African government to pour money into national flag carriers; Tanzania and Senegal are also resurrecting their airlines, while the likes of Rwanda, Ivory Coast and Togo are expanding theirs.  But such efforts have been hampered by high business costs as well as protectionism, which has impeded a continental open-skies agreement - something industry experts say is vital for the success of African carriers in a tough market.  The African market is forecast to grow almost 5% a year over the next two decades in terms of passengers, faster than mature markets, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). However, this is from a low base and most state-owned flag carriers in the region are losing money.  While the global aviation industry is on track to make a profit of $28 billion, African airlines are projected to make combined losses of $100 million this year, IATA said in June. Uganda Airlines, like some of its rivals, aims to attract more domestic travelers to help it buck the gloomy continental trend. Around 2 million passengers per year travel through Entebbe, Uganda’s main airport. Around 70% are Ugandans, said the carrier’s CEO Ephraim Bagenda.  “All those currently travel on foreign airlines,” he told Reuters. “We want part of that cake.”  CLOSED SKIES Last year, it looked like Africa was making progress on an open-skies agreement - the Single African Air Transport Market - to let airlines decide how frequently they fly between cities and which aircraft they use.  A total of 28 countries have signed up, accounting for 75-80% of African air traffic. Uganda is considering signing, Works and Transport Minister Monica Azuba Ntege said.  However, so far only 10 signatories - including Cape Verde, Ghana, Togo, Ethiopia and Nigeria - have begun changing their own laws to implement the deal and open up their markets, said Raphael Kuuchi, Vice President for Africa at IATA. The patchy efforts undermine the agreement and hobble direct connections within Africa, say analysts. Some airlines, including from countries that have signed up, oppose the open-skies deal because they fear bigger competitors. “The most subsidized airlines and the biggest ones are going to take the biggest market share because they (are) able to afford it,” Kenya Airways CEO Sebastian Mikosz told an investor briefing on Tuesday. “They are going to kill the smaller national airlines which are just starting because they will have no way to defend themselves.” Ethiopian Airlines, sub-Saharan Africa’s only successful large state-owned airline, has bucked the regional trend and has been expanding fast, thanks in part to having secured key traffic rights in two ways.  First, it signed bilateral agreements with nearly all African countries in the 1970s, activating them as needed, said Kuuchi. The airline flew to parts of the continent served by few other carriers and leveraged that goodwill to open up markets.  “Governments were willing to give them additional rights, and travel rights, once you give them out, it’s very difficult to retract,” he added. More recently, Ethiopian has been helping other countries launch their own carriers and taking a stake. That has created regional continental hubs in Togo, Malawi and Chad where it can pick up and feed traffic into its main hub in Addis Ababa, cementing its dominance and rivaling Gulf carriers. Now governments are hoarding travel rights to protect their own airlines, so African carriers are struggling to set up hubs vital to winning international travelers, said Girma Wake, former CEO of Ethiopian Airlines. “Instead of flying point-to-point everywhere, if they can collect traffic from the low-traffic areas and bring them to major hubs and carry them from those major hubs, you will be in a better position,” he told Reuters.  HIGH FUEL COSTS, TAXES African aviation accounted for only 2.1% of the global market in 2018, with 92 million passenger journeys flown, and non-African airlines including Emirates and Turkish Airlines account for around 80% of traffic in and out of the continent, IATA said.  African airlines are also struggling to improve load factors - percentage of seats filled - from the world’s lowest regional level of 71% in 2018, compared with 81.2% globally, according to IATA. Emirates builds traffic through its global Dubai hub, an advantage most African airlines don’t have - except Ethiopian Airlines. As well as protectionism, high fuel and taxation hurt African carriers.  In Europe, a passenger can travel 1.5 hours for less than $100 all-inclusive. In Africa, passenger taxes alone range from $40 to $150 per passenger, African Airlines Association Secretary General Abderahmane Berthe told Reuters. “Many governments are levying taxes on aviation and not reinvesting these collected amounts in aviation,” he said.  Governments often see air transport as a luxury that can sustain high taxes, said Air Tanzania managing director Ladislaus Matindi.  Fuel is also taxed heavily and must often be trucked in, an expensive operation. Fuel makes up about a quarter of operating costs globally but reaches 30-40% in Africa, Berthe said. Uganda Airlines, founded by former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, was liquidated in 2001 after years of unprofitability during a push to privatize state firms. Other African state carriers have been crippled by government interference, such as insisting on routes to unprofitable but politically important destinations.

SKIS,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - While smoke from forest fires in Indonesia often simply obscures visibility with a choking haze, parts of Sumatra island recently witnessed blood red skies due to the interaction of sunlight on particles from smoke in the air.   A glowing red sky is seen in Kumpeh District in Muaro Jambi Regency, Indonesia in this still image obtained from a September 21, 2019 social media video. INSTAGRAM @DANI_KHOLIK via REUTERSThe Southeast Asian country has spent months battling fires, often caused by slash-and-burn farming practices, as an El Nino weather pattern exacerbates the annual dry season and helps create a haze across the region. Yunita, a resident who filmed the crimson sky on Saturday, said there had been “strong winds, and the smog was thick. The event lasted from noon until evening, breathing was quite hard on that day”. The event quickly went viral on social media, with one video notching up over 600,000 views on Instagram in three days.  In order for a red sky to occur aerosols must be present in the air, A. R. Ravishankara, a U.S.-based scientist was cited in an article posted on the website of Scientific American. Aerosols are solid or liquid particles suspended in air that can originate from both natural processes and human activity. The natural form can come from forest fires, dust kicked up by sandstorms, sea spray or volcanic eruptions, among other things. Indonesia’s meteorology agency said the sky had turned red in parts of Sumatra due to the “scattering  of sunlight by particles floating in the air, also known as Mie scattering”. The agency said that there had been very thick smoke in the  Muaro Jambi area of Sumatra last weekend with satellite analysis revealing many hot spots. “The smoke from the forest fire was different than other areas experiencing forest fires,” the agency said. The satellite showed some areas appeared brown but Jambi appeared white, indicating the smoke to be very thick,” the agency said, noting the fires were likely from highly flammable peat.     For some Indonesians, it was as mysterious as it was concerning.    “This is the earth not Mars. This is Jambi not outer space....We are humans who need to breathe clean air, not smoke,” said one Twitter user @zunishofiyn.

Kjetil and Aksel did something really special today. “Aksel is a legend and will go down as that.” Svindal, who will quit with 80 World Cup podiums to his name, including 36 wins, said he had been determined to go out in spectacular fashion. “I thought it would be the right thing to do to give it a hell of a show,” he said.  “Last year, Kjetil and I did the same thing in the Olympics but I won the gold, so he deserves it today.” Jansrud, who won Super-G gold at the Sochi Olympics, is not exactly a new kid on the block at the age of 33. “Kjetil is nearly as old as I am so he will take over the dad character for sure!” Svindal, who has finally called it a day after persistent knee problems, said. “I think we have a cool team, we work hard on that too. How many days do you get like this every year? This is like one in a thousand, or one in a hundred. “You really have to make it a life worth living as a downhill skier. It’s been an emotional couple of weeks, and I was ready to get this over with to be honest and hammer it one last time and that’s it! I am happy we did well today.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing  by Toby DavisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Alpine skiing: Jansrud now the daddy of the Norwegian Vikings
SKIS,"ARE, Sweden (Reuters) - With just one race left in her career, American Lindsey Vonn is aiming to swap Alpine skiing for success in the boardroom when she retires from the sport after Sunday’s downhill competition at the World Championships in Sweden. Alpine Skiing - FIS Alpine World Ski Championships - Opening ceremony - Are, Sweden - February 4, 2019 - Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. during the ceremony. REUTERS/Leonhard FoegerVonn sustained a black eye when crashing out of Tuesday’s Super G early, but she said she is looking forward to one last race and one big party to bring to an end almost two decades in the sport. After battling knee injuries throughout her career, the 34-year-old announced last week that she was calling it a day. Vonn has racked up 82 World Cup victories in a glittering career and won the United State’s first Olympic downhill gold for women. “There’s a lot to look forward to. I’m going to approach business in the same way I approach skiing, just work as hard as I can and stay diligent about it,” an upbeat Vonn told reporters on Tuesday. She will continue her relationships with her sponsors and is branching out into movies as an executive producer, and she also hinted at a new secret project that is in the works. “I hope that one day they’ll say, ‘Oh, she was a skier a long time ago, but now she’s a successful businesswoman’. Next goal, take over the world, one step at a time,” she said. Though Vonn admitted that she had had a turbulent time of it emotionally since realizing recently that the end of her career was in sight, she chided reporters for not laughing enough at her jokes as she tried to keep the mood light while outlining her future. “I’m a driven person, I’m not going to be sitting on the couch twiddling my thumbs, that would be boring. I need to do something that activates my mind. I can’t activate my body the way I used to, but it’s all about pushing yourself,” she said. Vonn won’t be letting her lack of business experience hold her back, either. “I went to Harvard for four days, so I feel like I know something!” she said with a broad grin. The three-time Olympic medalist revealed that she also planned to start a family with her partner, professional ice hockey player P.K. Subban, and asked how she would like to be remembered, Vonn paused before answering. “I would like to be remembered as someone who was more than a ski racer. Hopefully, to my team mates as a good leader, and to the rest of the girls, the next generation, that I showed them that nothing is impossible,” she said. “Just realize that anything is possible if you work hard enough.” Reporting by Philip O'Connor; Additional reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ed Osmond and Hugh LawsonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Retiring Vonn aims to swap skis for business
