#### The Scraper
The new scraper is built on top of the previous one and is tailored to utilize Google News RSS. 
<p> Need to import newspaper3k to run the crawler (Thanks Peilin, I'm using your code here)</p> 
<p> FYI: https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ </p>

#### To run the crawler
Simply open a commandline tool, cd to the directory and run:
```bash 
$ python suspended_crawler.py
```
and 
```bash 
$ python google_news_crawler.py
```
