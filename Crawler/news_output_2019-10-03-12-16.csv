REUTERS/Ammar AwadJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian driver they said had carried out a car-ramming attack on Friday that injured two Israeli civilians in the occupied West Bank, one of them critically. Reuters journalists at the scene saw police rolling the body of the driver into a plastic sheet. Palestinian health authorities identified him as a Palestinian national. An Israeli police spokesman said an officer who had been near the scene opened fire after the attacker rammed his car into people by the roadside near the Israeli settlement of Elazar, close to the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service said one of the Israelis, 17, was unresponsive and “in severe condition with multisystem trauma” and that the other, 19, had sustained moderate injuries.  Dozens of Israeli troops and medics were at the scene. The alleged attacker’s vehicle, which bore Israeli license plates which allow greater freedom of movement in both Israel and the West Bank, was overturned by the roadside. Police said the attacker had been driving along a road which weaves past Palestinian towns and Israeli settlements.  Palestinians carried out a wave of car-rammings in the West Bank in late 2015 and 2016, but the frequency of such incidents has since ebbed.  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Israeli policemen and soldiers inspect a damaged house that was hit by a rocket north of Tel Aviv Israel March 25, 2019. REUTERS/ Ammar AwadThe early morning attack on Mishmeret, an agricultural town north of Tel Aviv, came at a time of high tension ahead of the anniversary of Gaza border protests at the weekend, and with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visiting Washington as he campaigns for a fifth term in an April 9 ballot.  Israel’s commercial capital and outlying communities had last come under such an attack during the 2014 war with Gaza’s dominant Hamas Islamists.  The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating six occupants of a home in Mishmeret, including an infant, for  wounds. TV images showed a building with extensive damage, and police said it had also been set aflame. The strike came minutes after the Israeli military activated air raid sirens in the area and said one rocket had been launched out of the Gaza Strip, a coastal territory 50 miles (80 km) away where Hamas and other factions possess such weapons.   Emmanuel Nahshon, spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, said the home in Mishmeret was hit by a rocket from Gaza.  There was no immediate Palestinian confirmation. Two rockets were launched at Tel Aviv on March 14 but caused no casualties or damage, Israel said. It blamed the rocket launches on Hamas, though a security official who declined to be identified by name or nationality later said that the salvo, which missed any built-up areas, had been set off by accident. There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu on Monday’s incident. His chief rival in next month’s election, centrist ex-general Benny Gantz, issued a statement accusing the rightist premier of having “bankrupted national security”.

Israeli forces gather at the scene of an attack near the Jewish settlement of Dolev in the Israeli-occupied West Bank August 23, 2019. REUTERS/Ammar AwadThe family were visiting a spring in a popular hiking area when an improvised explosive device (IED) blew up, the Israeli military and paramedics said. The military said it was being treated as a terrorist attack. It was not immediately clear if the device had been planted in advance or thrown. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service confirmed that 17-year-old Rina Shnerb had died at the scene and said her father and brother - named by Israeli media as Rabbi David Eitan, 46, and 21-year-old Dvir - were in serious condition. A large crowd of mourners gathered later on Friday for the teenager’s funeral in her home town of Lod, where her body was covered in a white shroud adorned with the Star of David. “This is insane, everything that’s happening here. I still can’t believe it,” said Shnerb’s sister Tamar. “Only yesterday you were here, joyful as always, you were happy and made everyone happy, as you always do.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to the family, and said security forces were pursuing the attackers. “The long arm of Israel reaches all those who seek our lives,” Netanyahu said in a statement, adding: “We will continue to strengthen settlement. We will deepen our roots and strike at our enemies.” The hilly central region of the West Bank around the settlement of Dolev lies northwest of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, and is studded with olive groves and orchards. The area saw clashes last year between Palestinians and Israelis, as Palestinian villagers complained that settlers were trying to take over land, including water sources. On Friday morning, the Israeli military quickly cordoned off the area around the Ein Bobin spring near the Palestinian village of Deir Ibzi’ while soldiers set up checkpoints on roads and searched the area. An Israeli student, Danny Gonen, was killed at the same spring in 2015 in an attack claimed by a group that said it was affiliated with the Islamist group Hamas. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised the latest attack but did not claim responsibility for it, warning Israel not to “assault our Jerusalem and our sacred sites”. In a speech in Gaza he said: “I bless this operation and I greet the hands of those who executed it. I pray for God to protect those who stood behind it. Regardless of who they are, they are Palestinians.” David Friedman, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, tweeted that he was “heartbroken and outraged”. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Jason Greenblatt, urged the Palestinian Authority to “unequivocally condemn” the attack.

A ball of fire is seen during an Israeli air strike in Gaza City May 4, 2019. REUTERS/Suhaib SalemCross-border hostilities which broke out on Friday flared into a second day, with Palestinians fleeing Israeli strikes in Gaza and air-raid sirens sending Israelis running to shelters as interceptor missiles blew up rockets in the sky.     The escalation, which comes just ahead of both the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Israel’s Independence Day holiday, prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to convene  security chiefs.  Egyptian mediators, credited with brokering ceasefires in previous rounds of violence, were working to prevent further hostilities. The latest round of violence began on Friday when a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers, according to the Israeli military.  Israel retaliated with an air strike that killed two militants from the armed Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Two other Palestinians protesting near the frontier were killed by Israeli forces on the same day, Palestinian officials said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad began firing waves of rockets into Israel early on Saturday. The Israeli military said its tanks and aircraft responded with strikes against more than 120 militant targets belonging to both groups. Explosions shook Gaza City, where busy streets were packed with shoppers preparing for Ramadan. The Gaza Health Ministry said a 14-month old baby, her pregnant mother and another man were killed by Israeli strikes and at least 20 other Palestinians were wounded. Residents identified two of them as militants.      “The Israeli plane fired a missile near the house and the shrapnel entered the house and hit the poor baby,” said her aunt, Ibtessam Abu Arar.  The Israeli military Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, questioned whether the baby was killed in an air strike.  “According to indications, the infant and her mother were killed as a result of Palestinian terrorist activities and not as a result of an Israeli raid,” he said on Twitter, without providing further details.  Two multi-storey buildings in Gaza City were destroyed by Israeli raids. One, the Israeli military said, housed Hamas’s intelligence and security offices. The other housed Islamic Jihad facilities, Palestinian sources said.  Witnesses said the Israeli military had warned people inside to evacuate the buildings before they were bombed. One of them  also housed the office of the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency. Ankara condemned the strike.       A small armed pro-Hamas group in Gaza, the Protectors of Al-Aqsa, said one of its men was killed in another air strike.  Related CoverageTurkey calls international community to act on 'disproportionate actions' by IsraelThe Magen David Adom ambulance service said two Israelis were wounded by shrapnel.  TRUCE EFFORTS Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said Israel was prepared to intensify its attacks. He added that Islamic Jihad was trying to destabilize the border and blamed Hamas for failing to rein it in.  Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the rocket barrages were a response to Friday’s events and that Israel has been delaying the implementation of previous understandings brokered by Cairo. In a joint statement, Hamas and Islamic Jihad said: “Our response will be broader and more painful if the enemy pursues its aggression.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli actions in Gaza. Hamas said on Thursday that its Gaza chief, Yeyha Sinwar, had traveled to Cairo for talks on efforts to maintain calm along the border and alleviate hardship in the enclave.  “Egypt has stepped up its efforts with Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and Israel, but there is no conclusion yet,” said a Palestinian official familiar with Cairo’s mediation efforts.  The United Nations has also been part of the Cairo talks.  “The United Nations is working with Egypt and all sides to calm the situation,” said U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov. “This endless cycle of violence must end and efforts must accelerate to realize a political solution to the crisis in Gaza.” “The United States strongly condemns the ongoing barrage of rocket attacks by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Saturday.   Although aerial exchanges are frequent, Israel and Hamas have managed to avert all-out war for the past five years.  Israel is due to host the 2019 Eurovision song contest finals in less than two weeks in Tel Aviv, towards which long-range rockets were launched in mid-March.     Some 2 million Palestinians live in Gaza, whose economy has suffered years of blockades as well as recent foreign aid cuts. Unemployment stands at 52 percent, according to the World Bank, and poverty is rampant. Israel says its blockade is necessary to stop weapons reaching Hamas, with which it has fought three wars since the group seized control of Gaza in 2007. Slideshow (14 Images)Over the past few weeks, Cairo’s mediation had helped persuade Israel to lift some restrictions on the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza and expand the Mediterranean zone where Gazans can fish. But Israel scaled back the fishing zone this week in response to rocket fire and shut the border crossings entirely on Saturday after barrages from Gaza.

Its spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, said it was a “heroic and brave operation that came in response to the daily, ugly crimes conducted by the Israeli occupation against our people.” Israeli-Palestinian tensions have surged in the past few months.  At least 140 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli fire in weekly border demonstrations. Israel says Hamas is using the protests as cover for a cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this. Palestinian militants have in recent weeks fired hundreds of rockets into Israel from Gaza and have opened fire at Israeli troops across the border, killing one soldier and drawing fatal Israeli air and tank strikes.     Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by the U.S. administration to restart them has so far shown little sign of progress. Palestinians want to establish a state in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005, annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and maintains control over more than half the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule.

Olsen shareholder proposes name change to Dolphin Drilling,"OSLO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The biggest shareholder in Fred. Olsen Energy on Thursday proposed changing the company’s name, days after it blamed the latest oil price plunge for the collapse of a rig sale deal to raise money to cut debts. The company, controlled by one of Norway’s richest families, the Olsens, has been trying to restructure debts of about $580 million and the refinancing plan included the sale of its newest rig Bolette Dolphin. But the plan to sell Bolette Dolphin for $340 million failed after a buyer pulled out of the talks, the company said on Tuesday. “The potential buyer of the Bolette Dolphin has withdrawn from the sales process given the significant change in oil and equity prices coupled with the uncertainty around the restructuring and sale process,” Fred. Olsen said at the time. Oil services companies like Fred. Olsen have borne the brunt of a downturn in the oil industry where oil companies had to cut spending to cope with a fall in oil prices. An oversupply of oil rigs added to the oil services industry’s pain by lowering day rates for rig hire. A number of Fred. Olsen’s rivals have been forced out of business or had to restructure. The oil price has since recovered, with North Sea oil hitting a four-year high of $86 per barrel in October, boosting rig owners’ hopes that oil companies will start spending again to replenish reserves. But in less than two months, oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel on concerns about a supply glut. The price drop also comes at the time of year when oil companies usually plan next year’s budgets. Rival drilling rig firm Seadrill , which emerged from U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July, has downplayed the impact of the recent oil market plunge. “The recent volatility in oil crisis has little bearing on how the vast majority of our customers invest. Their time horizon is much longer,” Seadrill Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz said during an earnings call on Tuesday.” Both Seadrill and Fred. Olsen Energy said in their outlooks that a broad rig market recovery has been taking place, and prices should rise next year. On Thursday, Fred. Olsen called an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Dec. 20 to approve a proposal to change its name to Dolphin Drilling, the name associated with large finds on the Norwegian continental shelf, including the country’s largest gas field Troll. The proposal came from its major shareholder Bonheur , an investment company of the Olsen family, which also has investments in renewable energy, cruise shipping, and media. The company was not immediately available to comment on the reason for the proposed name change. Fred. Olsen Energy also owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that built the RMS Titanic.

Olsen Energy proposes to issue new equity in restructuring,"OSLO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred. Olsen Energy, proposes to sell one of its drilling units and to issue $130-140 million in new equity to pay off debt, as part of a refinancing plan published on Tuesday. The proposal includes issuing about $90 million in new loan capital, paying $580 million to settle outstanding secured debt, and converting bond debt into equity. Existing shares of the company will represent approximately one percent of the share capital after the restructuring. The shares, which have fallen 99 percent over the last five years, closed down 25 percent. Last month, Fred. Olsen (FOE) said it was edging closer to a deal to solve the company’s financial situation, and warned that the deal could require new equity, amendments to the company’s bank and bond facilities, and sale of assets. The refinancing plan calls for the company to sell its Bolette Dolphin drilling unit. Fred. Olsen owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that build the RMS Titanic. “FOE will continue its discussions with its key stakeholders with the aim of securing the necessary support for its implementation, and note that the proposal remains subject to change following such discussions,” the company said. “Following such refinancing, Fred Olsen will continue as a four drilling unit company (including Blackford Dolphin, Bideford Dolphin, Borgland Dolphin and Byford Dolphin),” it added. Fred. Olsen stopped paying its creditors in July to preserve liquidity, making it the latest victim of a slow recovery in the oil and gas exploration sector.

Olsen Energy edges closer to financial restructuring,"OSLO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred. Olsen Energy, owner of the yard that built the RMS Titanic, is considering a debt and equity restructuring that would almost wipe out the value of its current shares, the company said. With debt and liabilities of more than $840 million at the end of June, Fred. Olsen last month stopped paying its creditors to preserve liquidity, making it the latest victim of a slow recovery in the oil and gas exploration sector. The owner of seven drillships and rigs, as well as Belfast’s Harland & Wolff yard, has now received indicative, non-binding proposals from equity investors valuing its current shares and bonds at just $10 million, it said in a statement. The company’s largest owner, Bonheur, which holds a 51.9 percent stake, separately said it had not decided whether to take part in the proposed refinancing. Fred. Olsen’s shares traded 15.9 percent lower in Oslo at 5.70 Norwegian crowns by 0804 GMT. The company has a 1.025 billion Norwegian crown ($124.63 million) bond maturing in February 2019, while bank debt of $611 million falls due the following year. “The deal implies conversion of bonds to equity and partial conversion of bank debt,” Chief Executive Ivar Brandvold told Reuters. The proposal would also secure an infusion of new equity financing and establish a “solid financial platform” for Fred. Olsen Energy to continue its operations, the firm said, although negotiations were still ongoing and no deadline had been set. Any deal would require approval from holders of the company’s bonds. In July, rig operator Seadrill emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after restructuring debts and liabilities of more than $10 billion.

I would like to thank everyone at Shakhtar Donetsk for everything they have done for me over the past five years.” Fred is in the Brazil World Cup squad, but was an unused substitute for the 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game. Fred will compete for a midfield place with Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic next season as United aim to challenge champions Manchester City for the Premier League title. “Fred will complement our other midfielders’ qualities, which we need; his creative brain and passing vision will give us another dimension to our game,” Mourinho said. Fred won three Ukrainian league titles with Shakhtar after joining from Brazil’s Internacional in 2013. United also signed Portuguese full back Diogo Dalot from Porto this month.

Brazil team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari reacts during a news conference held after a team soccer training session at the national stadium in Brasilia ahead of their 2014 World Cup Group A soccer match against Cameroon June 22, 2014.    REUTERS/Ueslei MarcelinoCoach Luiz Felipe Scolari’s first move when he took over the side 18 months ago was to field a target man, a role which had fallen out of favor under his predecessor Mano Menezes. However, Brazil, who could previously call on the likes of Ronaldo, Careca and Romario, are suffering from a dearth of center-forwards and Scolari is dependent on out-of-form Fred and Jo at the World Cup. Scolari initially handed the role to Luis Fabiano is his first match in charge against England in February last year and replaced him with former Olympique Lyon striker Fred at halftime. Fred, now at Fluminense, immediately impressed, scoring Brazil’s goal in a 2-1 defeat, and kept the role for last year’s Confederations Cup, where he finished as joint top-scorer with five goals to help Brazil win the title. Shortly afterwards, the 30-year-old, who played at the 2006 World Cup, suffered a long-term injury and spent the run-up to the World Cup trying to regain his form. Scolari, wanting to remain loyal to the Confederations Cup squad, reassured Fred that he remained the first choice. However, Fred has not refound last year’s form and his cause was not helped by the poor standard of opposition in the season-opening Carioca (Rio de Janeiro state) championship. Central defender Thiago Silva said Fred, who won a controversial penalty against Croatia but was ineffective in the 0-0 draw against Mexico, should not be judged by the number of goals he scores. “Fred is still an important player for our team and he doesn’t have to score every game,” said Thiago Silva. “His job is to participate and if he can help the team by opening up space for Neymar and other players to score, we will all be happy. “He doesn’t have to worry about scoring, he has to think about the team, the group and he is quite unruffled because the same thing happened in the Confederations Cup. “I am sure that he will start scoring goals in any case. It will be the same story as the Confederations Cup, when he didn’t score in the first two games.” “I’m sure that tomorrow (Monday) he will score a goal and take this weight off his shoulders, of course a striker lives by goals and I’m with him.” Brazil play Cameroon in their final Group A game on Monday needing a point to progress.

FILE PHOTO: Nov 19, 2018; Los Angeles, CA: Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt (27) celebrates scoring in the second quarter against the Los Angeles Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY SportsHunt, a Pro Bowl pick as a rookie in 2017 on his way to a repeat in 2018 with the Kansas City Chiefs, is currently on the exempt list while the NFL investigates an assault captured on video last February. The incident prompted his immediate release by the Chiefs in November. Hunt would become a restricted free agent in March 2020, which is significant because the Browns would retain rights of first refusal if another team signs Hunt to an offer sheet. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported on air Monday that Hunt was facing a “10 or 12 game” suspension and could even be suspended for the “majority or the entire 2019 season.” The Browns also have Nick Chubb, a second-round pick in 2018, at running back. Browns general manager John Dorsey drafted Hunt out of Toledo and has been in contact with him during an ongoing suspension. “My relationship and interaction with Kareem since 2016 in college was an important part of this decision making process but we then did extensive due diligence with many individuals, including clinical professionals, to have a better understanding of the person he is today and whether it was prudent to sign him,” Dorsey said in a statement. “There were two important factors: one is that Kareem took full responsibility for his egregious actions and showed true remorse and secondly, just as importantly, he is undergoing and is committed to necessary professional treatment and a plan that has been clearly laid out.” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during his Super Bowl week address that the league hoped to finish an investigation — and render any decision on discipline — very soon. Hunt issued a statement Monday after the deal became official. “First off, I would like to once again apologize for my actions last year. What I did was wrong and inexcusable,” Hunt said. “That is not the man I was raised to be, and I’ve learned a great deal from that experience and certainly should have been more truthful about it after the fact. I’m extremely grateful that John Dorsey, Dee and Jimmy Haslam and the Cleveland Browns organization are granting me the opportunity to earn their trust and represent their organization in the best way possible on and off the field. I am committed to following the necessary steps to learn and to be a better and healthier person from this situation. I also understand the expectations that the Browns have clearly laid out and that I have to earn my way back to the NFL. I’m a work in progress as a person, but I’m committed to taking advantage of the support systems that I have in place to become the best and healthier version of myself.” Dorsey has shown a willingness to align with players with skeletons in their closet in the past, including drafting wide receiver Tyreek Hill despite a serious guilty plea for assault and battery by strangulation of his then-pregnant girlfriend while at Oklahoma State. Hunt went unclaimed on waivers and became a free agent after the video of then-19-year-old Abigail Ottinger from Berea, Ohio — the location of the Browns’ team facility — surfaced. Hunt, 23, is from the Cleveland suburb of Willoughby and spends a significant part of his offseason in the area. Following his college football at Toledo, he burst onto the scene as a third-round draft pick in 2017. Hunt rushed for 1,327 yards as a rookie. He had 824 yards through 11 games in 2018. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY SportsNEW YORK (Reuters) - Partly cloudy skies and a cool breeze did little to dampen the enthusiasm of fans packed into Flushing Meadows for the U.S. Open on Monday, where the sport’s biggest names were set to embark on their quest to win the year’s final Grand Slam. World number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic and French Open champion Ash Barty will take the court in the morning before five-times winner Roger Federer closes the night session on Arthur Ashe. The most anticipated match, however, was the first-round showdown between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, a pair of powerhouses who for years were the two most recognisable names in women’s tennis. Williams and Sharapova have never met at the U.S. Open before and although eighth seed Williams will be the favorite against the world number 87. Williams holds a commanding 19-2 career record against Russian Sharapova but the 37-year-old American’s fitness could be an issue. Seeking a record-tying 24th career Grand Slam title, Williams forced to withdraw from the Rogers Cup final in Toronto due to back spasms and sat out the Cincinnati Open this month.

The state carrier launched commercial flights on Wednesday, its first since it was liquidated in 2001, aiming to take a slice of the East African aviation business that is dominated by Ethiopian Airlines, the continent’s success story. Uganda is the latest African government to pour money into national flag carriers; Tanzania and Senegal are also resurrecting their airlines, while the likes of Rwanda, Ivory Coast and Togo are expanding theirs.  But such efforts have been hampered by high business costs as well as protectionism, which has impeded a continental open-skies agreement - something industry experts say is vital for the success of African carriers in a tough market.  The African market is forecast to grow almost 5% a year over the next two decades in terms of passengers, faster than mature markets, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). However, this is from a low base and most state-owned flag carriers in the region are losing money.  While the global aviation industry is on track to make a profit of $28 billion, African airlines are projected to make combined losses of $100 million this year, IATA said in June. Uganda Airlines, like some of its rivals, aims to attract more domestic travelers to help it buck the gloomy continental trend. Around 2 million passengers per year travel through Entebbe, Uganda’s main airport. Around 70% are Ugandans, said the carrier’s CEO Ephraim Bagenda.  “All those currently travel on foreign airlines,” he told Reuters. “We want part of that cake.”  CLOSED SKIES Last year, it looked like Africa was making progress on an open-skies agreement - the Single African Air Transport Market - to let airlines decide how frequently they fly between cities and which aircraft they use.  A total of 28 countries have signed up, accounting for 75-80% of African air traffic. Uganda is considering signing, Works and Transport Minister Monica Azuba Ntege said.  However, so far only 10 signatories - including Cape Verde, Ghana, Togo, Ethiopia and Nigeria - have begun changing their own laws to implement the deal and open up their markets, said Raphael Kuuchi, Vice President for Africa at IATA. The patchy efforts undermine the agreement and hobble direct connections within Africa, say analysts. Some airlines, including from countries that have signed up, oppose the open-skies deal because they fear bigger competitors. “The most subsidized airlines and the biggest ones are going to take the biggest market share because they (are) able to afford it,” Kenya Airways CEO Sebastian Mikosz told an investor briefing on Tuesday. “They are going to kill the smaller national airlines which are just starting because they will have no way to defend themselves.” Ethiopian Airlines, sub-Saharan Africa’s only successful large state-owned airline, has bucked the regional trend and has been expanding fast, thanks in part to having secured key traffic rights in two ways.  First, it signed bilateral agreements with nearly all African countries in the 1970s, activating them as needed, said Kuuchi. The airline flew to parts of the continent served by few other carriers and leveraged that goodwill to open up markets.  “Governments were willing to give them additional rights, and travel rights, once you give them out, it’s very difficult to retract,” he added. More recently, Ethiopian has been helping other countries launch their own carriers and taking a stake. That has created regional continental hubs in Togo, Malawi and Chad where it can pick up and feed traffic into its main hub in Addis Ababa, cementing its dominance and rivaling Gulf carriers. Now governments are hoarding travel rights to protect their own airlines, so African carriers are struggling to set up hubs vital to winning international travelers, said Girma Wake, former CEO of Ethiopian Airlines. “Instead of flying point-to-point everywhere, if they can collect traffic from the low-traffic areas and bring them to major hubs and carry them from those major hubs, you will be in a better position,” he told Reuters.  HIGH FUEL COSTS, TAXES African aviation accounted for only 2.1% of the global market in 2018, with 92 million passenger journeys flown, and non-African airlines including Emirates and Turkish Airlines account for around 80% of traffic in and out of the continent, IATA said.  African airlines are also struggling to improve load factors - percentage of seats filled - from the world’s lowest regional level of 71% in 2018, compared with 81.2% globally, according to IATA. Emirates builds traffic through its global Dubai hub, an advantage most African airlines don’t have - except Ethiopian Airlines. As well as protectionism, high fuel and taxation hurt African carriers.  In Europe, a passenger can travel 1.5 hours for less than $100 all-inclusive. In Africa, passenger taxes alone range from $40 to $150 per passenger, African Airlines Association Secretary General Abderahmane Berthe told Reuters. “Many governments are levying taxes on aviation and not reinvesting these collected amounts in aviation,” he said.  Governments often see air transport as a luxury that can sustain high taxes, said Air Tanzania managing director Ladislaus Matindi.  Fuel is also taxed heavily and must often be trucked in, an expensive operation. Fuel makes up about a quarter of operating costs globally but reaches 30-40% in Africa, Berthe said. Uganda Airlines, founded by former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, was liquidated in 2001 after years of unprofitability during a push to privatize state firms. Other African state carriers have been crippled by government interference, such as insisting on routes to unprofitable but politically important destinations.

A glowing red sky is seen in Kumpeh District in Muaro Jambi Regency, Indonesia in this still image obtained from a September 21, 2019 social media video. INSTAGRAM @DANI_KHOLIK via REUTERSThe Southeast Asian country has spent months battling fires, often caused by slash-and-burn farming practices, as an El Nino weather pattern exacerbates the annual dry season and helps create a haze across the region. Yunita, a resident who filmed the crimson sky on Saturday, said there had been “strong winds, and the smog was thick. The event lasted from noon until evening, breathing was quite hard on that day”. The event quickly went viral on social media, with one video notching up over 600,000 views on Instagram in three days.  In order for a red sky to occur aerosols must be present in the air, A. R. Ravishankara, a U.S.-based scientist was cited in an article posted on the website of Scientific American. Aerosols are solid or liquid particles suspended in air that can originate from both natural processes and human activity. The natural form can come from forest fires, dust kicked up by sandstorms, sea spray or volcanic eruptions, among other things. Indonesia’s meteorology agency said the sky had turned red in parts of Sumatra due to the “scattering  of sunlight by particles floating in the air, also known as Mie scattering”. The agency said that there had been very thick smoke in the  Muaro Jambi area of Sumatra last weekend with satellite analysis revealing many hot spots. “The smoke from the forest fire was different than other areas experiencing forest fires,” the agency said. The satellite showed some areas appeared brown but Jambi appeared white, indicating the smoke to be very thick,” the agency said, noting the fires were likely from highly flammable peat.     For some Indonesians, it was as mysterious as it was concerning.    “This is the earth not Mars. This is Jambi not outer space....We are humans who need to breathe clean air, not smoke,” said one Twitter user @zunishofiyn.

Alpine Skiing - FIS Alpine World Ski Championships - Men's Downhill - Are, Sweden - February 9, 2019 - Gold medalist Norway’s Kjetil Jansrud celebrates with his team mates. REUTERS/Leonhard FoegerThe 36-year-old Svindal, one of the greatest skiers of his generation, had to settle for the silver medal in the last race of his glittering career as Jansrud won by 0.02 seconds. It was a fitting end to a career which saw him win two Olympic golds, including the downhill last year, five world championships golds and twice win the overall World Cup title. “It’ll be special for Aksel in a sense — it’s almost symbolic,” American great Bode Miller said in his role as Eurosport’s chief analyst for the championships in Are. “He’s passed the torch on to Kjetil. “Jansrud is now the leader of that Norwegian team and I think that’s a real cool ending.” Despite the terrible race conditions, with minimal visibility and snow falling, Jansrud and Svindal managed to look a class apart from their rivals as they attacked the course in the fearless fashion the Norwegians have become known for. “I thought the top two really elevated the level of the race,” Miller said. “It was a day where it could have been a protected, easier day — no one can see anything out there and conditions are pretty tough. “I tip my hat to the top two, raise my glass, because they were in a class of their own. I haven’t seen Aksel ski with that level of intensity in quite some time, he skied like an animal today. Kjetil and Aksel did something really special today. “Aksel is a legend and will go down as that.” Svindal, who will quit with 80 World Cup podiums to his name, including 36 wins, said he had been determined to go out in spectacular fashion. “I thought it would be the right thing to do to give it a hell of a show,” he said.  “Last year, Kjetil and I did the same thing in the Olympics but I won the gold, so he deserves it today.” Jansrud, who won Super-G gold at the Sochi Olympics, is not exactly a new kid on the block at the age of 33. “Kjetil is nearly as old as I am so he will take over the dad character for sure!” Svindal, who has finally called it a day after persistent knee problems, said. “I think we have a cool team, we work hard on that too. How many days do you get like this every year? This is like one in a thousand, or one in a hundred. “You really have to make it a life worth living as a downhill skier. It’s been an emotional couple of weeks, and I was ready to get this over with to be honest and hammer it one last time and that’s it!

The operation included loading 2,000 cubic metres of LNG onto a small-scale tanker at the Singapore LNG (SLNG) Terminal, followed by an STS transfer to a receiving heavy-lift commercial vessel, Pavilion Energy said in a statement on Thursday. The use of LNG as a marine or bunker fuel has grown amid tightening regulations on global shipping emissions. “We strongly believe that LNG will become the worldwide fuel of choice for bunkering in the long term,” said Tan Soo Koong, chief executive officer of SLNG. “We are keen to work with all stakeholders and invest in infrastructure as necessary, to help grow LNG bunkering here,” Tan said. Pavilion Energy is a Singapore-based LNG company incorporated by state-owned Temasek Holdings to invest in clean energy. From 2020, International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules will ban ships from using fuels with a sulphur content above 0.5 percent - compared with 3.5 percent now - unless they are equipped to clean their sulphur emissions. Using LNG to power ships instead of traditional fuels like fuel oil or gasoil can reduce polluting emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides by 90 to 95 percent, according to industry estimates. Singapore is the world’s largest bunkering hub with sales of 49.8 million tonnes of fuel in 2018. Other major bunkering ports like Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also encouraged the use of LNG bunkers. In Rotterdam, demand for cleaner-burning LNG rose more than sixfold in 2018 to 9,500 tonnes, up from 1,500 tonnes in the year before.

The company expects a turnover of $3 billion next year with half the amount to come from its Europe portfolio after a recent acquisition and the rest from Singapore, Frederic Barnaud, Pavilion Energy’s group chief executive said in an interview. Pavilion, owned by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], does not publish annual accounts and declined to reveal last year’s turnover.  It is also aiming to increase its global headcount to about 150 people by next year, by adding 40 to 50 people in various functions such as finance, risk management, LNG trading and operations in its European headquarters of Madrid which it plans to open in January 2020.      The Madrid office follows its acquisition in June of Spanish energy company Iberdrola’s LNG assets, which doubled Pavilion’s portfolio and gave it access to European regasification terminals as well as Atlantic supplies. “(We will) build the global LNG business that is also anchored around three critical markets: Singapore, Spain and the UK where we will import LNG and then sell and trade the gas in the wholesale market, in hubs and large industrial customers,” he said.    Pavilion joins other Asian companies who are increasingly looking for more flexibility to buy and trade LNG amid uncertainty in climate policies as countries grapple with the dilemma of using cheaper coal versus the more typically expensive but cleaner gas option. BEING AGILE With new supply sources emerging from the United States and the majority of LNG demand centered in Asia, cargoes will have to be shipped from far and swapped around, which “requires specific competence”, Barnaud said. “We are not looking at extremely aggressive or taking excessive risk in the market, we are looking at being agile and reasonably balanced in our supply,” he said in his first interview since taking over the helm at Pavilion last year.  In Asia, Singapore will remain the center of Pavilion’s LNG market where it plans to leverage the city state’s geographical proximity to top buyers such as Japan and South Korea, and shipping flows.  The firm is in talks with LNG terminal operator Singapore LNG Corp (SLNG) to possibly extend its storage lease when the current one expires in March 2020, after about 2-1/2 years, Barnaud said.  It has also indicated its interest for a potential fifth LNG storage tank that SLNG is considering to construct, he added. The tank space would allow Pavilion to break up large cargoes into smaller ones for re-export to neighboring countries, he said. It is also developing LNG bunkering activities, in line with Singapore’s vision of becoming a hub for the cleaner alternative to shipping fuel.  Pavilion supplies natural gas for one-third of Singapore’s industrial requirements while in Spain, it will have about 3% to 5% of market share once its acquisition is complete. “Our profile has changed, we see that others are looking at us differently already.

The bulk of the investments, totaling about S$18 million, were directed at co-funding the construction of LNG-powered vessels including tug boats, Lim said.  The remainder was directed at developing the use of LNG in the marine refueling, also known as bunkering, sector.  These included S$6 million for the construction of two barges capable of supplying ships with LNG bunkers through ship-to-ship transfers, as well as S$2 million for the development LNG-bunker trucking facilities at the Singapore LNG (SLNG) Terminal.  The investments come ahead of growing pressures on the global shipping industry to reduce its emissions footprint and as new limits on the sulfur content of marine fuels come into effect from 2020. Using LNG to power ships instead of fuel oil or marine gasoil can reduce emissions of the pollutants nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide by 90 percent to 95 percent, according to industry estimates.

The agreement will allow Pavilion Gas the “rights to access tank capacity on a segregated basis” for storage and reload operations over the next two years, the firms said in a joint statement. The statement did not say how much capacity Pavilion was awarded. However, in February, SLNG announced it was offering 160,000 cubic meters of storage. “We will work closely with SLNG to facilitate multi-user access of the SLNG Terminal for LNG trading activities,” said Seah Moon Ming, CEO of Pavilion Energy and Pavilion Gas. Pavilion has recently announced a number of LNG deals in Singapore, which has designs on becoming Asia’s trading hub for the fuel. Pavilion Gas, along with Shell Eastern Petroleum, won the rights to supply Singapore with LNG in 2016, and is due to begin first imports under the contracts this year. Pavilion Energy, the parent company of Pavilion Gas, also performed Southeast Asia’s first truck-to-ship transfer of LNG in May, demonstrating that the city-state was ready to begin LNG bunkering operations.

Holdings, Inc. (Burger King) and its related entities as follows: 	
	
Burger King Capital Holdings, LLC (BKCH/Parent of Burger King Holdings, Inc.) 	
and Burger King Capital Finance, Inc. (BKCF/Financing Subsidiary) as Co-Issuers

--$798 million face value of 9.875% senior unsecured notes due 2018 at

At Dec. 31, 2011, the carrying value of BKCH's and BKCF's discount notes rated 	
by Fitch was $393.4 million. At Dec. 31, 2011, the carrying value of Burger King	
Corporation's debt, including capital leases, was approximately $2.7 billion. 	
	
The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Negative.	
	
Fitch expects to assign the following rating to the successor company after the 	
closing of the recently announced merger and going public transaction:	
	
Burger King Worldwide, Inc. (Parent Holding Co.)	
	
--Long-term IDR 'B-'.	
	
Rating Rationale and Triggers:	
	
The Positive Outlook is due to improvement in Burger King's credit metrics 	
during 2011 and Fitch's view that the firm is making meaningful progress 	
executing its business strategy. In addition to achieving its general and 	
administrative (G&A) cost reduction goals, Burger King is successfully 	
refranchising lower-margin company stores, expanding outside of North America, 	
and refining its brand image. 	
	
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, rent-adjusted leverage (defined as total debt 	
inclusive of the $393.4 million aggregate carrying value of 11% discount notes 	
at BKCH and BKCF plus 8 times gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rent) 	
was 5.9 times (x). Operating EBITDAR-to-interest expense plus gross rent was 	
2.1x and FFO (funds from operations) fixed charge coverage was 2.0x. Credit 	
metrics have improved since the firm was acquired by 3G Capital Partners, Ltd. 	
(3G) in October 2010 mainly due to the previously mentioned $107 million 	
reduction in G&A expenses over the past year. Rent-adjusted leverage following 	
the buy-out was nearly 7.0x. 	
	
Fitch believes Burger King's credit statistics could experience additional 	
improvement in the near term due to better operating performance and modest debt	
reduction. According to the terms of Burger King's credit agreement the firm is 	
required to use 25% of its annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined by the agreement)	
for debt repayment. Fitch estimates this mandatory debt pay down to be about $80	
million. Rent-adjusted leverage consistently below 6.0x, as Fitch expects, along	
with meaningful free cash flow (FCF) and stable operating performance could 	
result in an upgrade to ratings. 	
	
 	
	
The pace of deleveraging could be impacted by the reduction in EBITDA caused by 	
accelerated refranchising if there is not a corresponding reduction in debt 	
and/or rent expense. However, at Dec. 31, 2011, Burger King had $459 million of 	
cash which could be used for voluntary additional debt reduction. Should debt 	
reduction exceed the mandatory prepayment requirement, leverage could decline 	
faster than currently anticipated by Fitch. 	
	
Burger King's current ratings reflect its high financial leverage and private 	
equity ownership structure, which Fitch believes adds a level of uncertainty to 	
the firm's on-going financial strategy. Partially offsetting these negatives are	
Burger King's free cash flow generation and relatively stable royalty-based 	
franchise revenue. 	
	
Merger Transaction and Public Listing:	
	
On April 3, 2012, Burger King Worldwide Holdings, Inc. announced that it will 	
become a publicly traded entity via a business combination with Justice Holdings	
Limited (Justice). Under terms of the definitive agreement, 3G will receive $1.4	
billion of cash in exchange for 29% of its ownership in Burger King. Following 	
the merger with Justice, which is expected to close in about 60 days, the 	
combined entity will be incorporated in Delaware and renamed Burger King 	
Worldwide, Inc. 	
	
Fitch views the transaction as neutral to mildly positive from a credit 	
perspective. Burger King will have access to public equity capital which could 	
help accelerate the firm's growth strategy. However, the corporation is not 	
expected to receive any cash proceeds as a result of the merger and will remain 	
closely held with 3G retaining 71%. Based on Fitch's interpretation of Burger 	
King's credit agreement and the indenture for the 2018 and 2019 notes, 	
modification of the firm's ownership structure as described above should not 	
cause a change of control triggering event or require mandatory debt repayment. 	
	
Recovery Ratings:	
	
The 'RR1' Recovery Rating on Burger King's secured debt reflects Fitch's belief 	
that recovery prospects on these obligations would remain outstanding at 	
91%-100% if the firm were to file for bankruptcy protection or restructure its 	
balance sheet. Conversely, the 'CCC/RR5' rating on Burger King's 9.875% 2018 	
notes is due to Fitch view that recovery would be below average or in the 11% - 	
30% range in a distressed situation. 	
	
The 'CC/RR6' rating on BKCH's and BKCF's 11% discount notes due 2019 implies 	
recovery prospects of 10% or less in a distressed situation because the notes 	
are structurally subordinated to Burger King's debt. Unlike the discount notes, 	
Burger King's debt is guaranteed and was issued by the operating company which 	
holds the vast majority of the firm's $5.6 billion of assets. An upgrade in the 	
IDR of Burger King or related entities or greater than expected debt reduction 	
could result in one or more upgrades to issue level and Recovery Ratings 	
assigned to all of the aforementioned obligations. 	
	
Same-Store Sales and Operational Update:	
	
Burger King's global system-wide same-store sales (SSS) performance improved 	
during 2011 but trends in North America, which represents 67% of revenue and 66%	
of operating profit excluding corporate expenses, have remained weak. 	
System-wide SSS declined 0.5% during 2011 after declining 2.4% during the 	
comparable period in 2010. SSS performance in the U.S. and Canada, however, 	
remained especially weak at negative 3.4% in 2011 and negative 4.4% in 2010. 	
	
Efforts to turn around sales in North America involve changes to Burger King's 	
menu and marketing strategy. The firm has improved the quality of its French 	
fries and has introduced menu items with broader appeal such as its Chef's 	
Choice burgers, premium salads, specialty drinks, and soft serve ice cream. 	
Burger King has also increased spending on advertising which has become more 	
food-centric and focused on core assets such as its signature flame-grilled 	
cooking process. If the firm is successful with its execution and changes in the	
menu and marketing resonate with consumers, SSS trends in North America should 	
improve.	
	
 	
	
As previously mentioned, Burger King successfully achieved its target of $85 	
million - $110 million of annual G&A cost savings during 2011. The firm's 	
operating EBITDA margin improved to 25%, up from about 20% for the comparable 	
12-month period due to lower G&A and the refranchising of 45 units. Significant 	
additional G&A cost reductions are not anticipated. However, the firm's EBITDA 	
margin is expected to increase meaningfully following its recently announced 	
agreement with Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. (Carrols; NASDAQ: TAST). Commodity	
costs are also expected to become less of a headwind for the Burger King system 	
in 2012.	
	
Transaction with Carrols:	
	
On March 26, 2012, Burger King entered into an asset purchase agreement with 	
Carrols - the firm's largest franchisee in North America with 297 units at the 	
end of 2011. The arrangement entails the refranchising of 278 company-operated 	
stores and a commitment to remodel approximately 450 units in the brand's 20/20 	
image over the next three and a half years. The transaction will be margin 	
accretive because franchised units are more profitable than company-operated 	
stores due to lower overall operating cost at the corporate level. However, the 	
decline in company restaurant revenue and EBITDA give up associated with this 	
transaction has been factored into Fitch's expectations regarding rent-adjusted 	
leverage.	
	
The total consideration to Burger King will include a 28.9% equity interest in 	
Carrols and cash of approximately $15.8 million. Concentration of franchisees is	
viewed negatively by Fitch, but Burger King's ownership interest and 	
representation on Carrols' board partially mitigates this concern. While Carrols	
is an experienced operator, Burger King will be able to exercise greater 	
influence over the management of a large block of its restaurants in the U.S. 	
	
The Carrols transaction, which is expected to close later this year, is viewed 	
as consistent with Burger King's strategy of actively refranchising 	
company-operated restaurants. Once completed, Fitch estimates that the Burger 	
King system will be more than 92% franchised, up from 90% at Dec. 31, 2011. 	
Furthermore, the agreement reflects continued progress the firm is making to 	
help broaden its appeal to a more diverse demographic of consumers via the 	
re-imaging of its restaurants.	
	
Liquidity and Maturities:	
	
As mentioned previously, Burger King had $459 million of cash at Dec. 31, 2011. 	
Excluding about $15 million of letters of credit, the firm also had $136 million	
of availability on its revolver. Burger King's liquidity is adequate and is 	
further supported by its consistent generation of meaningful FCF. Fitch believes	
Burger King has the capacity to generate over $200 million of FCF annually but 	
does not expect the firm's cash balance to remain at elevated levels. 	
	
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt are manageable with $28 million due 	
annually through 2015. Burger King's term loans amortize at a rate of 0.25% 	
quarterly with the balance payable at maturity on Oct. 19, 2016. Burger King's 	
9.875% senior unsecured notes become due Oct. 15, 2018, and BKCH's and BKCF's 	
11% discount notes mature April 15, 2019. 	
	
The discount notes are currently not guaranteed by Burger King, as mentioned 	
previously, but cash required to service the notes will be funded with 	
distributions from Burger King. This is because BKCH and BKCF have no operations	
or assets other than their interest in Burger King. The discount notes are also 	
cross-defaulted to Burger King's debt resulting in a greater incentive for the 	
operating company to service them.	
	
Financial Covenants:	
	
Burger King's credit agreement subjects the company to maximum total leverage, 	
not adjusted for leases, and minimum interest coverage financial covenants. 	
Maximum leverage was 7.50x in 2011 but declines by 0.25x annually to 6.0x in 	
2016. Minimum interest coverage was 1.70x at Dec. 31, 2011 but increases to 2.0x	
by Sept. 30, 2014. Fitch estimates that Burger King's leverage, as calculated by	
its agreement, was 4.4x at Dec. 31, 2011 providing the company with 	
approximately 40% EBITDA cushion. EBITDA headroom under the minimum interest 	
coverage test is also believed to be considerable at over 40%. 	
	
Both the 9.875% notes and the 11% discount notes contain change of control and 	
equity clawback provisions should the company engage in equity offerings prior 	
to Oct. 15, 2013. Given the voluntary nature of any equity clawback and the 	
structure of the merger with Justice, Fitch has not incorporated any debt 	
reduction associated with these notes into its expectations.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

At Dec. 31, 2012, Burger King had approximately $3 billion of total debt.

The Rating Outlook is Positive.

Rating Rationale:
The upgrade of Burger King's ratings is due to the firm's operating income
growth, declining financial leverage, and improving brand image which should
support positive future same-store sales (SSS) performance. Burger King is
successfully executing its stated business strategy which includes improving its
North American business, becoming nearly 100% franchised, and accelerating
international expansion, mainly via franchisees or master franchisee joint
ventures (JVs). Global net restaurant growth was 3.9% or a total of 485
restaurants during 2012.

Global SSS have been positive for six consecutive quarters and were 3.2% for the
2012 year, a stark improvement versus a decline of 0.5% during 2011. Burger
King's expanded line of premium burgers, smoothies, chicken strips, and salads
along with promotions such as the 55-cent anniversary WHOPPER celebration helped
drive traffic during 2012.

Income from operations increased 15.2% to $418 million while EBITDA grew 11.5%
to $652 million in 2012. Burger King's EBITDA margin of 33.2% for 2012, up from
25% in 2011, is benefiting from an accelerated pace of refranchising lower
margin company-operated restaurants, reduced general and administrative expenses
(G&A) and higher royalty income. Burger King was 97% franchised at Dec. 31, 2012
and expects to be nearly 100% franchised by the end of 2013.

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 4.7x and
total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR was approximately 5.4x. Cash flow from
operations totaled $224 million and FCF (cash flow from operations less capital
expenditures and dividends) was $140 million.

Fitch projects that rent-adjusted leverage will fall below 5.0x in 2013 due
mainly to EBITDA growth. Fitch also believes Burger King has the capacity to
generate $150 million or more of FCF annually due to lower capital expenditure
requirements once fully franchised. Fitch views this level of FCF as meaningful
for a company with Burger King's revenue base and debt structure. Total revenue
for 2012 was $2 billion and, as mentioned previously, total debt was $3 billion.

Positive Outlook:
The Positive Outlook is due to deleveraging expectations over the
near-to-intermediate term, Fitch's view that Burger King's North America
operations will continue to improve, and the fact that the company is laying a
solid foundation for faster international growth. Operating EBITDA during 2013
will be supported by controlled management general and administrative expenses
(G&A), same-store sales growth, and additional franchisee fees and royalties as
units are developed. Burger King expects to spend $200 - $220 million annually
on a go-forward basis on G&A overhead, is tweaking its barbell menu pricing
strategy to increase its competitiveness during 2013, and sees further
accelerated international net restaurant growth in 2013.

Term loan amortization, as discussed below, will result in only modest debt
reduction over the near term. Burger King currently plans to refinance its
higher coupon debt in the 2014/2015 time period. The firm's 9.875% notes due in
2018 and 11% discount notes due 2019 are subject to a make whole payment until
Oct. 15, 2014 and April 15, 2015, which makes calling these notes uneconomical
prior to late 2014.

Key Rating Drivers:
Declining Leverage and Meaningful Cash Flow Generation
Burger King's rent-adjusted leverage has declined from nearly 7.0x to
approximately 5.0x following the October 2010 leveraged buy-out by 3G Capital
Partners, Ltd. The improvement has been due to the positive impact of reduced
G&A expenses and SSS growth on operating income and cash flow. Selling, general,
and administrative expenses declined to $346 million in 2012 from $417 million
in 2011 and as mentioned previously global SSS increased 3.2% versus a decline
of 0.5% in 2011.

Additionally, a growing percentage of franchised units, which provide
high-margin royalty-based revenue, are improving Burger King's ability to
generate more stable operating cash flow. Lower capital expenditures as
franchisees fund remodeling and new unit growth along with a modest common
dividend should also support discretionary FCF. Burger King expects capital
expenditures to decline to $30 - $40 million in 2013, from $70 million in 2012,
and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.05/share resulting in an approximate
$70 million annual cash outflow for 2013.

Same-Store Sales (SSS) Growth and Net New Unit Development
SSS performance and net new unit growth are important rating drivers for Burger
King's credit ratings, as they are a key indicator of the health of the Burger
King system. As a fully franchised entity, these business statistics are
expected to provide insight on operating earnings and cash flow trends. Fitch
believes premium menu items such as the recently launched Avocado and Swiss
Whopper, a new improved coffee platform, value-oriented promotions, and limited
time offers to drive transactions will support SSS performance during 2013,
although the firm will lap strong comparisons in the first half. Moreover,
master franchise JV agreements established during 2012 should support meaningful
new unit development in markets including Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America,
and South Africa during 2013.

North American Operations
Improvement in Burger King's North America operations is a key factor in Fitch's
ratings as the region represented 63% of Burger King's $751 million of adjusted
EBITDA excluding unallocated management general and administrative expenses and
58% of the firm's 12,997 system wide restaurants in 2012. Fitch views Burger
King's progress related to its four pillar strategy - Menu, Marketing, Image,
and Operations - for North America positively as the company is experiencing
improvement in guest satisfaction and is gradually broadening its customer base
to include more women and customers over the age of 50.

Burger King's reorganized field organization and new mandatory on-line training
for operators should improve store-level operations and strengthen its
relationship with franchisees. Furthermore, recent refranchising agreements have
been structured to include required remodeling, solidifying the firm's ability
to reach its goal of having 40% of its North America system remodeled by 2015.
At Dec. 31, 2012, the Burger King system had reimaged 19% of its 7,476 units in
the U.S. and Canada, an improvement from 11% at the beginning of 2012.

Recovery Ratings:
The 'RR1' Recovery Rating on Burger King's secured debt reflects Fitch's belief
that recovery prospects on these obligations would remain outstanding at
91%-100% if the firm were to file for bankruptcy protection or restructure its
balance sheet. Collateral for this debt includes a perfected first-priority
security in interest in substantially all of Burger King's and each guarantor's
assets including intangible assets, subject to certain exceptions. Conversely,
the 'B+/RR4' rating on Burger King's 9.875% 2018 notes is due to Fitch view that
recovery would be average or in the 31% - 50% range in a distressed situation.

The 'B-/RR6' rating on BKCH's and BKCF's 11% discount notes due 2019 implies
recovery prospects of 10% or less in a distressed situation. These notes are
structurally subordinated to debt issued by Burger King Corporation because they
are not guaranteed and were not issued by the operating company which holds the
vast majority of the firm's $5.6 billion of assets at Dec. 31, 2012.

Liquidity and Maturities:
Burger King has consistently maintained good liquidity. At Dec. 31, 2012, the
firm had $547 million of cash and at Sept. 30, 2012, $118.5 million of revolver
availability net of letters of credit. Liquidity is supported by the firm's FCF,
which Fitch projects can average at least $150 million annually as mentioned
previously.

Maturities are manageable in the intermediate term and consist mainly of term
loan amortization payments through 2018. Beginning Dec. 31, 2012, Burger King's
new term loan A amortizes at a rate of $6.4 million per quarter, stepping up to
$12.9 million on Dec. 31, 2013, $19.3 million on Dec. 31, 2014, $25.8 million on
Dec. 31, 2015, and $32.2 million on Dec. 31, 2016 with the balance payable at
maturity. The new term loan B amortizes in quarterly installments equal to 0.25%
of original principal with the balance due at maturity.

Financial Covenants:
Burger King's credit agreement subjects the firm to maximum total leverage, not
adjusted for leases, and minimum interest coverage financial maintenance
covenants. Maximum leverage, excluding up to $450 million of cash, is 6.25x
beginning Dec. 31, 2012, stepping down to 6.0x March 31, 2013 through June 30,
2013, 5.75x Sept. 30, 2013 through March 31, 2014, 5.25x June 30, 2014 through
June 30, 2015, and 5.0x thereafter. Minimum interest coverage is 1.7x beginning
Dec. 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013 increasing to 2.0x after June 30, 2015. Burger
King should maintain good cushion under these covenants as current metrics are
well within these parameters.

Following the end of the fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31, 2012 and thereafter,
Burger King is required to use 50% of its annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined by
the agreement) for term loan repayment if total leverage is greater than 4.5x.
The requirement declines to 25% if total leverage is less than 4.5x but greater
than 3.5x or 0% if total leverage is less than 3.5x. Fitch anticipates that
Burger King will not be required to make an excess cash flow payment in 2013.

Rating Sensitivities
Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive
rating action include:

--Material additional deleveraging; such that total adjusted debt-to-operating
EBITDAR falls below the 4.5x range, along with continued strong FCF could result
in an upgrade in Burger King's ratings;
--Sustainably strong SSS performance, particularly in North America, would be
required for additional upgrades.

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative
rating action include:

--A downgrade in the near term is not anticipated given Burger King's improved
leverage profile, good liquidity, and lack of near-term maturities;
--However, a meaningful increase in leverage, due to increased debt or a
prolonged period of SSS declines, increased covenant risk, and negligible FCF
could result in a downgrade in ratings.

--$1,480.7 million secured term loan due 2016 'BB-/RR1';
--$235.1 million secured Euro tranche term loan due 2016 'BB-/RR1'.

At June 30, 2012, Burger King had $3.1 billion of total debt.

The Rating Outlook is Positive.

Rating Rationale:

The upgrade of Burger King's ratings is due to the company's declining financial
leverage, improving same-store sales (SSS) performance, and good cash flow
generation. Burger King's cash flow and margins are benefiting from general and
administrative (G&A) expense savings, significant refranchising, global SSS
growth, and international new unit development by franchisees. Cash flow from
operations (CFO), which totaled $343 million for the latest 12-month (LTM)
period ended June 30, 2012, more than satisfies Burger King's decreasing capital
expenditure requirements resulting in meaningful annual free cash flow (FCF).

Burger King's consolidated EBITDA margin has expanded to over 27% for the LTM
period ended June 30, 2012 from more than 25% at Dec. 31, 2011. At June 30,
2012, 94% of Burger King's 12,604 units were franchised, an increase from 90% at
Dec. 31, 2011. Burger King is succeeding with its goal of being a fully
franchised business. Fitch expects Burger King's EBITDA margin to experience
considerable additional expansion as a result of the financial effect of
refranchising.

The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's belief that Burger King's leverage will
continue to decline over the next 12 months from a combination of modest EBITDA
growth and moderate debt reduction. Coverage ratios should also improve as a
result of the firm's September 2012 credit facility refinancing discussed below.
Burger King is required to utilize a percentage of its excess cash flow (as
defined by the firm's credit agreement and as discussed below) for the repayment
of term loans.

Recent Same-Store Sales Improvement and Credit Metrics:

Burger King's global SSS grew 4.5% during the first six months of 2012, after
declining 2.5% for the same period last year. Comparable sales growth in North
America - which represented 67% of revenue and 66% of operating income excluding
corporate expenses during 2011 - was 4.3% during the first half of 2012 versus a
decline of 5.6% during the same period last year. Burger King has enhanced the
quality of its food and is broadening its appeal to a wider demographic with an
expanded line of premium burgers, smoothies, chicken strips, and salads. Fitch
believes good systemwide operational execution and continued remodeling of units
will enable Burger King to continue to generate positive SSS. Burger King has
reported improving guest satisfaction scores and, as of June 30, 2012,
franchisees had completed or have committed to re-image about 30% of its 7,469
units in North America.

For the LTM period ended June 30, 2012, rent-adjusted leverage (defined as total
debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rent) was 5.5x. Leverage
is down from nearly 7.0x following the October 2010 leveraged buy-out by 3G
Capital Partners, Ltd. Operating EBITDAR-to-interest expense plus gross rent was
2.1x, funds from operations (FFO) fixed-charge coverage was 2.0x, and FCF was
$262.6 million for the LTM period. Fitch believes Burger King's FCF has the
potential to approximate $200 million or more in most years, as a highly
franchised model is less capital intensive and the firm does not pay a regular
common dividend.

Refinancing of Secured Credit Facility:

On Sept. 28, 2012, Burger King entered into a new secured credit facility
consisting of a $130 million revolver expiring Oct. 19, 2015, a $1,030 million
tranche A term loan due Sept. 28, 2017, and a $705 million tranche B term loan
due Sept. 28, 2019. Proceeds were used to refinance the firm's existing secured
credit facility. As a result of the refinancing, Burger King lowered borrowing
rates and extended the maturity dates of its term loans which were due in 2016
under the old agreement. Burger King expects to achieve annual cash interest
savings of $25 million from the recent refinancing of its secured credit
facility.

Recovery Ratings:

The 'RR1' Recovery Rating on Burger King's secured debt reflects Fitch's belief
that recovery prospects on these obligations would remain outstanding at
91%-100% if the firm were to file for bankruptcy protection or restructure its
balance sheet. Conversely, the 'B/RR4' rating on Burger King's 9.875% 2018 notes
is due to Fitch's view that recovery would be average or in the 31%-50% range in
a distressed situation.

The 'CCC+/RR6' rating on Burger King Capital Holdings, LLC's and Burger King
Capital Finance, Inc.'s 11% discount notes due 2019 implies recovery prospects
of 10% or less in a distressed situation. These notes are structurally
subordinated to debt issued by Burger King Corporation because they are not
guaranteed and were not issued by the operating company which holds the vast
majority of the firm's $5.4 billion of assets at June 30, 2012.

Liquidity and Maturities:

Burger King has consistently maintained good liquidity. At June 30, 2012, the
firm had $377.7 million of cash and $138.5 million of revolver availability net
of letters of credit. Liquidity is supported by the firm's FCF, which Fitch
believes can average at least $200 million annually as mentioned previously.
Maturities are manageable in the intermediate term and consist mainly of term
loan amortization payments through 2018. Beginning Dec. 31, 2012, Burger King's
new term loan A amortizes quarterly at a rate of $6.4 million, stepping up to
$12.9 million on Dec. 31, 2013, $19.3 million on Dec. 31, 2014, $25.8 million on
Dec. 31, 2015, and $32.2 million on Dec. 31, 2016 with the balance payable at
maturity. The new term loan B amortizes in quarterly installments equal to 0.25%
of original principal with the balance due at maturity.

Financial Covenants:

Burger King's new credit agreement subjects the firm to maximum total leverage,
not adjusted for leases, and minimum interest coverage financial maintenance
covenants. Maximum leverage is 6.25x beginning Dec. 31, 2012, stepping down to
6.0x March 31, 2013 through June 30, 2013, 5.75x Sept. 30, 2013 through March
31, 2014, 5.25x June 30, 2014 through June 30, 2015, and 5.0x thereafter.
Minimum interest coverage is 1.7x beginning Dec. 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013,
increasing to 2.0x after June 30, 2015. Burger King should maintain ample
cushion under these covenants as current metrics are well within these
parameters.

Following the end of the fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31, 2012 and thereafter,
Burger King is required to use 50% of its annual excess cash flow (as defined by
the agreement) for term loan repayment if total leverage is greater than 4.5x.
The requirement declines to 25% if total leverage is less than 4.5x but greater
than 3.5x, or 0% if total leverage is less than 3.5x. Fitch estimates that total
leverage, which as defined by the company's new credit facility is based on
total debt of the borrower and restricted subsidiaries less up to $450 million
of cash, was about 3.6x at June 30, 2012.

What Could Trigger A Rating Action

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive
rating action include:

--Material additional deleveraging; such that total adjusted debt-to-operating
EBITDAR approximates 5.0x or lower, along with continued good FCF could result
in an upgrade of Burger King's ratings;
--Sustainably strong SSS performance, particularly in North America, and stable
to improving EBITDA margins would be required for additional upgrades.

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative
rating action include:

--A downgrade in the near term is not anticipated given Burger King's improved
leverage profile, good liquidity, and lack of near-term maturities;
--However, a meaningful increase in leverage, due to increased debt or a
prolonged period of SSS declines, increased covenant risk, and negligible FCF,
could result in a downgrade.

Bruce Hicks, a company spokesman, said on Friday that AMR Corp would discontinue retiree life insurance and would end medical coverage for those over 65. That group would, instead, have access to a Medicare supplement at their own cost. Retirees under 65 would still have access to company plans, but at their own expense as well, Hicks said. AMR asked a New York bankruptcy judge to declare that it has the right to alter company-funded retiree benefits because they were never vested. American’s retiree health plans cover more than 40,000 people. In the filing, American argued that it would be required to maintain company-provided benefits only if it had promised to provide those benefits for life. AMR made no such promises, and explicitly reserved its right to modify its retiree benefit plans, it said. “The restructuring process is difficult for everyone affected, and we understand any changes to these benefits are concerning to our retirees,” Hicks said. A lawyer for a committee of retired workers did not respond to requests for comment. Other U.S. airlines reduced retiree health plans while in bankruptcy and eliminated or changed pension plans as well to save money. American sought bankruptcy protection in November, citing high labor costs. AMR has said it must save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in labor costs, and has sought to achieve those savings through concessions from workers, including unionized pilots, flight attendants and ground workers. Unions, livid over those demands, are supporting an effort by US Airways to merge with AMR, a prospect the unions say could salvage some jobs and benefits. AMR said it had $1.25 billion in retiree health and welfare liability as of 2010. The proposed cuts to retiree benefits are very similar to previously proposed changes that would affect current workers who retire in the future.

A worker walks underneath an American Airlines airplane at Miami International airport in Miami, Florida November 29, 2011.   REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe proposal, which would avert the largest pension default in U.S. history, could move the third-largest U.S. airline a step closer to consensual deals with its major unionized work groups as its struggles to slash uncompetitive labor costs. AMR, which filed for Chapter 11 on November 29, had been the only major airline to avoid bankruptcy in the last decade and is the only one that still has traditional, or defined benefit, pensions, the company said. “Freezing the defined benefit pension plans would mean that employees would retain the full value of benefits accrued for service prior to the date the plan is frozen,” said Jeff Brundage, AMR’s senior vice president of human Resources, in a letter to employees. “Freezing instead of terminating these plans of course would mean we will have significantly larger pension costs than contemplated in our business plan,” Brundage said. AMR has said it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion, including $1.25 billion in labor costs. AMR said it still must achieve the labor savings target and it would seek new capital to cover the incremental annual costs of funding frozen pensions. AMR said in letters to employees that the pension proposal does not extend to its pilots because their plan includes provisions for a costly lump sum payout to retiring workers that other work groups do not have. “Given the number of pilots who are eligible to retire, the company would be at significant operational risk if we emerge from Chapter 11 with a frozen plan that allows pilots to retire with a lump sum benefit,” Brundage said. AMR still wants to terminate the pilots’ plan unless it can get the lump sum matter resolved. The Allied Pilots Association said in a letter to members that it would ask them to waive the lump sum option in the plans that feature it so that those pensions can be frozen as well. “Our plan is the only one on the AMR property that includes the option of a lump sum and our experts have concluded that attempting to preserve a lump-sum option is not achievable,” APA President David Bates said. VICTORY FOR PENSION INSURER AMR said in February that it would seek bankruptcy court approval to terminate traditional pension plans covering 130,000 workers and retirees. Those plans would be replaced with 401(k) plans with a company match. Employer-financed defined benefit plans provide a fixed payout over time and are historically more generous than the 401(k) or other cash plans that mix employee and employer contributions that are more common today. Traditional pensions are often still found in heavily unionized industries such as airlines, autos and aerospace. AMR’s pensions covering pilots, flight attendants and ground workers were underfunded by an estimated $10 billion when the company filed for bankruptcy. Underfunding is the difference between the assets in a plan and the amount of future obligations. United Airlines had the largest pension default in the United States at nearly $9 billion underfunded. The decision is a victory for U.S. pension insurers, who waged a public campaign against plans by American to cancel its pensions in bankruptcy. “Bankruptcy forces tough choices, but that doesn’t mean pensions must be sacrificed for companies to succeed. We will continue to work with American and the other participants in the bankruptcy to ensure that success,” Josh Gotbaum, director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, said in a statement. The agency reported a record deficit of $26 billion in 2011 and is responsible for payouts to 1.5 million people. It paid more than $5 billion in benefits last year. In many cases, retirees get less in benefits when the government takes over the pensions of bankrupt companies. The Transport Workers Union, which represents many of the ground workers at AMR, cheered the plan, saying an earlier proposal to terminate pensions was “totally unacceptable.” “I have to say that I do consider it a win because terminating is not an option,” TWU President James Little told Reuters. “I think that would have been the most devastating.” He said that while TWU would rather keep its pension plans intact, a freeze is more palatable and advances the union’s goal of reaching a deal with AMR. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants said on its website that it has not responded to AMR’s proposal and that it was “meeting internally to evaluate the proposal.” American has almost 74,000 full- and part-time employees and its regional carrier American Eagle has about 14,000 full- and part-time employees. The company has been leaning on its labor unions to agree to concessions. Should AMR and its unions be unable to reach consensual deals, AMR could ask the bankruptcy judge to abrogate existing labor deals and allow the company to impose new terms.

A US Airways plane and an American Airlines plane share a terminal at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington April 23, 2012. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueAmerican’s parent company, AMR Corp AAMRQ.PK, worked out the $11 billion merger with US Airways as part of a plan to exit bankruptcy, where it has been since 2011. Judge Sean Lane had been expected to approve the plan at a hearing on Thursday. But, two days before the hearing, the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher fares and hurt consumers. Instead of approving the plan, Lane gave AMR and its creditors until August 23 to submit briefs on how he should proceed. Lane said he needed more information about the appropriateness of approving the restructuring plan in light of the antitrust challenge. AMR and US Airways, which have said they will fight the antitrust lawsuit, and their lawyers argued on Thursday that Lane should still approve the bankruptcy plan. A lawyer for US Airways, Daniel Wall, said the Justice Department’s timing, just two days before the final hearing, was “audacious.” “Don’t allow the bankruptcy issues, which are complicated enough on their own, to be held hostage to very late-filed antitrust issues,” Wall told the judge. But Lane cited “lingering doubts” about the benefits of approving a bankruptcy plan before the antitrust issue is resolved. “What would be the point of entering a confirmation order ... if, in fact, there’s a lot more work to be done?” he said. Under the restructuring plan, a reorganization cannot go ahead without antitrust approval for the merger, which could take months. If the Justice Department ultimately succeeds in blocking the merger, it would put AMR’s restructuring back at square one, requiring it to forge new strategies for paying back creditors. AMR shareholders, who stand to receive a 3.5 percent stake in the new entity under the merger, would likely be wiped out under any plan that excludes a merger, restructuring experts have said. Lane said he had strongly considered canceling Thursday’s hearing but decided to give parties an open forum to discuss the antitrust challenge. The bankruptcy plan has the support of nearly all of AMR’s key creditors, and Lane had already signed off on the merger and an initial outline of the restructuring plan that incorporates it. Absent the antitrust challenge, Thursday’s hearing would have been the final step in AMR’s exiting bankruptcy and implementing its merger.

In a strongly worded labor negotiations update, the third-largest U.S. airline said it must make major changes to its contracts and that it does have the “luxury of time.” “As the company laid out in its February 1 restructuring announcement, we must make major changes to our labor agreements. And we need those changes in a matter of weeks,” the carrier said. AMR filed for Chapter 11 protection on Nov. 29, citing uncompetitive labor costs after years of fruitless talks with its unions. The carrier says it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion. The carrier dismissed requests for buyouts from unions representing its flight attendants and many ground workers, saying the proposals “represent a significant cost to the company and could not be accepted on their terms.” Unlike its top rivals United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, AMR did not restructure in bankruptcy in the last 10 years. Instead, it reorganized out of court, relying on its workers for voluntary concessions. United and Delta, however, emerged stronger from bankruptcy, later found merger partners and leapfrogged AMR in size. Those airlines are profitable now while AMR is not. AMR posted a net loss of net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. The president of the Transport Workers Union told Reuters in an interview this month that it will offer alternatives to some of the job cuts and concessions the company says it needs to survive and that the union needs more details on how AMR arrived at its cost-savings targets.

The move came after AMR agreed to preserve potential clawback claims relating to debt deals, struck between Marathon and AMR, that left American Airlines with $2.26 billion of debt. AMR entered bankruptcy last November, and is considering its options for emerging either as a standalone firm or to merge with smaller competitor US Airways Group, which is making an aggressive takeover push. Marathon, which has said it holds “well over” $100 million of AMR debt, last month sought an examiner to probe intercompany transactions consummated in the weeks before AMR’s Chapter 11 filing. The deals transferred about $2.26 billion of debt from AMR’s American Eagle unit to American Airlines. Marathon said in court papers it was concerned that potential legal claims to claw the money back would be barred under the language of a separate settlement, under which AMR refinanced about 200 of its aircraft. AMR dismissed that argument in court filings as an “obvious litigation tactic.” But on Thursday, it agreed to expressly preserve such claims in exchange for Marathon dropping its request for an examiner, AMR attorney Richard Hahn said at the hearing in federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y.. The resolution also allows AMR to move forward with the underlying aircraft refinancing deal, which it says will save about $670 million on planes manufactured by Embraer. Marathon has been taking a more vocal role in AMR’s bankruptcy, adding another layer of complexity to the already multi-faceted case. The examiner request was Marathon’s second attempt to flex its muscles as a significant creditor, coming days after it sent a letter to AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton demanding more transparency about the airline’s restructuring efforts. It remains unclear whether Marathon supports a standalone restructuring or a US Airways merger, or whether Marathon would be in a position to finance an independent exit from bankruptcy for AMR. But as a large debtholder, the hedge fund could be in a position to influence either scenario by objecting to plans it does not support. US Airways would like to acquire AMR out of bankruptcy, while a group of debtholders including JPMorgan Chase & Co  has expressed interest in financing a standalone exit. AMR received court permission at Thursday’s hearing to extend for 30 days, through Jan. 28, its unilateral control of its bankruptcy exit plan. That means US Airways cannot propose its own takeover plan until that date, and that any merger plan before that date would have to be a cooperative effort with AMR. Labor issues will also affect AMR’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy independently. High labor costs were a driving force in the company’s bankruptcy filing, and while the airline has reached new collective bargaining deals with its flight attendants’ and ground workers’ unions, it remains at odds with its pilots. That could spook investors assessing the company’s stability going forward, and AMR’s creditors’ committee has said labor peace with pilots is a top priority. While AMR and its pilots continue to negotiate, the pilots have said they support a merger with US Airways. They have also said they already have a tentative labor deal in place with US Airways.

TWU has asked American’s parent company AMR Corp  for details on how it arrived at the cost-savings targets it unveiled this month when it said it planned to eliminate 13,000 jobs and terminate pensions. Union president James Little told Reuters in an interview the union hopes to draw on the labor deals it struck with the company prior to the Nov. 29 bankruptcy filing to salvage some of those jobs. “It’s irresponsible for us to take those numbers for granted and not do our own analysis,” Little said. AMR said it was aiming for $2 billion in total annual cost reductions, including $1.25 billion in employee-related expenses. American, the third-largest U.S. airline, said it may eliminate 13,000 jobs as part of its restructuring. About 9,000 of those workers are members of the TWU, which had already negotiated contracts or tentative labor deals for four of the seven work groups it represents at AMR when the company filed for Chapter 11. Little said the TWU is waiting for financial information from the company so it can either challenge the cost-savings targets or suggest alternatives to help AMR reach its targets in a way that makes the cuts more palatable to its members. “We would like to reach a consensual agreement,” Little said, adding that he expected other labor unions also to offer alternatives to the AMR’s plan. The airline has presented non-public details of its restructuring plan to members of its creditors committee. Labor unions representing pilots, flight attendants and groundworkers, have three of the nine seats AMR presented to creditors. Any reorganization plan would require approval from AMR’s bankruptcy court judge. AMR restructured out of court nearly 10 years ago, while several of its rivals like United Airlines and Delta Air Lines slashed costs with Chapter 11 protection. Those two airlines emerged from Chapter 11 stronger, went on to find merger partners and now earn profits while AMR posts losses. AMR, meanwhile, relied on voluntary concessions during its last reorganization but now complains its labor costs are higher than its competitors. American said it lost $10 billion over the past decade and financed the red ink with debt. The period was marked mainly by industry downturns triggered by the 2001 hijack attacks, recession, and skyrocketing fuel prices.

AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, said on Tuesday it eliminated five senior jobs as part of its restructuring and that its lead labor strategist would step down. REUTERS/Frank PolichThe cuts, combined with the previously announced departure of other managers, represents a “20 percent reduction in the company’s most senior leadership positions,” AMR said in a statement. An AMR spokeswoman said eight or nine management jobs had been cut so far. AMR filed for bankruptcy in November, citing a need to slash uncompetitive costs. The company has said it intends to cut its overall costs by $2 billion a year. More than half of that amount will come from labor costs. “Redesigning the organization will help accelerate our progress toward profitability and success,” said AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton in a letter to employees. “Every step increases our clarity of purpose and helps speed decisions in the interest of best serving our customers.” Among the five departing executives are David Brooks, American’s President - Cargo, and Susan Garcia, American’s Vice President - Information Technology. In the same statement, AMR said Jeff Brundage, who is AMR’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources, has been replaced in his role by Denise Lynn, who will carry the job title Senior Vice President - People. The company did not say why Brundage was replaced. He will not immediately leave the company. “For now, I’m not going anywhere and will continue to work with many of you on the needed changes,” he said. Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former AMR executive, said Brundage’s departure is ironic amid the ongoing labor clash between AMR and its management. As AMR overhauls its management team, the airline is battling its unions in court over its request to void their labor contracts if workers do not willingly make the concessions the company says it needs to survive. American has been locked for years in fruitless negotiations with its three labor unions, which represent pilots, flight attendants and several classifications of ground workers. The airline won steep concessions from labor in 2003 as it dodged bankruptcy at the time. The carrier has about 74,000 full- and part-time workers. The company has said it must cut 13,000 union jobs. Against this backdrop, rival airline US Airways Group is hoping to jumpstart merger talks with AMR, which so far has shrugged off the interest. To further that goal, US Airways last month struck deals with AMR’s unions, which say US Airway’s plan save more jobs than AMR could through its stand-alone plan. The unions each have seats on AMR’s creditors committee, meaning they have a say in how AMR exits bankruptcy. For now, however, the carrier has the exclusive right under bankruptcy law to reorganize without interference from outsiders. The airline says it still hopes to reach consensual deals with its workers. AMR has presented what it calls its last and best offer to the Transport Workers Union, which represents 26,000 workers in seven work groups American Airlines. A TWU spokesman on Tuesday said information on AMR’s offer will be sent by mail to members this week with voting set to begin next week. American Airlines is the third-largest U.S. airline. It had been the only major U.S. airline to avoid Chapter 11 in the last decade, a factor that gave rivals a cost advantage.

Organizers Extinction Rebellion have called for non-violent civil disobedience to force the British government to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025 and stop what they call a global climate crisis. The protests did not cause major travel disruption on Friday during one of Britain’s biggest holiday weekends, but police said they have now arrested more than 682 people. Extinction Rebellion blocked several locations in central London this week after staging a semi-nude protest in parliament earlier this month. “Our planet is in serious trouble,” Thompson told reporters amid a crowd of about 300 activists, according to eye witnesses. She addressed them from a pink boat in the middle of London’s Oxford Circus as shoppers and tourists milled past. “We are here in this island of sanity and it makes me so happy to be able to join you all and to add my voice to the young people here who have inspired a whole new movement,” said Thompson, one of Britain’s most acclaimed actresses who has won two Academy awards. She was one of several actors who read poems celebrating the beauty of nature. The activists formed a human chain around the boat, with one attached to its main mast making it extremely difficult for the police to dislodge him.  After a painstaking operation, they removed him and secured the boat, but had difficulty transporting the vessel away because more protesters continually sat in their path. “The serious disruption the demonstrations are causing to people in London and beyond is unacceptable and we completely understand the concern it is causing to those who are disrupted by it,” police said in a statement.

Watson, Murad and women’s rights leaders from more than 20 countries have identified nearly 80 “good practices” in gender equality law pertaining to violence, economic empowerment, education, health and discrimination. The nearly 40-strong Gender Equality Advisory Council will  press their case to the Group of Seven member countries, which include Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Italy and Canada, at their annual meeting. “The Council expresses great concern about the persistent, and even growing, threats and backlash against girls’ and women’s rights in many countries,” it said in recommendations published this week ahead of the summit. The council, formed in 2018 under then-G7 leader Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and renewed by French president Emanuel Macron, also condemned “the considerable responsibility of some political leaders in this step backwards.” Watson, a fellow advisory member who has been a vocal advocate for women’s rights as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador and active member of Time’s Up, has used her star power to galvanize public discussion on gender equality. “The G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council has a simple first step for #genderequality: Ditch discriminatory laws and adopt laws that lift up girls and women,” the “Harry Potter” star  wrote on Instagram to more than 51 million followers. The council’s recommendations call on G7 countries to make political and economic advances for women within their own countries but also a centerpiece of foreign policy, encouraging other countries to follow suit. The G7 countries comprise more than 10% of the world’s population and over 40% of its wealth. “We have the evidence that a gender equal world is healthier, wealthier, more productive and more peaceful,” Katja Iversen, the president and CEO of Women Deliver told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Thursday. “We call on them not just to do it right in their own countries, but to use their political and financial power to push the rest of the world.”  Iverson pointed to past successes such as Rwanda’s 2003 decision to implement a 30% quota on female elected officials as a progressive move with lasting effect. Today the government is over 60% female. The council’s recommendations also call on countries to address physically and economically harmful practices like child marriage, inheritance laws that prevent men leaving wealth to their wives and weak domestic violence laws. Its call to action implored leaders not only to usher in new laws, but to see them enforced, measure their progress and be transparent about the results. Macron’s official recommendation to G7 leadership will be for each country to adopt at least one new progressive law by next year, a bar Iversen hopes to see exceeded. “We’re seeing progress, but also pushback, and we need to push back against the pushback,” she said.

Today’s example is provided by the Washington Post Co and its flagship paper (and the online site Slate). The company reported third quarter earnings including results from its newspaper division today. Print advertising revenue fell 20 percent to $57.6 million — quite a stunning plunge even  as newspapers across the U.S. manage to post quarter after quarter of print ad revenue declines. Even more disturbing is that online revenue, which includes washingtonpost.com and Slate, plunged 14 percent to $23.3 million. Display online ad revenue dropped 17 percent. The Washington Post is one of those curious oddities in the industry that manages to be extremely local — it’s market penetration of the D.C. area has always been one of the highest in the U.S. — and also draws the interest of a large national audience. So while it may compete with the “nationals” i.e. New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, on the news front,  it is very dependent on local advertising. The NYT, USAT and WSJ get a hefty portion of their advertising revenue through national advertisers. The local advertising category hasn’t been holding up as well as national advertising. It’s taking it on the chin as the housing market struggles, unemployment remains high and retail outlets are going out of business or simply taking their advertising elsewhere. That’s not to say that national advertising revenue isn’t hurting as well.  It’s more of a mixed bag. At the New York Times, for example, the division that mainly includes its flagship paper reported advertising revenue fell 6 percent to $156.1 million in Q3. Gannett, which publishes USAT, used to give some information on how that paper was doing by reporting paid ad pages, but the company ceased — to use the parlance of research analysts — to provide more color on the USAT front. Instead, Gannett reports that national advertising,  including USAT, fell 17 percent. USAT represents a big chunk of Gannett’s national advertising. The Wall Street Journal manages somehow to defy these trends. Ad revenue rose 13 percent in the third quarter– that includes print and online –  according to a memo from Dow Jones’ top executive Todd Larsen to employees.   Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Courtesy of Mandy Meloon/Handout via REUTERSWhen she first complained about being sexually abused by Jean Lopez, then the team’s head coach, USA Taekwondo officials said the claims were false slurs that damaged morale, and Meloon was soon suspended from the team. Lopez and his siblings were the sport’s most prominent family, bringing home Olympic gold medals. Lopez did not respond to Reuters’ emails and requests for comment left with staff at his taekwondo studio in Las Vegas, nor did his lawyer respond. Previously Lopez has denied inappropriate sexual contact with Meloon, now 37, and two other athletes who have accused him. After Meloon’s suspension, she struggled for years with money and mental health issues. In 2016, she began serving a two-year prison sentence after assaulting an off-duty Texas sheriff’s deputy who was trying to remove her from a bar after an employee asked her to leave. But in April, a report from a new investigatory body found “a preponderance of the evidence” showing Meloon, along with fellow athletes Heidi Gilbert and Kay Poe, had told the truth in their years-old accusations against Lopez. Lopez was permanently banned from the sport, a decision he is appealing. “I think all of us owe them big thank you’s,” Brandon Meek, a former director on USA Taekwondo’s board, said of Meloon and two other women who accused Lopez.  Gilbert told Reuters that reading the report made her feel “numb.” Poe, through her lawyer, declined to be interviewed by Reuters.   Meloon was once dismissed as a troublemaker, having spoken up long before the recent wave of reckonings for powerful men in media, politics and sport accused of sexual abuse and the ensuing #MeToo movement empowering victims to come forward. Now she is seen by some in the sport as a trailblazer and a case study in the potential consequences of ignoring those who come forward with complaints of abuse.  “I know she’s had a rough time,” said Steve McNally, who became USA Taekwondo’s director last year. “I hope she can put this behind her, and if I can help with this at all I’d be glad to.” He said he could not comment on Lopez while his appeal was under way.  PARALLEL TO GYMNASTICS CASE Meloon’s experience is similar in some ways to the abuse of young female gymnasts by Larry Nassar, the doctor for the U.S. national gymnastics team who is spending the rest of his life in prison after scores of his victims testified in nationally televised court hearings earlier this year.  Meloon said the abuse began at age 13, when Lopez frequently engaged her in uncomfortable discussions about sex as soon she started training with him at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado. In 1997, when she was 16, Lopez, then in his early 20s, drunkenly crawled into bed with her and engaged in inappropriate contact during a trip to Cairo, she said. She won a World Cup silver medal on that trip. A few months after she filed a written complaint in 2006, USA Taekwondo officials suspended Meloon ahead of the Olympic Games in Beijing, saying Meloon had “wrongfully accused” coaches of soliciting her for sex. “These defamatory utterances are untrue and damaging to the morale of the national team and USAT staff and coaches,” their report said. They also said Meloon smoking and drinking alcohol excessively and was refusing to train. Her athletic career abruptly over, Meloon says she struggled alone, sometimes homeless or in psychiatric wards, sometimes working in construction or restaurants, having forsaken even a high-school diploma during her rise as a teenage athlete. Toward the end of her prison sentence, Meloon saw the first sign of shifting public sentiment on sexual assault. An investigator from the U.S. Center for SafeSport, set up last year to investigate sexual misconduct in Olympic sports, met her in August to review her complaint.  When she was released in January, she started hearing from former teammates and coaches about #MeToo. “I come out of prison and people are calling me and are like, ‘We believe you, we support you! Yay! #MeToo!’” Meloon, who now lives in Austin, Texas, said in a telephone interview. “I’m like: Where were y’all 11 years ago?”  FILE PHOTO: Jean Lopez, brother and coach to U.S. taekwondo exponent Steven Lopez, celebrates after his brother won a gold medal at World Taekwondo Championships in Madrid, Spain April 15, 2005.

REUTERS/Ammar AwadJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian driver they said had carried out a car-ramming attack on Friday that injured two Israeli civilians in the occupied West Bank, one of them critically. Reuters journalists at the scene saw police rolling the body of the driver into a plastic sheet. Palestinian health authorities identified him as a Palestinian national. An Israeli police spokesman said an officer who had been near the scene opened fire after the attacker rammed his car into people by the roadside near the Israeli settlement of Elazar, close to the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service said one of the Israelis, 17, was unresponsive and “in severe condition with multisystem trauma” and that the other, 19, had sustained moderate injuries.  Dozens of Israeli troops and medics were at the scene. The alleged attacker’s vehicle, which bore Israeli license plates which allow greater freedom of movement in both Israel and the West Bank, was overturned by the roadside. Police said the attacker had been driving along a road which weaves past Palestinian towns and Israeli settlements.  Palestinians carried out a wave of car-rammings in the West Bank in late 2015 and 2016, but the frequency of such incidents has since ebbed.  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Two Palestinian youths stabbed an Israeli policeman in Jerusalem’s Old City on Thursday and were shot by officers, killing one of them. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down in 2014.

Israeli policemen and soldiers inspect a damaged house that was hit by a rocket north of Tel Aviv Israel March 25, 2019. REUTERS/ Ammar AwadThe early morning attack on Mishmeret, an agricultural town north of Tel Aviv, came at a time of high tension ahead of the anniversary of Gaza border protests at the weekend, and with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visiting Washington as he campaigns for a fifth term in an April 9 ballot.  Israel’s commercial capital and outlying communities had last come under such an attack during the 2014 war with Gaza’s dominant Hamas Islamists.  The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating six occupants of a home in Mishmeret, including an infant, for  wounds. TV images showed a building with extensive damage, and police said it had also been set aflame. The strike came minutes after the Israeli military activated air raid sirens in the area and said one rocket had been launched out of the Gaza Strip, a coastal territory 50 miles (80 km) away where Hamas and other factions possess such weapons.   Emmanuel Nahshon, spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, said the home in Mishmeret was hit by a rocket from Gaza.  There was no immediate Palestinian confirmation. Two rockets were launched at Tel Aviv on March 14 but caused no casualties or damage, Israel said. It blamed the rocket launches on Hamas, though a security official who declined to be identified by name or nationality later said that the salvo, which missed any built-up areas, had been set off by accident. There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu on Monday’s incident. His chief rival in next month’s election, centrist ex-general Benny Gantz, issued a statement accusing the rightist premier of having “bankrupted national security”.

Israeli forces gather at the scene of an attack near the Jewish settlement of Dolev in the Israeli-occupied West Bank August 23, 2019. REUTERS/Ammar AwadThe family were visiting a spring in a popular hiking area when an improvised explosive device (IED) blew up, the Israeli military and paramedics said. The military said it was being treated as a terrorist attack. It was not immediately clear if the device had been planted in advance or thrown. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service confirmed that 17-year-old Rina Shnerb had died at the scene and said her father and brother - named by Israeli media as Rabbi David Eitan, 46, and 21-year-old Dvir - were in serious condition. A large crowd of mourners gathered later on Friday for the teenager’s funeral in her home town of Lod, where her body was covered in a white shroud adorned with the Star of David. “This is insane, everything that’s happening here. I still can’t believe it,” said Shnerb’s sister Tamar. “Only yesterday you were here, joyful as always, you were happy and made everyone happy, as you always do.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to the family, and said security forces were pursuing the attackers. “The long arm of Israel reaches all those who seek our lives,” Netanyahu said in a statement, adding: “We will continue to strengthen settlement. We will deepen our roots and strike at our enemies.” The hilly central region of the West Bank around the settlement of Dolev lies northwest of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, and is studded with olive groves and orchards. The area saw clashes last year between Palestinians and Israelis, as Palestinian villagers complained that settlers were trying to take over land, including water sources. On Friday morning, the Israeli military quickly cordoned off the area around the Ein Bobin spring near the Palestinian village of Deir Ibzi’ while soldiers set up checkpoints on roads and searched the area. An Israeli student, Danny Gonen, was killed at the same spring in 2015 in an attack claimed by a group that said it was affiliated with the Islamist group Hamas. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised the latest attack but did not claim responsibility for it, warning Israel not to “assault our Jerusalem and our sacred sites”. In a speech in Gaza he said: “I bless this operation and I greet the hands of those who executed it. I pray for God to protect those who stood behind it. Regardless of who they are, they are Palestinians.” David Friedman, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, tweeted that he was “heartbroken and outraged”. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Jason Greenblatt, urged the Palestinian Authority to “unequivocally condemn” the attack.

REUTERS/Suhaib SalemCross-border hostilities which broke out on Friday flared into a second day, with Palestinians fleeing Israeli strikes in Gaza and air-raid sirens sending Israelis running to shelters as interceptor missiles blew up rockets in the sky.     The escalation, which comes just ahead of both the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Israel’s Independence Day holiday, prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to convene  security chiefs.  Egyptian mediators, credited with brokering ceasefires in previous rounds of violence, were working to prevent further hostilities. The latest round of violence began on Friday when a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers, according to the Israeli military.  Israel retaliated with an air strike that killed two militants from the armed Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Two other Palestinians protesting near the frontier were killed by Israeli forces on the same day, Palestinian officials said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad began firing waves of rockets into Israel early on Saturday. The Israeli military said its tanks and aircraft responded with strikes against more than 120 militant targets belonging to both groups. Explosions shook Gaza City, where busy streets were packed with shoppers preparing for Ramadan. The Gaza Health Ministry said a 14-month old baby, her pregnant mother and another man were killed by Israeli strikes and at least 20 other Palestinians were wounded. Residents identified two of them as militants.      “The Israeli plane fired a missile near the house and the shrapnel entered the house and hit the poor baby,” said her aunt, Ibtessam Abu Arar.  The Israeli military Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, questioned whether the baby was killed in an air strike.  “According to indications, the infant and her mother were killed as a result of Palestinian terrorist activities and not as a result of an Israeli raid,” he said on Twitter, without providing further details.  Two multi-storey buildings in Gaza City were destroyed by Israeli raids. One, the Israeli military said, housed Hamas’s intelligence and security offices. The other housed Islamic Jihad facilities, Palestinian sources said.  Witnesses said the Israeli military had warned people inside to evacuate the buildings before they were bombed. One of them  also housed the office of the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency. Ankara condemned the strike.       A small armed pro-Hamas group in Gaza, the Protectors of Al-Aqsa, said one of its men was killed in another air strike.  Related CoverageTurkey calls international community to act on 'disproportionate actions' by IsraelThe Magen David Adom ambulance service said two Israelis were wounded by shrapnel.  TRUCE EFFORTS Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said Israel was prepared to intensify its attacks. He added that Islamic Jihad was trying to destabilize the border and blamed Hamas for failing to rein it in.  Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the rocket barrages were a response to Friday’s events and that Israel has been delaying the implementation of previous understandings brokered by Cairo. In a joint statement, Hamas and Islamic Jihad said: “Our response will be broader and more painful if the enemy pursues its aggression.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli actions in Gaza. Hamas said on Thursday that its Gaza chief, Yeyha Sinwar, had traveled to Cairo for talks on efforts to maintain calm along the border and alleviate hardship in the enclave.  “Egypt has stepped up its efforts with Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and Israel, but there is no conclusion yet,” said a Palestinian official familiar with Cairo’s mediation efforts.  The United Nations has also been part of the Cairo talks.  “The United Nations is working with Egypt and all sides to calm the situation,” said U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov. “This endless cycle of violence must end and efforts must accelerate to realize a political solution to the crisis in Gaza.” “The United States strongly condemns the ongoing barrage of rocket attacks by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Saturday.   Although aerial exchanges are frequent, Israel and Hamas have managed to avert all-out war for the past five years.  Israel is due to host the 2019 Eurovision song contest finals in less than two weeks in Tel Aviv, towards which long-range rockets were launched in mid-March.     Some 2 million Palestinians live in Gaza, whose economy has suffered years of blockades as well as recent foreign aid cuts. Unemployment stands at 52 percent, according to the World Bank, and poverty is rampant. Israel says its blockade is necessary to stop weapons reaching Hamas, with which it has fought three wars since the group seized control of Gaza in 2007. Slideshow (14 Images)Over the past few weeks, Cairo’s mediation had helped persuade Israel to lift some restrictions on the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza and expand the Mediterranean zone where Gazans can fish. But Israel scaled back the fishing zone this week in response to rocket fire and shut the border crossings entirely on Saturday after barrages from Gaza.

Israeli media reports said the assailant was shot by a fellow resident of the Adam settlement, which lies between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah. There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials.   Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Palestinian Gaza Strip, praised the attack. Its spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, said it was a “heroic and brave operation that came in response to the daily, ugly crimes conducted by the Israeli occupation against our people.” Israeli-Palestinian tensions have surged in the past few months.  At least 140 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli fire in weekly border demonstrations. Israel says Hamas is using the protests as cover for a cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this. Palestinian militants have in recent weeks fired hundreds of rockets into Israel from Gaza and have opened fire at Israeli troops across the border, killing one soldier and drawing fatal Israeli air and tank strikes.     Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by the U.S. administration to restart them has so far shown little sign of progress. Palestinians want to establish a state in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005, annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and maintains control over more than half the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule. Most countries consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal. Israel disputes this.

Olsen shareholder proposes name change to Dolphin Drilling,"OSLO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The biggest shareholder in Fred. Olsen Energy on Thursday proposed changing the company’s name, days after it blamed the latest oil price plunge for the collapse of a rig sale deal to raise money to cut debts. The company, controlled by one of Norway’s richest families, the Olsens, has been trying to restructure debts of about $580 million and the refinancing plan included the sale of its newest rig Bolette Dolphin. But the plan to sell Bolette Dolphin for $340 million failed after a buyer pulled out of the talks, the company said on Tuesday. “The potential buyer of the Bolette Dolphin has withdrawn from the sales process given the significant change in oil and equity prices coupled with the uncertainty around the restructuring and sale process,” Fred. Olsen said at the time. Oil services companies like Fred. Olsen have borne the brunt of a downturn in the oil industry where oil companies had to cut spending to cope with a fall in oil prices. An oversupply of oil rigs added to the oil services industry’s pain by lowering day rates for rig hire. A number of Fred. Olsen’s rivals have been forced out of business or had to restructure. The oil price has since recovered, with North Sea oil hitting a four-year high of $86 per barrel in October, boosting rig owners’ hopes that oil companies will start spending again to replenish reserves. But in less than two months, oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel on concerns about a supply glut. The price drop also comes at the time of year when oil companies usually plan next year’s budgets. Rival drilling rig firm Seadrill , which emerged from U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July, has downplayed the impact of the recent oil market plunge. “The recent volatility in oil crisis has little bearing on how the vast majority of our customers invest. Their time horizon is much longer,” Seadrill Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz said during an earnings call on Tuesday.” Both Seadrill and Fred. Olsen Energy said in their outlooks that a broad rig market recovery has been taking place, and prices should rise next year. On Thursday, Fred. Olsen called an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Dec. 20 to approve a proposal to change its name to Dolphin Drilling, the name associated with large finds on the Norwegian continental shelf, including the country’s largest gas field Troll. The proposal came from its major shareholder Bonheur , an investment company of the Olsen family, which also has investments in renewable energy, cruise shipping, and media. The company was not immediately available to comment on the reason for the proposed name change. Fred. Olsen Energy also owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that built the RMS Titanic.

Olsen Energy proposes to issue new equity in restructuring,"OSLO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred. Olsen Energy, proposes to sell one of its drilling units and to issue $130-140 million in new equity to pay off debt, as part of a refinancing plan published on Tuesday. The proposal includes issuing about $90 million in new loan capital, paying $580 million to settle outstanding secured debt, and converting bond debt into equity. Existing shares of the company will represent approximately one percent of the share capital after the restructuring. The shares, which have fallen 99 percent over the last five years, closed down 25 percent. Last month, Fred. Olsen (FOE) said it was edging closer to a deal to solve the company’s financial situation, and warned that the deal could require new equity, amendments to the company’s bank and bond facilities, and sale of assets. The refinancing plan calls for the company to sell its Bolette Dolphin drilling unit. Fred. Olsen owns the Harland & Wolff yard in Northern Ireland that build the RMS Titanic. “FOE will continue its discussions with its key stakeholders with the aim of securing the necessary support for its implementation, and note that the proposal remains subject to change following such discussions,” the company said. “Following such refinancing, Fred Olsen will continue as a four drilling unit company (including Blackford Dolphin, Bideford Dolphin, Borgland Dolphin and Byford Dolphin),” it added. Fred. Olsen stopped paying its creditors in July to preserve liquidity, making it the latest victim of a slow recovery in the oil and gas exploration sector.

Since the start of 2017, over 20 U.S. retailers, including Sears Holdings Corp (SHLDQ.PK) and Toys ‘R’ Us, have filed for bankruptcy, succumbing to the onslaught of fierce e-commerce competition from Amazon Inc (AMZN.O). Fred’s, which has been making losses since 2015, has been trying to turn around its business. In April, it said it would close at least 159 underperforming and unprofitable stores, or nearly 30% of its total outlets.  “Despite our team’s best efforts, we were not able to avoid this outcome,” Chief Executive Officer Joe Anto said. The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.  Fred’s said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.  It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.  Shares of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company, which have lost nearly all their value since the company was forced to scrap its bid for 1,200 Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) stores in June 2017, plunged to 15 cents in early trading.

Olsen Energy edges closer to financial restructuring,"OSLO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Norwegian drillship and rig operator Fred. Olsen Energy, owner of the yard that built the RMS Titanic, is considering a debt and equity restructuring that would almost wipe out the value of its current shares, the company said. With debt and liabilities of more than $840 million at the end of June, Fred. Olsen last month stopped paying its creditors to preserve liquidity, making it the latest victim of a slow recovery in the oil and gas exploration sector. The owner of seven drillships and rigs, as well as Belfast’s Harland & Wolff yard, has now received indicative, non-binding proposals from equity investors valuing its current shares and bonds at just $10 million, it said in a statement. The company’s largest owner, Bonheur, which holds a 51.9 percent stake, separately said it had not decided whether to take part in the proposed refinancing. Fred. Olsen’s shares traded 15.9 percent lower in Oslo at 5.70 Norwegian crowns by 0804 GMT. The company has a 1.025 billion Norwegian crown ($124.63 million) bond maturing in February 2019, while bank debt of $611 million falls due the following year. “The deal implies conversion of bonds to equity and partial conversion of bank debt,” Chief Executive Ivar Brandvold told Reuters. The proposal would also secure an infusion of new equity financing and establish a “solid financial platform” for Fred. Olsen Energy to continue its operations, the firm said, although negotiations were still ongoing and no deadline had been set. Any deal would require approval from holders of the company’s bonds. In July, rig operator Seadrill emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after restructuring debts and liabilities of more than $10 billion.

British media reported that United will pay Shakhtar about 52 million pounds ($70 million) for the 25-year-old. “This is the biggest club in the world and I am delighted to be a part of this amazing team,” Fred told United’s website. “To work with (manager) Jose Mourinho, who has won so many trophies in his time as a coach, is an opportunity not to be missed. “I cannot wait to get started and to meet my new team-mates. I would like to thank everyone at Shakhtar Donetsk for everything they have done for me over the past five years.” Fred is in the Brazil World Cup squad, but was an unused substitute for the 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game. Fred will compete for a midfield place with Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic next season as United aim to challenge champions Manchester City for the Premier League title. “Fred will complement our other midfielders’ qualities, which we need; his creative brain and passing vision will give us another dimension to our game,” Mourinho said. Fred won three Ukrainian league titles with Shakhtar after joining from Brazil’s Internacional in 2013. United also signed Portuguese full back Diogo Dalot from Porto this month.

Brazil team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari reacts during a news conference held after a team soccer training session at the national stadium in Brasilia ahead of their 2014 World Cup Group A soccer match against Cameroon June 22, 2014.    REUTERS/Ueslei MarcelinoCoach Luiz Felipe Scolari’s first move when he took over the side 18 months ago was to field a target man, a role which had fallen out of favor under his predecessor Mano Menezes. However, Brazil, who could previously call on the likes of Ronaldo, Careca and Romario, are suffering from a dearth of center-forwards and Scolari is dependent on out-of-form Fred and Jo at the World Cup. Scolari initially handed the role to Luis Fabiano is his first match in charge against England in February last year and replaced him with former Olympique Lyon striker Fred at halftime. Fred, now at Fluminense, immediately impressed, scoring Brazil’s goal in a 2-1 defeat, and kept the role for last year’s Confederations Cup, where he finished as joint top-scorer with five goals to help Brazil win the title. Shortly afterwards, the 30-year-old, who played at the 2006 World Cup, suffered a long-term injury and spent the run-up to the World Cup trying to regain his form. Scolari, wanting to remain loyal to the Confederations Cup squad, reassured Fred that he remained the first choice. However, Fred has not refound last year’s form and his cause was not helped by the poor standard of opposition in the season-opening Carioca (Rio de Janeiro state) championship. Central defender Thiago Silva said Fred, who won a controversial penalty against Croatia but was ineffective in the 0-0 draw against Mexico, should not be judged by the number of goals he scores. “Fred is still an important player for our team and he doesn’t have to score every game,” said Thiago Silva. “His job is to participate and if he can help the team by opening up space for Neymar and other players to score, we will all be happy. “He doesn’t have to worry about scoring, he has to think about the team, the group and he is quite unruffled because the same thing happened in the Confederations Cup. “I am sure that he will start scoring goals in any case. It will be the same story as the Confederations Cup, when he didn’t score in the first two games.” “I’m sure that tomorrow (Monday) he will score a goal and take this weight off his shoulders, of course a striker lives by goals and I’m with him.” Brazil play Cameroon in their final Group A game on Monday needing a point to progress.

FILE PHOTO: Nov 19, 2018; Los Angeles, CA: Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt (27) celebrates scoring in the second quarter against the Los Angeles Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY SportsHunt, a Pro Bowl pick as a rookie in 2017 on his way to a repeat in 2018 with the Kansas City Chiefs, is currently on the exempt list while the NFL investigates an assault captured on video last February. The incident prompted his immediate release by the Chiefs in November. Hunt would become a restricted free agent in March 2020, which is significant because the Browns would retain rights of first refusal if another team signs Hunt to an offer sheet. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported on air Monday that Hunt was facing a “10 or 12 game” suspension and could even be suspended for the “majority or the entire 2019 season.” The Browns also have Nick Chubb, a second-round pick in 2018, at running back. Browns general manager John Dorsey drafted Hunt out of Toledo and has been in contact with him during an ongoing suspension. “My relationship and interaction with Kareem since 2016 in college was an important part of this decision making process but we then did extensive due diligence with many individuals, including clinical professionals, to have a better understanding of the person he is today and whether it was prudent to sign him,” Dorsey said in a statement. “There were two important factors: one is that Kareem took full responsibility for his egregious actions and showed true remorse and secondly, just as importantly, he is undergoing and is committed to necessary professional treatment and a plan that has been clearly laid out.” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during his Super Bowl week address that the league hoped to finish an investigation — and render any decision on discipline — very soon. Hunt issued a statement Monday after the deal became official. “First off, I would like to once again apologize for my actions last year. What I did was wrong and inexcusable,” Hunt said. “That is not the man I was raised to be, and I’ve learned a great deal from that experience and certainly should have been more truthful about it after the fact. I’m extremely grateful that John Dorsey, Dee and Jimmy Haslam and the Cleveland Browns organization are granting me the opportunity to earn their trust and represent their organization in the best way possible on and off the field. I am committed to following the necessary steps to learn and to be a better and healthier person from this situation. I also understand the expectations that the Browns have clearly laid out and that I have to earn my way back to the NFL. I’m a work in progress as a person, but I’m committed to taking advantage of the support systems that I have in place to become the best and healthier version of myself.” Dorsey has shown a willingness to align with players with skeletons in their closet in the past, including drafting wide receiver Tyreek Hill despite a serious guilty plea for assault and battery by strangulation of his then-pregnant girlfriend while at Oklahoma State. Hunt went unclaimed on waivers and became a free agent after the video of then-19-year-old Abigail Ottinger from Berea, Ohio — the location of the Browns’ team facility — surfaced. Hunt, 23, is from the Cleveland suburb of Willoughby and spends a significant part of his offseason in the area. Following his college football at Toledo, he burst onto the scene as a third-round draft pick in 2017. Hunt rushed for 1,327 yards as a rookie. He had 824 yards through 11 games in 2018. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The state carrier launched commercial flights on Wednesday, its first since it was liquidated in 2001, aiming to take a slice of the East African aviation business that is dominated by Ethiopian Airlines, the continent’s success story. Uganda is the latest African government to pour money into national flag carriers; Tanzania and Senegal are also resurrecting their airlines, while the likes of Rwanda, Ivory Coast and Togo are expanding theirs.  But such efforts have been hampered by high business costs as well as protectionism, which has impeded a continental open-skies agreement - something industry experts say is vital for the success of African carriers in a tough market.  The African market is forecast to grow almost 5% a year over the next two decades in terms of passengers, faster than mature markets, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). However, this is from a low base and most state-owned flag carriers in the region are losing money.  While the global aviation industry is on track to make a profit of $28 billion, African airlines are projected to make combined losses of $100 million this year, IATA said in June. Uganda Airlines, like some of its rivals, aims to attract more domestic travelers to help it buck the gloomy continental trend. Around 2 million passengers per year travel through Entebbe, Uganda’s main airport. Around 70% are Ugandans, said the carrier’s CEO Ephraim Bagenda.  “All those currently travel on foreign airlines,” he told Reuters. “We want part of that cake.”  CLOSED SKIES Last year, it looked like Africa was making progress on an open-skies agreement - the Single African Air Transport Market - to let airlines decide how frequently they fly between cities and which aircraft they use.  A total of 28 countries have signed up, accounting for 75-80% of African air traffic. Uganda is considering signing, Works and Transport Minister Monica Azuba Ntege said.  However, so far only 10 signatories - including Cape Verde, Ghana, Togo, Ethiopia and Nigeria - have begun changing their own laws to implement the deal and open up their markets, said Raphael Kuuchi, Vice President for Africa at IATA. The patchy efforts undermine the agreement and hobble direct connections within Africa, say analysts. Some airlines, including from countries that have signed up, oppose the open-skies deal because they fear bigger competitors. “The most subsidized airlines and the biggest ones are going to take the biggest market share because they (are) able to afford it,” Kenya Airways CEO Sebastian Mikosz told an investor briefing on Tuesday. “They are going to kill the smaller national airlines which are just starting because they will have no way to defend themselves.” Ethiopian Airlines, sub-Saharan Africa’s only successful large state-owned airline, has bucked the regional trend and has been expanding fast, thanks in part to having secured key traffic rights in two ways.  First, it signed bilateral agreements with nearly all African countries in the 1970s, activating them as needed, said Kuuchi. The airline flew to parts of the continent served by few other carriers and leveraged that goodwill to open up markets.  “Governments were willing to give them additional rights, and travel rights, once you give them out, it’s very difficult to retract,” he added. More recently, Ethiopian has been helping other countries launch their own carriers and taking a stake. That has created regional continental hubs in Togo, Malawi and Chad where it can pick up and feed traffic into its main hub in Addis Ababa, cementing its dominance and rivaling Gulf carriers. Now governments are hoarding travel rights to protect their own airlines, so African carriers are struggling to set up hubs vital to winning international travelers, said Girma Wake, former CEO of Ethiopian Airlines. “Instead of flying point-to-point everywhere, if they can collect traffic from the low-traffic areas and bring them to major hubs and carry them from those major hubs, you will be in a better position,” he told Reuters.  HIGH FUEL COSTS, TAXES African aviation accounted for only 2.1% of the global market in 2018, with 92 million passenger journeys flown, and non-African airlines including Emirates and Turkish Airlines account for around 80% of traffic in and out of the continent, IATA said.  African airlines are also struggling to improve load factors - percentage of seats filled - from the world’s lowest regional level of 71% in 2018, compared with 81.2% globally, according to IATA. Emirates builds traffic through its global Dubai hub, an advantage most African airlines don’t have - except Ethiopian Airlines. As well as protectionism, high fuel and taxation hurt African carriers.  In Europe, a passenger can travel 1.5 hours for less than $100 all-inclusive. In Africa, passenger taxes alone range from $40 to $150 per passenger, African Airlines Association Secretary General Abderahmane Berthe told Reuters. “Many governments are levying taxes on aviation and not reinvesting these collected amounts in aviation,” he said.  Governments often see air transport as a luxury that can sustain high taxes, said Air Tanzania managing director Ladislaus Matindi.  Fuel is also taxed heavily and must often be trucked in, an expensive operation. Fuel makes up about a quarter of operating costs globally but reaches 30-40% in Africa, Berthe said. Uganda Airlines, founded by former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, was liquidated in 2001 after years of unprofitability during a push to privatize state firms. Other African state carriers have been crippled by government interference, such as insisting on routes to unprofitable but politically important destinations.

A glowing red sky is seen in Kumpeh District in Muaro Jambi Regency, Indonesia in this still image obtained from a September 21, 2019 social media video. INSTAGRAM @DANI_KHOLIK via REUTERSThe Southeast Asian country has spent months battling fires, often caused by slash-and-burn farming practices, as an El Nino weather pattern exacerbates the annual dry season and helps create a haze across the region. Yunita, a resident who filmed the crimson sky on Saturday, said there had been “strong winds, and the smog was thick. The event lasted from noon until evening, breathing was quite hard on that day”. The event quickly went viral on social media, with one video notching up over 600,000 views on Instagram in three days.  In order for a red sky to occur aerosols must be present in the air, A. R. Ravishankara, a U.S.-based scientist was cited in an article posted on the website of Scientific American. Aerosols are solid or liquid particles suspended in air that can originate from both natural processes and human activity. The natural form can come from forest fires, dust kicked up by sandstorms, sea spray or volcanic eruptions, among other things. Indonesia’s meteorology agency said the sky had turned red in parts of Sumatra due to the “scattering  of sunlight by particles floating in the air, also known as Mie scattering”. The agency said that there had been very thick smoke in the  Muaro Jambi area of Sumatra last weekend with satellite analysis revealing many hot spots. “The smoke from the forest fire was different than other areas experiencing forest fires,” the agency said. The satellite showed some areas appeared brown but Jambi appeared white, indicating the smoke to be very thick,” the agency said, noting the fires were likely from highly flammable peat.     For some Indonesians, it was as mysterious as it was concerning.    “This is the earth not Mars. This is Jambi not outer space....We are humans who need to breathe clean air, not smoke,” said one Twitter user @zunishofiyn.

It was a fitting end to a career which saw him win two Olympic golds, including the downhill last year, five world championships golds and twice win the overall World Cup title. “It’ll be special for Aksel in a sense — it’s almost symbolic,” American great Bode Miller said in his role as Eurosport’s chief analyst for the championships in Are. “He’s passed the torch on to Kjetil. “Jansrud is now the leader of that Norwegian team and I think that’s a real cool ending.” Despite the terrible race conditions, with minimal visibility and snow falling, Jansrud and Svindal managed to look a class apart from their rivals as they attacked the course in the fearless fashion the Norwegians have become known for. “I thought the top two really elevated the level of the race,” Miller said. “It was a day where it could have been a protected, easier day — no one can see anything out there and conditions are pretty tough. “I tip my hat to the top two, raise my glass, because they were in a class of their own. I haven’t seen Aksel ski with that level of intensity in quite some time, he skied like an animal today. Kjetil and Aksel did something really special today. “Aksel is a legend and will go down as that.” Svindal, who will quit with 80 World Cup podiums to his name, including 36 wins, said he had been determined to go out in spectacular fashion. “I thought it would be the right thing to do to give it a hell of a show,” he said.  “Last year, Kjetil and I did the same thing in the Olympics but I won the gold, so he deserves it today.” Jansrud, who won Super-G gold at the Sochi Olympics, is not exactly a new kid on the block at the age of 33. “Kjetil is nearly as old as I am so he will take over the dad character for sure!” Svindal, who has finally called it a day after persistent knee problems, said. “I think we have a cool team, we work hard on that too.

The operation included loading 2,000 cubic metres of LNG onto a small-scale tanker at the Singapore LNG (SLNG) Terminal, followed by an STS transfer to a receiving heavy-lift commercial vessel, Pavilion Energy said in a statement on Thursday. The use of LNG as a marine or bunker fuel has grown amid tightening regulations on global shipping emissions. “We strongly believe that LNG will become the worldwide fuel of choice for bunkering in the long term,” said Tan Soo Koong, chief executive officer of SLNG. “We are keen to work with all stakeholders and invest in infrastructure as necessary, to help grow LNG bunkering here,” Tan said. Pavilion Energy is a Singapore-based LNG company incorporated by state-owned Temasek Holdings to invest in clean energy. From 2020, International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules will ban ships from using fuels with a sulphur content above 0.5 percent - compared with 3.5 percent now - unless they are equipped to clean their sulphur emissions. Using LNG to power ships instead of traditional fuels like fuel oil or gasoil can reduce polluting emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides by 90 to 95 percent, according to industry estimates. Singapore is the world’s largest bunkering hub with sales of 49.8 million tonnes of fuel in 2018. Other major bunkering ports like Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also encouraged the use of LNG bunkers. In Rotterdam, demand for cleaner-burning LNG rose more than sixfold in 2018 to 9,500 tonnes, up from 1,500 tonnes in the year before.

Pavilion, owned by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], does not publish annual accounts and declined to reveal last year’s turnover.  It is also aiming to increase its global headcount to about 150 people by next year, by adding 40 to 50 people in various functions such as finance, risk management, LNG trading and operations in its European headquarters of Madrid which it plans to open in January 2020.      The Madrid office follows its acquisition in June of Spanish energy company Iberdrola’s LNG assets, which doubled Pavilion’s portfolio and gave it access to European regasification terminals as well as Atlantic supplies. “(We will) build the global LNG business that is also anchored around three critical markets: Singapore, Spain and the UK where we will import LNG and then sell and trade the gas in the wholesale market, in hubs and large industrial customers,” he said.    Pavilion joins other Asian companies who are increasingly looking for more flexibility to buy and trade LNG amid uncertainty in climate policies as countries grapple with the dilemma of using cheaper coal versus the more typically expensive but cleaner gas option. BEING AGILE With new supply sources emerging from the United States and the majority of LNG demand centered in Asia, cargoes will have to be shipped from far and swapped around, which “requires specific competence”, Barnaud said. “We are not looking at extremely aggressive or taking excessive risk in the market, we are looking at being agile and reasonably balanced in our supply,” he said in his first interview since taking over the helm at Pavilion last year.  In Asia, Singapore will remain the center of Pavilion’s LNG market where it plans to leverage the city state’s geographical proximity to top buyers such as Japan and South Korea, and shipping flows.  The firm is in talks with LNG terminal operator Singapore LNG Corp (SLNG) to possibly extend its storage lease when the current one expires in March 2020, after about 2-1/2 years, Barnaud said.  It has also indicated its interest for a potential fifth LNG storage tank that SLNG is considering to construct, he added. The tank space would allow Pavilion to break up large cargoes into smaller ones for re-export to neighboring countries, he said. It is also developing LNG bunkering activities, in line with Singapore’s vision of becoming a hub for the cleaner alternative to shipping fuel.  Pavilion supplies natural gas for one-third of Singapore’s industrial requirements while in Spain, it will have about 3% to 5% of market share once its acquisition is complete. “Our profile has changed, we see that others are looking at us differently already.

The bulk of the investments, totaling about S$18 million, were directed at co-funding the construction of LNG-powered vessels including tug boats, Lim said.  The remainder was directed at developing the use of LNG in the marine refueling, also known as bunkering, sector.  These included S$6 million for the construction of two barges capable of supplying ships with LNG bunkers through ship-to-ship transfers, as well as S$2 million for the development LNG-bunker trucking facilities at the Singapore LNG (SLNG) Terminal.  The investments come ahead of growing pressures on the global shipping industry to reduce its emissions footprint and as new limits on the sulfur content of marine fuels come into effect from 2020. Using LNG to power ships instead of fuel oil or marine gasoil can reduce emissions of the pollutants nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide by 90 percent to 95 percent, according to industry estimates.

prices for Japanese buyers fell in November after two straight
months of rises, the government said on Tuesday, as faltering
demand in Asia combined with rising supply from countries
including Australia and Russia.
    Asian LNG buyers face the prospect of lower import costs
over winter for the first time since the Fukushima nuclear
disaster in 2011 due to rising supplies. 
    Spot LNG contracted in November for delivery to Japan
averaged $14.40 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), down
from $15.30 a month earlier, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry (METI) said. Cargoes arriving last month averaged
$14.30 per mmBtu, compared with $12.40 in October.
    Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS were around $9.50 per mmBtu
last week, having declined from $12.90 per mmBtu a month ago,
bucking a seasonal rise in prices at this time of the year.
 
    Japan, which takes about a third of the world's LNG imports,
shipped in a record 87.73 million tonnes in the year through
March. The average spot price is based on about 10 percent of
the nation's purchases of the super-chilled fuel.
    Japan started releasing spot LNG prices in April to add
transparency to the market amid concern about rising fuel costs
in the wake of the shutdown of nuclear plants after the
Fukushima crisis.

prices for Japanese buyers fell for the third straight month in
January, Japan's trade ministry said on Tuesday, as winter
demand failed to materialise to the extent hoped.
    Spot LNG contracted in January for delivery to Japan
averaged $10.20 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), down
from $11.60 a month earlier, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry (METI) said. Cargoes arriving last month averaged
$13.90 per mmBtu, compared with $15.10 in December.
    Traders said Japanese utility Tohoku Electric in
January purchased an LNG cargo for delivery in the third week of
March at a price in the low $7 per million British thermal unit
(mmBtu) range. 
    Asian spot liquefied natural gas prices slipped to trade at
a discount to European prices for the first time since 2011, as
weak demand weighed, traders said on Friday. 
    Japan, which takes about a third of the world's LNG imports,

extended shutdown of nuclear plants, but some analysts expect
imports to fall this year as some reactors are expected to

Holdings, Inc. (Burger King) and its related entities as follows: 	
	
Burger King Capital Holdings, LLC (BKCH/Parent of Burger King Holdings, Inc.) 	
and Burger King Capital Finance, Inc. (BKCF/Financing Subsidiary) as Co-Issuers	
	
--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B-'; 	
--$672 million face value of 11% senior discount notes due 2019 at 'CC/RR6'.

--$150 million secured revolver due 2015 at 'BB-/RR1';	
--$1,532 million secured term loan due 2016 at 'BB-/RR1';	
--$248 million secured Euro tranche term loan due 2016 at 'BB-/RR1';	
--$798 million face value of 9.875% senior unsecured notes due 2018 at 	
'CCC/RR5'. 	
	
At Dec. 31, 2011, the carrying value of BKCH's and BKCF's discount notes rated 	
by Fitch was $393.4 million. At Dec. 31, 2011, the carrying value of Burger King	
Corporation's debt, including capital leases, was approximately $2.7 billion. 	
	
The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Negative.	
	
Fitch expects to assign the following rating to the successor company after the 	
closing of the recently announced merger and going public transaction:	
	
Burger King Worldwide, Inc. (Parent Holding Co.)	
	
--Long-term IDR 'B-'.	
	
Rating Rationale and Triggers:	
	
The Positive Outlook is due to improvement in Burger King's credit metrics 	
during 2011 and Fitch's view that the firm is making meaningful progress 	
executing its business strategy. In addition to achieving its general and 	
administrative (G&A) cost reduction goals, Burger King is successfully 	
refranchising lower-margin company stores, expanding outside of North America, 	
and refining its brand image. 	
	
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, rent-adjusted leverage (defined as total debt 	
inclusive of the $393.4 million aggregate carrying value of 11% discount notes 	
at BKCH and BKCF plus 8 times gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rent) 	
was 5.9 times (x). Operating EBITDAR-to-interest expense plus gross rent was 	
2.1x and FFO (funds from operations) fixed charge coverage was 2.0x. Credit 	
metrics have improved since the firm was acquired by 3G Capital Partners, Ltd. 	
(3G) in October 2010 mainly due to the previously mentioned $107 million 	
reduction in G&A expenses over the past year. Rent-adjusted leverage following 	
the buy-out was nearly 7.0x. 	
	
Fitch believes Burger King's credit statistics could experience additional 	
improvement in the near term due to better operating performance and modest debt	
reduction. According to the terms of Burger King's credit agreement the firm is 	
required to use 25% of its annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined by the agreement)	
for debt repayment. Fitch estimates this mandatory debt pay down to be about $80	
million. Rent-adjusted leverage consistently below 6.0x, as Fitch expects, along	
with meaningful free cash flow (FCF) and stable operating performance could 	
result in an upgrade to ratings. 	
	
 	
	
The pace of deleveraging could be impacted by the reduction in EBITDA caused by 	
accelerated refranchising if there is not a corresponding reduction in debt 	
and/or rent expense. However, at Dec. 31, 2011, Burger King had $459 million of 	
cash which could be used for voluntary additional debt reduction. Should debt 	
reduction exceed the mandatory prepayment requirement, leverage could decline 	
faster than currently anticipated by Fitch. 	
	
Burger King's current ratings reflect its high financial leverage and private 	
equity ownership structure, which Fitch believes adds a level of uncertainty to 	
the firm's on-going financial strategy. Partially offsetting these negatives are	
Burger King's free cash flow generation and relatively stable royalty-based 	
franchise revenue. 	
	
Merger Transaction and Public Listing:	
	
On April 3, 2012, Burger King Worldwide Holdings, Inc. announced that it will 	
become a publicly traded entity via a business combination with Justice Holdings	
Limited (Justice). Under terms of the definitive agreement, 3G will receive $1.4	
billion of cash in exchange for 29% of its ownership in Burger King. Following 	
the merger with Justice, which is expected to close in about 60 days, the 	
combined entity will be incorporated in Delaware and renamed Burger King 	
Worldwide, Inc. 	
	
Fitch views the transaction as neutral to mildly positive from a credit 	
perspective. Burger King will have access to public equity capital which could 	
help accelerate the firm's growth strategy. However, the corporation is not 	
expected to receive any cash proceeds as a result of the merger and will remain 	
closely held with 3G retaining 71%. Based on Fitch's interpretation of Burger 	
King's credit agreement and the indenture for the 2018 and 2019 notes, 	
modification of the firm's ownership structure as described above should not 	
cause a change of control triggering event or require mandatory debt repayment. 	
	
Recovery Ratings:	
	
The 'RR1' Recovery Rating on Burger King's secured debt reflects Fitch's belief 	
that recovery prospects on these obligations would remain outstanding at 	
91%-100% if the firm were to file for bankruptcy protection or restructure its 	
balance sheet. Conversely, the 'CCC/RR5' rating on Burger King's 9.875% 2018 	
notes is due to Fitch view that recovery would be below average or in the 11% - 	
30% range in a distressed situation. 	
	
The 'CC/RR6' rating on BKCH's and BKCF's 11% discount notes due 2019 implies 	
recovery prospects of 10% or less in a distressed situation because the notes 	
are structurally subordinated to Burger King's debt. Unlike the discount notes, 	
Burger King's debt is guaranteed and was issued by the operating company which 	
holds the vast majority of the firm's $5.6 billion of assets. An upgrade in the 	
IDR of Burger King or related entities or greater than expected debt reduction 	
could result in one or more upgrades to issue level and Recovery Ratings 	
assigned to all of the aforementioned obligations. 	
	
Same-Store Sales and Operational Update:	
	
Burger King's global system-wide same-store sales (SSS) performance improved 	
during 2011 but trends in North America, which represents 67% of revenue and 66%	
of operating profit excluding corporate expenses, have remained weak. 	
System-wide SSS declined 0.5% during 2011 after declining 2.4% during the 	
comparable period in 2010. SSS performance in the U.S. and Canada, however, 	
remained especially weak at negative 3.4% in 2011 and negative 4.4% in 2010. 	
	
Efforts to turn around sales in North America involve changes to Burger King's 	
menu and marketing strategy. The firm has improved the quality of its French 	
fries and has introduced menu items with broader appeal such as its Chef's 	
Choice burgers, premium salads, specialty drinks, and soft serve ice cream. 	
Burger King has also increased spending on advertising which has become more 	
food-centric and focused on core assets such as its signature flame-grilled 	
cooking process. If the firm is successful with its execution and changes in the	
menu and marketing resonate with consumers, SSS trends in North America should 	
improve.	
	
 	
	
As previously mentioned, Burger King successfully achieved its target of $85 	
million - $110 million of annual G&A cost savings during 2011. The firm's 	
operating EBITDA margin improved to 25%, up from about 20% for the comparable 	
12-month period due to lower G&A and the refranchising of 45 units. Significant 	
additional G&A cost reductions are not anticipated. However, the firm's EBITDA 	
margin is expected to increase meaningfully following its recently announced 	
agreement with Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. (Carrols; NASDAQ: TAST). Commodity	
costs are also expected to become less of a headwind for the Burger King system 	
in 2012.	
	
Transaction with Carrols:	
	
On March 26, 2012, Burger King entered into an asset purchase agreement with 	
Carrols - the firm's largest franchisee in North America with 297 units at the 	
end of 2011. The arrangement entails the refranchising of 278 company-operated 	
stores and a commitment to remodel approximately 450 units in the brand's 20/20 	
image over the next three and a half years. The transaction will be margin 	
accretive because franchised units are more profitable than company-operated 	
stores due to lower overall operating cost at the corporate level. However, the 	
decline in company restaurant revenue and EBITDA give up associated with this 	
transaction has been factored into Fitch's expectations regarding rent-adjusted 	
leverage.	
	
The total consideration to Burger King will include a 28.9% equity interest in 	
Carrols and cash of approximately $15.8 million. Concentration of franchisees is	
viewed negatively by Fitch, but Burger King's ownership interest and 	
representation on Carrols' board partially mitigates this concern. While Carrols	
is an experienced operator, Burger King will be able to exercise greater 	
influence over the management of a large block of its restaurants in the U.S. 	
	
The Carrols transaction, which is expected to close later this year, is viewed 	
as consistent with Burger King's strategy of actively refranchising 	
company-operated restaurants. Once completed, Fitch estimates that the Burger 	
King system will be more than 92% franchised, up from 90% at Dec. 31, 2011. 	
Furthermore, the agreement reflects continued progress the firm is making to 	
help broaden its appeal to a more diverse demographic of consumers via the 	
re-imaging of its restaurants.	
	
Liquidity and Maturities:	
	
As mentioned previously, Burger King had $459 million of cash at Dec. 31, 2011. 	
Excluding about $15 million of letters of credit, the firm also had $136 million	
of availability on its revolver. Burger King's liquidity is adequate and is 	
further supported by its consistent generation of meaningful FCF. Fitch believes	
Burger King has the capacity to generate over $200 million of FCF annually but 	
does not expect the firm's cash balance to remain at elevated levels. 	
	
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt are manageable with $28 million due 	
annually through 2015. Burger King's term loans amortize at a rate of 0.25% 	
quarterly with the balance payable at maturity on Oct. 19, 2016. Burger King's 	
9.875% senior unsecured notes become due Oct. 15, 2018, and BKCH's and BKCF's 	
11% discount notes mature April 15, 2019. 	
	
The discount notes are currently not guaranteed by Burger King, as mentioned 	
previously, but cash required to service the notes will be funded with 	
distributions from Burger King. This is because BKCH and BKCF have no operations	
or assets other than their interest in Burger King. The discount notes are also 	
cross-defaulted to Burger King's debt resulting in a greater incentive for the 	
operating company to service them.	
	
Financial Covenants:	
	
Burger King's credit agreement subjects the company to maximum total leverage, 	
not adjusted for leases, and minimum interest coverage financial covenants. 	
Maximum leverage was 7.50x in 2011 but declines by 0.25x annually to 6.0x in 	
2016. Minimum interest coverage was 1.70x at Dec. 31, 2011 but increases to 2.0x	
by Sept. 30, 2014. Fitch estimates that Burger King's leverage, as calculated by	
its agreement, was 4.4x at Dec. 31, 2011 providing the company with 	
approximately 40% EBITDA cushion. EBITDA headroom under the minimum interest 	
coverage test is also believed to be considerable at over 40%. 	
	
Both the 9.875% notes and the 11% discount notes contain change of control and 	
equity clawback provisions should the company engage in equity offerings prior 	
to Oct. 15, 2013. Given the voluntary nature of any equity clawback and the 	
structure of the merger with Justice, Fitch has not incorporated any debt 	
reduction associated with these notes into its expectations.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

At Dec. 31, 2012, Burger King had approximately $3 billion of total debt.

The Rating Outlook is Positive.

Rating Rationale:
The upgrade of Burger King's ratings is due to the firm's operating income
growth, declining financial leverage, and improving brand image which should
support positive future same-store sales (SSS) performance. Burger King is
successfully executing its stated business strategy which includes improving its
North American business, becoming nearly 100% franchised, and accelerating
international expansion, mainly via franchisees or master franchisee joint
ventures (JVs). Global net restaurant growth was 3.9% or a total of 485
restaurants during 2012.

Global SSS have been positive for six consecutive quarters and were 3.2% for the
2012 year, a stark improvement versus a decline of 0.5% during 2011. Burger
King's expanded line of premium burgers, smoothies, chicken strips, and salads
along with promotions such as the 55-cent anniversary WHOPPER celebration helped
drive traffic during 2012.

Income from operations increased 15.2% to $418 million while EBITDA grew 11.5%
to $652 million in 2012. Burger King's EBITDA margin of 33.2% for 2012, up from
25% in 2011, is benefiting from an accelerated pace of refranchising lower
margin company-operated restaurants, reduced general and administrative expenses
(G&A) and higher royalty income. Burger King was 97% franchised at Dec. 31, 2012
and expects to be nearly 100% franchised by the end of 2013.

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 4.7x and
total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR was approximately 5.4x. Cash flow from
operations totaled $224 million and FCF (cash flow from operations less capital
expenditures and dividends) was $140 million.

Fitch projects that rent-adjusted leverage will fall below 5.0x in 2013 due
mainly to EBITDA growth. Fitch also believes Burger King has the capacity to
generate $150 million or more of FCF annually due to lower capital expenditure
requirements once fully franchised. Fitch views this level of FCF as meaningful
for a company with Burger King's revenue base and debt structure. Total revenue
for 2012 was $2 billion and, as mentioned previously, total debt was $3 billion.

Positive Outlook:
The Positive Outlook is due to deleveraging expectations over the
near-to-intermediate term, Fitch's view that Burger King's North America
operations will continue to improve, and the fact that the company is laying a
solid foundation for faster international growth. Operating EBITDA during 2013
will be supported by controlled management general and administrative expenses
(G&A), same-store sales growth, and additional franchisee fees and royalties as
units are developed. Burger King expects to spend $200 - $220 million annually
on a go-forward basis on G&A overhead, is tweaking its barbell menu pricing
strategy to increase its competitiveness during 2013, and sees further
accelerated international net restaurant growth in 2013.

Term loan amortization, as discussed below, will result in only modest debt
reduction over the near term. Burger King currently plans to refinance its
higher coupon debt in the 2014/2015 time period. The firm's 9.875% notes due in
2018 and 11% discount notes due 2019 are subject to a make whole payment until
Oct. 15, 2014 and April 15, 2015, which makes calling these notes uneconomical
prior to late 2014.

Key Rating Drivers:
Declining Leverage and Meaningful Cash Flow Generation
Burger King's rent-adjusted leverage has declined from nearly 7.0x to
approximately 5.0x following the October 2010 leveraged buy-out by 3G Capital
Partners, Ltd. The improvement has been due to the positive impact of reduced
G&A expenses and SSS growth on operating income and cash flow. Selling, general,
and administrative expenses declined to $346 million in 2012 from $417 million
in 2011 and as mentioned previously global SSS increased 3.2% versus a decline
of 0.5% in 2011.

Additionally, a growing percentage of franchised units, which provide
high-margin royalty-based revenue, are improving Burger King's ability to
generate more stable operating cash flow. Lower capital expenditures as
franchisees fund remodeling and new unit growth along with a modest common
dividend should also support discretionary FCF. Burger King expects capital
expenditures to decline to $30 - $40 million in 2013, from $70 million in 2012,
and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.05/share resulting in an approximate
$70 million annual cash outflow for 2013.

Same-Store Sales (SSS) Growth and Net New Unit Development
SSS performance and net new unit growth are important rating drivers for Burger
King's credit ratings, as they are a key indicator of the health of the Burger
King system. As a fully franchised entity, these business statistics are
expected to provide insight on operating earnings and cash flow trends. Fitch
believes premium menu items such as the recently launched Avocado and Swiss
Whopper, a new improved coffee platform, value-oriented promotions, and limited
time offers to drive transactions will support SSS performance during 2013,
although the firm will lap strong comparisons in the first half. Moreover,
master franchise JV agreements established during 2012 should support meaningful
new unit development in markets including Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America,
and South Africa during 2013.

North American Operations
Improvement in Burger King's North America operations is a key factor in Fitch's
ratings as the region represented 63% of Burger King's $751 million of adjusted
EBITDA excluding unallocated management general and administrative expenses and
58% of the firm's 12,997 system wide restaurants in 2012. Fitch views Burger
King's progress related to its four pillar strategy - Menu, Marketing, Image,
and Operations - for North America positively as the company is experiencing
improvement in guest satisfaction and is gradually broadening its customer base
to include more women and customers over the age of 50.

Burger King's reorganized field organization and new mandatory on-line training
for operators should improve store-level operations and strengthen its
relationship with franchisees. Furthermore, recent refranchising agreements have
been structured to include required remodeling, solidifying the firm's ability
to reach its goal of having 40% of its North America system remodeled by 2015.
At Dec. 31, 2012, the Burger King system had reimaged 19% of its 7,476 units in
the U.S. and Canada, an improvement from 11% at the beginning of 2012.

Recovery Ratings:
The 'RR1' Recovery Rating on Burger King's secured debt reflects Fitch's belief
that recovery prospects on these obligations would remain outstanding at
91%-100% if the firm were to file for bankruptcy protection or restructure its
balance sheet. Collateral for this debt includes a perfected first-priority
security in interest in substantially all of Burger King's and each guarantor's
assets including intangible assets, subject to certain exceptions. Conversely,
the 'B+/RR4' rating on Burger King's 9.875% 2018 notes is due to Fitch view that
recovery would be average or in the 31% - 50% range in a distressed situation.

The 'B-/RR6' rating on BKCH's and BKCF's 11% discount notes due 2019 implies
recovery prospects of 10% or less in a distressed situation. These notes are
structurally subordinated to debt issued by Burger King Corporation because they
are not guaranteed and were not issued by the operating company which holds the
vast majority of the firm's $5.6 billion of assets at Dec. 31, 2012.

Liquidity and Maturities:
Burger King has consistently maintained good liquidity. At Dec. 31, 2012, the
firm had $547 million of cash and at Sept. 30, 2012, $118.5 million of revolver
availability net of letters of credit. Liquidity is supported by the firm's FCF,
which Fitch projects can average at least $150 million annually as mentioned
previously.

Maturities are manageable in the intermediate term and consist mainly of term
loan amortization payments through 2018. Beginning Dec. 31, 2012, Burger King's
new term loan A amortizes at a rate of $6.4 million per quarter, stepping up to
$12.9 million on Dec. 31, 2013, $19.3 million on Dec. 31, 2014, $25.8 million on
Dec. 31, 2015, and $32.2 million on Dec. 31, 2016 with the balance payable at
maturity. The new term loan B amortizes in quarterly installments equal to 0.25%
of original principal with the balance due at maturity.

Financial Covenants:
Burger King's credit agreement subjects the firm to maximum total leverage, not
adjusted for leases, and minimum interest coverage financial maintenance
covenants. Maximum leverage, excluding up to $450 million of cash, is 6.25x
beginning Dec. 31, 2012, stepping down to 6.0x March 31, 2013 through June 30,
2013, 5.75x Sept. 30, 2013 through March 31, 2014, 5.25x June 30, 2014 through
June 30, 2015, and 5.0x thereafter. Minimum interest coverage is 1.7x beginning
Dec. 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013 increasing to 2.0x after June 30, 2015. Burger
King should maintain good cushion under these covenants as current metrics are
well within these parameters.

Following the end of the fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31, 2012 and thereafter,
Burger King is required to use 50% of its annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined by
the agreement) for term loan repayment if total leverage is greater than 4.5x.
The requirement declines to 25% if total leverage is less than 4.5x but greater
than 3.5x or 0% if total leverage is less than 3.5x. Fitch anticipates that
Burger King will not be required to make an excess cash flow payment in 2013.

Rating Sensitivities
Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive
rating action include:

--Material additional deleveraging; such that total adjusted debt-to-operating
EBITDAR falls below the 4.5x range, along with continued strong FCF could result
in an upgrade in Burger King's ratings;
--Sustainably strong SSS performance, particularly in North America, would be
required for additional upgrades.

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative
rating action include:

--A downgrade in the near term is not anticipated given Burger King's improved
leverage profile, good liquidity, and lack of near-term maturities;
--However, a meaningful increase in leverage, due to increased debt or a
prolonged period of SSS declines, increased covenant risk, and negligible FCF
could result in a downgrade in ratings.

Fitch has upgraded the following ratings:

Burger King Worldwide, Inc. (Parent Holding Co.)
--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'B' from 'B-'.

Fitch has simultaneously withdrawn the following ratings:

Burger King Corporation (Operating Company)
--$150 million secured revolver due 2015 'BB-/RR1';
--$1,480.7 million secured term loan due 2016 'BB-/RR1';
--$235.1 million secured Euro tranche term loan due 2016 'BB-/RR1'.

At June 30, 2012, Burger King had $3.1 billion of total debt.

The Rating Outlook is Positive.

Rating Rationale:

The upgrade of Burger King's ratings is due to the company's declining financial
leverage, improving same-store sales (SSS) performance, and good cash flow
generation. Burger King's cash flow and margins are benefiting from general and
administrative (G&A) expense savings, significant refranchising, global SSS
growth, and international new unit development by franchisees. Cash flow from
operations (CFO), which totaled $343 million for the latest 12-month (LTM)
period ended June 30, 2012, more than satisfies Burger King's decreasing capital
expenditure requirements resulting in meaningful annual free cash flow (FCF).

Burger King's consolidated EBITDA margin has expanded to over 27% for the LTM
period ended June 30, 2012 from more than 25% at Dec. 31, 2011. At June 30,
2012, 94% of Burger King's 12,604 units were franchised, an increase from 90% at
Dec. 31, 2011. Burger King is succeeding with its goal of being a fully
franchised business. Fitch expects Burger King's EBITDA margin to experience
considerable additional expansion as a result of the financial effect of
refranchising.

The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's belief that Burger King's leverage will
continue to decline over the next 12 months from a combination of modest EBITDA
growth and moderate debt reduction. Coverage ratios should also improve as a
result of the firm's September 2012 credit facility refinancing discussed below.
Burger King is required to utilize a percentage of its excess cash flow (as
defined by the firm's credit agreement and as discussed below) for the repayment
of term loans.

Recent Same-Store Sales Improvement and Credit Metrics:

Burger King's global SSS grew 4.5% during the first six months of 2012, after
declining 2.5% for the same period last year. Comparable sales growth in North
America - which represented 67% of revenue and 66% of operating income excluding
corporate expenses during 2011 - was 4.3% during the first half of 2012 versus a
decline of 5.6% during the same period last year. Burger King has enhanced the
quality of its food and is broadening its appeal to a wider demographic with an
expanded line of premium burgers, smoothies, chicken strips, and salads. Fitch
believes good systemwide operational execution and continued remodeling of units
will enable Burger King to continue to generate positive SSS. Burger King has
reported improving guest satisfaction scores and, as of June 30, 2012,
franchisees had completed or have committed to re-image about 30% of its 7,469
units in North America.

For the LTM period ended June 30, 2012, rent-adjusted leverage (defined as total
debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rent) was 5.5x. Leverage
is down from nearly 7.0x following the October 2010 leveraged buy-out by 3G
Capital Partners, Ltd. Operating EBITDAR-to-interest expense plus gross rent was
2.1x, funds from operations (FFO) fixed-charge coverage was 2.0x, and FCF was
$262.6 million for the LTM period. Fitch believes Burger King's FCF has the
potential to approximate $200 million or more in most years, as a highly
franchised model is less capital intensive and the firm does not pay a regular
common dividend.

Refinancing of Secured Credit Facility:

On Sept. 28, 2012, Burger King entered into a new secured credit facility
consisting of a $130 million revolver expiring Oct. 19, 2015, a $1,030 million
tranche A term loan due Sept. 28, 2017, and a $705 million tranche B term loan
due Sept. 28, 2019. Proceeds were used to refinance the firm's existing secured
credit facility. As a result of the refinancing, Burger King lowered borrowing
rates and extended the maturity dates of its term loans which were due in 2016
under the old agreement. Burger King expects to achieve annual cash interest
savings of $25 million from the recent refinancing of its secured credit
facility.

Recovery Ratings:

The 'RR1' Recovery Rating on Burger King's secured debt reflects Fitch's belief
that recovery prospects on these obligations would remain outstanding at
91%-100% if the firm were to file for bankruptcy protection or restructure its
balance sheet. Conversely, the 'B/RR4' rating on Burger King's 9.875% 2018 notes
is due to Fitch's view that recovery would be average or in the 31%-50% range in
a distressed situation.

The 'CCC+/RR6' rating on Burger King Capital Holdings, LLC's and Burger King
Capital Finance, Inc.'s 11% discount notes due 2019 implies recovery prospects
of 10% or less in a distressed situation. These notes are structurally
subordinated to debt issued by Burger King Corporation because they are not
guaranteed and were not issued by the operating company which holds the vast
majority of the firm's $5.4 billion of assets at June 30, 2012.

Liquidity and Maturities:

Burger King has consistently maintained good liquidity. At June 30, 2012, the
firm had $377.7 million of cash and $138.5 million of revolver availability net
of letters of credit. Liquidity is supported by the firm's FCF, which Fitch
believes can average at least $200 million annually as mentioned previously.
Maturities are manageable in the intermediate term and consist mainly of term
loan amortization payments through 2018. Beginning Dec. 31, 2012, Burger King's
new term loan A amortizes quarterly at a rate of $6.4 million, stepping up to
$12.9 million on Dec. 31, 2013, $19.3 million on Dec. 31, 2014, $25.8 million on
Dec. 31, 2015, and $32.2 million on Dec. 31, 2016 with the balance payable at
maturity. The new term loan B amortizes in quarterly installments equal to 0.25%
of original principal with the balance due at maturity.

Financial Covenants:

Burger King's new credit agreement subjects the firm to maximum total leverage,
not adjusted for leases, and minimum interest coverage financial maintenance
covenants. Maximum leverage is 6.25x beginning Dec. 31, 2012, stepping down to
6.0x March 31, 2013 through June 30, 2013, 5.75x Sept. 30, 2013 through March
31, 2014, 5.25x June 30, 2014 through June 30, 2015, and 5.0x thereafter.
Minimum interest coverage is 1.7x beginning Dec. 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013,
increasing to 2.0x after June 30, 2015. Burger King should maintain ample
cushion under these covenants as current metrics are well within these
parameters.

Following the end of the fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31, 2012 and thereafter,
Burger King is required to use 50% of its annual excess cash flow (as defined by
the agreement) for term loan repayment if total leverage is greater than 4.5x.
The requirement declines to 25% if total leverage is less than 4.5x but greater
than 3.5x, or 0% if total leverage is less than 3.5x. Fitch estimates that total
leverage, which as defined by the company's new credit facility is based on
total debt of the borrower and restricted subsidiaries less up to $450 million
of cash, was about 3.6x at June 30, 2012.

What Could Trigger A Rating Action

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive
rating action include:

--Material additional deleveraging; such that total adjusted debt-to-operating
EBITDAR approximates 5.0x or lower, along with continued good FCF could result
in an upgrade of Burger King's ratings;
--Sustainably strong SSS performance, particularly in North America, and stable
to improving EBITDA margins would be required for additional upgrades.

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative
rating action include:

--A downgrade in the near term is not anticipated given Burger King's improved
leverage profile, good liquidity, and lack of near-term maturities;
--However, a meaningful increase in leverage, due to increased debt or a
prolonged period of SSS declines, increased covenant risk, and negligible FCF,
could result in a downgrade.

Bruce Hicks, a company spokesman, said on Friday that AMR Corp would discontinue retiree life insurance and would end medical coverage for those over 65. That group would, instead, have access to a Medicare supplement at their own cost. Retirees under 65 would still have access to company plans, but at their own expense as well, Hicks said. AMR asked a New York bankruptcy judge to declare that it has the right to alter company-funded retiree benefits because they were never vested. American’s retiree health plans cover more than 40,000 people. In the filing, American argued that it would be required to maintain company-provided benefits only if it had promised to provide those benefits for life. AMR made no such promises, and explicitly reserved its right to modify its retiree benefit plans, it said. “The restructuring process is difficult for everyone affected, and we understand any changes to these benefits are concerning to our retirees,” Hicks said. A lawyer for a committee of retired workers did not respond to requests for comment. Other U.S. airlines reduced retiree health plans while in bankruptcy and eliminated or changed pension plans as well to save money. American sought bankruptcy protection in November, citing high labor costs. AMR has said it must save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in labor costs, and has sought to achieve those savings through concessions from workers, including unionized pilots, flight attendants and ground workers. Unions, livid over those demands, are supporting an effort by US Airways to merge with AMR, a prospect the unions say could salvage some jobs and benefits. AMR said it had $1.25 billion in retiree health and welfare liability as of 2010. The proposed cuts to retiree benefits are very similar to previously proposed changes that would affect current workers who retire in the future.

A worker walks underneath an American Airlines airplane at Miami International airport in Miami, Florida November 29, 2011.   REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe proposal, which would avert the largest pension default in U.S. history, could move the third-largest U.S. airline a step closer to consensual deals with its major unionized work groups as its struggles to slash uncompetitive labor costs. AMR, which filed for Chapter 11 on November 29, had been the only major airline to avoid bankruptcy in the last decade and is the only one that still has traditional, or defined benefit, pensions, the company said. “Freezing the defined benefit pension plans would mean that employees would retain the full value of benefits accrued for service prior to the date the plan is frozen,” said Jeff Brundage, AMR’s senior vice president of human Resources, in a letter to employees. “Freezing instead of terminating these plans of course would mean we will have significantly larger pension costs than contemplated in our business plan,” Brundage said. AMR has said it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion, including $1.25 billion in labor costs. AMR said it still must achieve the labor savings target and it would seek new capital to cover the incremental annual costs of funding frozen pensions. AMR said in letters to employees that the pension proposal does not extend to its pilots because their plan includes provisions for a costly lump sum payout to retiring workers that other work groups do not have. “Given the number of pilots who are eligible to retire, the company would be at significant operational risk if we emerge from Chapter 11 with a frozen plan that allows pilots to retire with a lump sum benefit,” Brundage said. AMR still wants to terminate the pilots’ plan unless it can get the lump sum matter resolved. The Allied Pilots Association said in a letter to members that it would ask them to waive the lump sum option in the plans that feature it so that those pensions can be frozen as well. “Our plan is the only one on the AMR property that includes the option of a lump sum and our experts have concluded that attempting to preserve a lump-sum option is not achievable,” APA President David Bates said. VICTORY FOR PENSION INSURER AMR said in February that it would seek bankruptcy court approval to terminate traditional pension plans covering 130,000 workers and retirees. Those plans would be replaced with 401(k) plans with a company match. Employer-financed defined benefit plans provide a fixed payout over time and are historically more generous than the 401(k) or other cash plans that mix employee and employer contributions that are more common today. Traditional pensions are often still found in heavily unionized industries such as airlines, autos and aerospace. AMR’s pensions covering pilots, flight attendants and ground workers were underfunded by an estimated $10 billion when the company filed for bankruptcy. Underfunding is the difference between the assets in a plan and the amount of future obligations. United Airlines had the largest pension default in the United States at nearly $9 billion underfunded. The decision is a victory for U.S. pension insurers, who waged a public campaign against plans by American to cancel its pensions in bankruptcy. “Bankruptcy forces tough choices, but that doesn’t mean pensions must be sacrificed for companies to succeed. We will continue to work with American and the other participants in the bankruptcy to ensure that success,” Josh Gotbaum, director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, said in a statement. The agency reported a record deficit of $26 billion in 2011 and is responsible for payouts to 1.5 million people. It paid more than $5 billion in benefits last year. In many cases, retirees get less in benefits when the government takes over the pensions of bankrupt companies. The Transport Workers Union, which represents many of the ground workers at AMR, cheered the plan, saying an earlier proposal to terminate pensions was “totally unacceptable.” “I have to say that I do consider it a win because terminating is not an option,” TWU President James Little told Reuters. “I think that would have been the most devastating.” He said that while TWU would rather keep its pension plans intact, a freeze is more palatable and advances the union’s goal of reaching a deal with AMR. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants said on its website that it has not responded to AMR’s proposal and that it was “meeting internally to evaluate the proposal.” American has almost 74,000 full- and part-time employees and its regional carrier American Eagle has about 14,000 full- and part-time employees. The company has been leaning on its labor unions to agree to concessions. Should AMR and its unions be unable to reach consensual deals, AMR could ask the bankruptcy judge to abrogate existing labor deals and allow the company to impose new terms.

A US Airways plane and an American Airlines plane share a terminal at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington April 23, 2012. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueAmerican’s parent company, AMR Corp AAMRQ.PK, worked out the $11 billion merger with US Airways as part of a plan to exit bankruptcy, where it has been since 2011. Judge Sean Lane had been expected to approve the plan at a hearing on Thursday. But, two days before the hearing, the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher fares and hurt consumers. Instead of approving the plan, Lane gave AMR and its creditors until August 23 to submit briefs on how he should proceed. Lane said he needed more information about the appropriateness of approving the restructuring plan in light of the antitrust challenge. AMR and US Airways, which have said they will fight the antitrust lawsuit, and their lawyers argued on Thursday that Lane should still approve the bankruptcy plan. A lawyer for US Airways, Daniel Wall, said the Justice Department’s timing, just two days before the final hearing, was “audacious.” “Don’t allow the bankruptcy issues, which are complicated enough on their own, to be held hostage to very late-filed antitrust issues,” Wall told the judge. But Lane cited “lingering doubts” about the benefits of approving a bankruptcy plan before the antitrust issue is resolved. “What would be the point of entering a confirmation order ... if, in fact, there’s a lot more work to be done?” he said. Under the restructuring plan, a reorganization cannot go ahead without antitrust approval for the merger, which could take months. If the Justice Department ultimately succeeds in blocking the merger, it would put AMR’s restructuring back at square one, requiring it to forge new strategies for paying back creditors. AMR shareholders, who stand to receive a 3.5 percent stake in the new entity under the merger, would likely be wiped out under any plan that excludes a merger, restructuring experts have said. Lane said he had strongly considered canceling Thursday’s hearing but decided to give parties an open forum to discuss the antitrust challenge. The bankruptcy plan has the support of nearly all of AMR’s key creditors, and Lane had already signed off on the merger and an initial outline of the restructuring plan that incorporates it. Absent the antitrust challenge, Thursday’s hearing would have been the final step in AMR’s exiting bankruptcy and implementing its merger.

In a strongly worded labor negotiations update, the third-largest U.S. airline said it must make major changes to its contracts and that it does have the “luxury of time.” “As the company laid out in its February 1 restructuring announcement, we must make major changes to our labor agreements. And we need those changes in a matter of weeks,” the carrier said. AMR filed for Chapter 11 protection on Nov. 29, citing uncompetitive labor costs after years of fruitless talks with its unions. The carrier says it must cut 13,000 jobs as part of a plan to trim costs by $2 billion. The carrier dismissed requests for buyouts from unions representing its flight attendants and many ground workers, saying the proposals “represent a significant cost to the company and could not be accepted on their terms.” Unlike its top rivals United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, AMR did not restructure in bankruptcy in the last 10 years.

The move came after AMR agreed to preserve potential clawback claims relating to debt deals, struck between Marathon and AMR, that left American Airlines with $2.26 billion of debt. AMR entered bankruptcy last November, and is considering its options for emerging either as a standalone firm or to merge with smaller competitor US Airways Group, which is making an aggressive takeover push. Marathon, which has said it holds “well over” $100 million of AMR debt, last month sought an examiner to probe intercompany transactions consummated in the weeks before AMR’s Chapter 11 filing. The deals transferred about $2.26 billion of debt from AMR’s American Eagle unit to American Airlines. Marathon said in court papers it was concerned that potential legal claims to claw the money back would be barred under the language of a separate settlement, under which AMR refinanced about 200 of its aircraft. AMR dismissed that argument in court filings as an “obvious litigation tactic.” But on Thursday, it agreed to expressly preserve such claims in exchange for Marathon dropping its request for an examiner, AMR attorney Richard Hahn said at the hearing in federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y.. The resolution also allows AMR to move forward with the underlying aircraft refinancing deal, which it says will save about $670 million on planes manufactured by Embraer. Marathon has been taking a more vocal role in AMR’s bankruptcy, adding another layer of complexity to the already multi-faceted case. The examiner request was Marathon’s second attempt to flex its muscles as a significant creditor, coming days after it sent a letter to AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton demanding more transparency about the airline’s restructuring efforts. It remains unclear whether Marathon supports a standalone restructuring or a US Airways merger, or whether Marathon would be in a position to finance an independent exit from bankruptcy for AMR. But as a large debtholder, the hedge fund could be in a position to influence either scenario by objecting to plans it does not support. US Airways would like to acquire AMR out of bankruptcy, while a group of debtholders including JPMorgan Chase & Co  has expressed interest in financing a standalone exit. AMR received court permission at Thursday’s hearing to extend for 30 days, through Jan. 28, its unilateral control of its bankruptcy exit plan. That means US Airways cannot propose its own takeover plan until that date, and that any merger plan before that date would have to be a cooperative effort with AMR. Labor issues will also affect AMR’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy independently. High labor costs were a driving force in the company’s bankruptcy filing, and while the airline has reached new collective bargaining deals with its flight attendants’ and ground workers’ unions, it remains at odds with its pilots. That could spook investors assessing the company’s stability going forward, and AMR’s creditors’ committee has said labor peace with pilots is a top priority. While AMR and its pilots continue to negotiate, the pilots have said they support a merger with US Airways. They have also said they already have a tentative labor deal in place with US Airways.

TWU has asked American’s parent company AMR Corp  for details on how it arrived at the cost-savings targets it unveiled this month when it said it planned to eliminate 13,000 jobs and terminate pensions. Union president James Little told Reuters in an interview the union hopes to draw on the labor deals it struck with the company prior to the Nov. 29 bankruptcy filing to salvage some of those jobs. “It’s irresponsible for us to take those numbers for granted and not do our own analysis,” Little said. AMR said it was aiming for $2 billion in total annual cost reductions, including $1.25 billion in employee-related expenses. American, the third-largest U.S. airline, said it may eliminate 13,000 jobs as part of its restructuring. About 9,000 of those workers are members of the TWU, which had already negotiated contracts or tentative labor deals for four of the seven work groups it represents at AMR when the company filed for Chapter 11. Little said the TWU is waiting for financial information from the company so it can either challenge the cost-savings targets or suggest alternatives to help AMR reach its targets in a way that makes the cuts more palatable to its members. “We would like to reach a consensual agreement,” Little said, adding that he expected other labor unions also to offer alternatives to the AMR’s plan. The airline has presented non-public details of its restructuring plan to members of its creditors committee. Labor unions representing pilots, flight attendants and groundworkers, have three of the nine seats AMR presented to creditors. Any reorganization plan would require approval from AMR’s bankruptcy court judge. AMR restructured out of court nearly 10 years ago, while several of its rivals like United Airlines and Delta Air Lines slashed costs with Chapter 11 protection. Those two airlines emerged from Chapter 11 stronger, went on to find merger partners and now earn profits while AMR posts losses. AMR, meanwhile, relied on voluntary concessions during its last reorganization but now complains its labor costs are higher than its competitors. American said it lost $10 billion over the past decade and financed the red ink with debt. The period was marked mainly by industry downturns triggered by the 2001 hijack attacks, recession, and skyrocketing fuel prices. American has about 73,800 full and part-time employees and its regional carrier American Eagle has 14,200 full- and part-time employees.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

An American Airlines plane sits at its gate while another taxis for departure at O'Hare International airport in Chicago November 29, 2011. AMR Corp, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, said on Tuesday it eliminated five senior jobs as part of its restructuring and that its lead labor strategist would step down. REUTERS/Frank PolichThe cuts, combined with the previously announced departure of other managers, represents a “20 percent reduction in the company’s most senior leadership positions,” AMR said in a statement. An AMR spokeswoman said eight or nine management jobs had been cut so far. AMR filed for bankruptcy in November, citing a need to slash uncompetitive costs. The company has said it intends to cut its overall costs by $2 billion a year. More than half of that amount will come from labor costs. “Redesigning the organization will help accelerate our progress toward profitability and success,” said AMR Chief Executive Tom Horton in a letter to employees. “Every step increases our clarity of purpose and helps speed decisions in the interest of best serving our customers.” Among the five departing executives are David Brooks, American’s President - Cargo, and Susan Garcia, American’s Vice President - Information Technology. In the same statement, AMR said Jeff Brundage, who is AMR’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources, has been replaced in his role by Denise Lynn, who will carry the job title Senior Vice President - People. The company did not say why Brundage was replaced. He will not immediately leave the company. “For now, I’m not going anywhere and will continue to work with many of you on the needed changes,” he said. Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former AMR executive, said Brundage’s departure is ironic amid the ongoing labor clash between AMR and its management. As AMR overhauls its management team, the airline is battling its unions in court over its request to void their labor contracts if workers do not willingly make the concessions the company says it needs to survive. American has been locked for years in fruitless negotiations with its three labor unions, which represent pilots, flight attendants and several classifications of ground workers. The airline won steep concessions from labor in 2003 as it dodged bankruptcy at the time. The carrier has about 74,000 full- and part-time workers. The company has said it must cut 13,000 union jobs. Against this backdrop, rival airline US Airways Group is hoping to jumpstart merger talks with AMR, which so far has shrugged off the interest. To further that goal, US Airways last month struck deals with AMR’s unions, which say US Airway’s plan save more jobs than AMR could through its stand-alone plan. The unions each have seats on AMR’s creditors committee, meaning they have a say in how AMR exits bankruptcy. For now, however, the carrier has the exclusive right under bankruptcy law to reorganize without interference from outsiders. The airline says it still hopes to reach consensual deals with its workers. AMR has presented what it calls its last and best offer to the Transport Workers Union, which represents 26,000 workers in seven work groups American Airlines. A TWU spokesman on Tuesday said information on AMR’s offer will be sent by mail to members this week with voting set to begin next week. American Airlines is the third-largest U.S. airline. It had been the only major U.S. airline to avoid Chapter 11 in the last decade, a factor that gave rivals a cost advantage.

Organizers Extinction Rebellion have called for non-violent civil disobedience to force the British government to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025 and stop what they call a global climate crisis. The protests did not cause major travel disruption on Friday during one of Britain’s biggest holiday weekends, but police said they have now arrested more than 682 people. Extinction Rebellion blocked several locations in central London this week after staging a semi-nude protest in parliament earlier this month. “Our planet is in serious trouble,” Thompson told reporters amid a crowd of about 300 activists, according to eye witnesses. She addressed them from a pink boat in the middle of London’s Oxford Circus as shoppers and tourists milled past. “We are here in this island of sanity and it makes me so happy to be able to join you all and to add my voice to the young people here who have inspired a whole new movement,” said Thompson, one of Britain’s most acclaimed actresses who has won two Academy awards.

Watson, Murad and women’s rights leaders from more than 20 countries have identified nearly 80 “good practices” in gender equality law pertaining to violence, economic empowerment, education, health and discrimination. The nearly 40-strong Gender Equality Advisory Council will  press their case to the Group of Seven member countries, which include Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Italy and Canada, at their annual meeting. “The Council expresses great concern about the persistent, and even growing, threats and backlash against girls’ and women’s rights in many countries,” it said in recommendations published this week ahead of the summit. The council, formed in 2018 under then-G7 leader Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and renewed by French president Emanuel Macron, also condemned “the considerable responsibility of some political leaders in this step backwards.” Watson, a fellow advisory member who has been a vocal advocate for women’s rights as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador and active member of Time’s Up, has used her star power to galvanize public discussion on gender equality. “The G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council has a simple first step for #genderequality: Ditch discriminatory laws and adopt laws that lift up girls and women,” the “Harry Potter” star  wrote on Instagram to more than 51 million followers. The council’s recommendations call on G7 countries to make political and economic advances for women within their own countries but also a centerpiece of foreign policy, encouraging other countries to follow suit. The G7 countries comprise more than 10% of the world’s population and over 40% of its wealth. “We have the evidence that a gender equal world is healthier, wealthier, more productive and more peaceful,” Katja Iversen, the president and CEO of Women Deliver told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Thursday. “We call on them not just to do it right in their own countries, but to use their political and financial power to push the rest of the world.”  Iverson pointed to past successes such as Rwanda’s 2003 decision to implement a 30% quota on female elected officials as a progressive move with lasting effect. Today the government is over 60% female. The council’s recommendations also call on countries to address physically and economically harmful practices like child marriage, inheritance laws that prevent men leaving wealth to their wives and weak domestic violence laws. Its call to action implored leaders not only to usher in new laws, but to see them enforced, measure their progress and be transparent about the results. Macron’s official recommendation to G7 leadership will be for each country to adopt at least one new progressive law by next year, a bar Iversen hopes to see exceeded. “We’re seeing progress, but also pushback, and we need to push back against the pushback,” she said.

Reproductive rights experts say outlawing abortion forces women to resort to unsafe terminations, which cause almost 23,000 deaths every year. But abortion opponents say the fetus’s right to life transcends all other rights.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri NEW YORK (Reuters) - Actress Emma Stone will replace Michelle Williams and make her Broadway debut as singer Sally Bowles opposite Tony winner Alan Cumming in the musical “Cabaret,” producers said on Wednesday. The 25-year-old actress, who starred in Woody Allen’s “Magic in the Moonlight” and superhero action franchise “The Amazing Spider-Man,” will begin on Nov. 11 in the musical set during the rise of Nazism in Berlin. “Cabaret” is based on Christopher Isherwood’s 1939 novel “Goodbye to Berlin,” which chronicles in part the seedy cabaret nightlife of the German capital in the final years of the Weimar Republic. Williams has extended her run in the role made famous by Liza Minnelli to Nov. 9, and Cumming will continue to play the emcee at the Kit Kat Klub until March 29. The revival of the 1998 Tony Award-winning production that opened on April 24 at Studio 54 has won rave reviews, with the Hollywood Reporter describing it as a “thrilling production, which is even sharper this time around.”  Reporting by Patricia Reaney; Editing by Eric Kelsey and Leslie AdlerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Today’s example is provided by the Washington Post Co and its flagship paper (and the online site Slate). The company reported third quarter earnings including results from its newspaper division today. Print advertising revenue fell 20 percent to $57.6 million — quite a stunning plunge even  as newspapers across the U.S. manage to post quarter after quarter of print ad revenue declines. Even more disturbing is that online revenue, which includes washingtonpost.com and Slate, plunged 14 percent to $23.3 million. Display online ad revenue dropped 17 percent. The Washington Post is one of those curious oddities in the industry that manages to be extremely local — it’s market penetration of the D.C. area has always been one of the highest in the U.S. — and also draws the interest of a large national audience. So while it may compete with the “nationals” i.e. New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, on the news front,  it is very dependent on local advertising. The NYT, USAT and WSJ get a hefty portion of their advertising revenue through national advertisers. The local advertising category hasn’t been holding up as well as national advertising. It’s taking it on the chin as the housing market struggles, unemployment remains high and retail outlets are going out of business or simply taking their advertising elsewhere. That’s not to say that national advertising revenue isn’t hurting as well.  It’s more of a mixed bag. At the New York Times, for example, the division that mainly includes its flagship paper reported advertising revenue fell 6 percent to $156.1 million in Q3. Gannett, which publishes USAT, used to give some information on how that paper was doing by reporting paid ad pages, but the company ceased — to use the parlance of research analysts — to provide more color on the USAT front. Instead, Gannett reports that national advertising,  including USAT, fell 17 percent. USAT represents a big chunk of Gannett’s national advertising. The Wall Street Journal manages somehow to defy these trends. Ad revenue rose 13 percent in the third quarter– that includes print and online –  according to a memo from Dow Jones’ top executive Todd Larsen to employees.   Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Taekwondo athlete Mandy Meloon (L) poses with her grandfather Heinz Dieter Mrugalla and mother Martina Flores shortly after winning the bronze medal in the 2005 World Championships, in Zweibrueken, Germany and provided April 10, 2018.   Courtesy of Mandy Meloon/Handout via REUTERSWhen she first complained about being sexually abused by Jean Lopez, then the team’s head coach, USA Taekwondo officials said the claims were false slurs that damaged morale, and Meloon was soon suspended from the team. Lopez and his siblings were the sport’s most prominent family, bringing home Olympic gold medals. Lopez did not respond to Reuters’ emails and requests for comment left with staff at his taekwondo studio in Las Vegas, nor did his lawyer respond. Previously Lopez has denied inappropriate sexual contact with Meloon, now 37, and two other athletes who have accused him. After Meloon’s suspension, she struggled for years with money and mental health issues. In 2016, she began serving a two-year prison sentence after assaulting an off-duty Texas sheriff’s deputy who was trying to remove her from a bar after an employee asked her to leave. But in April, a report from a new investigatory body found “a preponderance of the evidence” showing Meloon, along with fellow athletes Heidi Gilbert and Kay Poe, had told the truth in their years-old accusations against Lopez. Lopez was permanently banned from the sport, a decision he is appealing. “I think all of us owe them big thank you’s,” Brandon Meek, a former director on USA Taekwondo’s board, said of Meloon and two other women who accused Lopez.  Gilbert told Reuters that reading the report made her feel “numb.” Poe, through her lawyer, declined to be interviewed by Reuters.   Meloon was once dismissed as a troublemaker, having spoken up long before the recent wave of reckonings for powerful men in media, politics and sport accused of sexual abuse and the ensuing #MeToo movement empowering victims to come forward. Now she is seen by some in the sport as a trailblazer and a case study in the potential consequences of ignoring those who come forward with complaints of abuse.  “I know she’s had a rough time,” said Steve McNally, who became USA Taekwondo’s director last year. “I hope she can put this behind her, and if I can help with this at all I’d be glad to.” He said he could not comment on Lopez while his appeal was under way.  PARALLEL TO GYMNASTICS CASE Meloon’s experience is similar in some ways to the abuse of young female gymnasts by Larry Nassar, the doctor for the U.S. national gymnastics team who is spending the rest of his life in prison after scores of his victims testified in nationally televised court hearings earlier this year.  Meloon said the abuse began at age 13, when Lopez frequently engaged her in uncomfortable discussions about sex as soon she started training with him at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado. In 1997, when she was 16, Lopez, then in his early 20s, drunkenly crawled into bed with her and engaged in inappropriate contact during a trip to Cairo, she said. She won a World Cup silver medal on that trip. A few months after she filed a written complaint in 2006, USA Taekwondo officials suspended Meloon ahead of the Olympic Games in Beijing, saying Meloon had “wrongfully accused” coaches of soliciting her for sex. “These defamatory utterances are untrue and damaging to the morale of the national team and USAT staff and coaches,” their report said. They also said Meloon smoking and drinking alcohol excessively and was refusing to train. Her athletic career abruptly over, Meloon says she struggled alone, sometimes homeless or in psychiatric wards, sometimes working in construction or restaurants, having forsaken even a high-school diploma during her rise as a teenage athlete. Toward the end of her prison sentence, Meloon saw the first sign of shifting public sentiment on sexual assault. An investigator from the U.S. Center for SafeSport, set up last year to investigate sexual misconduct in Olympic sports, met her in August to review her complaint.  When she was released in January, she started hearing from former teammates and coaches about #MeToo. “I come out of prison and people are calling me and are like, ‘We believe you, we support you! Yay! #MeToo!’” Meloon, who now lives in Austin, Texas, said in a telephone interview. “I’m like: Where were y’all 11 years ago?”  FILE PHOTO: Jean Lopez, brother and coach to U.S. taekwondo exponent Steven Lopez, celebrates after his brother won a gold medal at World Taekwondo Championships in Madrid, Spain April 15, 2005.

A day after reading the report, Meloon said she was still processing it. Despite her worries that Lopez could yet get the ban overturned, she acknowledged: “It’s more than I could ever hope for.”  Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Frank McGurty and Cynthia OstermanOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
