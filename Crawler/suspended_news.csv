CORONA, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 14, 2019 / ADOMANI, Inc. (“ADOMANI”) (NASDAQ:ADOM), a provider of advanced zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicle drivetrain solutions and purpose-built electric vehicles, was notified today by the staff (the “Staff”) of the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) that NASDAQ has initiated proceedings to delist ADOMANI’s common stock from trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market due to ADOMANI’s failure to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing pursuant to Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) of The NASDAQ Stock Market within the applicable compliance period.

ADOMANI has discussed with the Staff the procedures for appealing the Staff’s determination to the NASDAQ Hearings Panel in accordance with the applicable Listing Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market and, based on such discussions and the fact that ADOMANI has unsuccessfully solicited the requisite approval of its stockholders to effect a reverse stock split at each of the last two annual meetings of its stockholders, it is ADOMANI assessment that it is unlikely ADOMANI would be successful in such proceedings and, as such, ADOMANI does not intend to appeal the Staff’s determination. Accordingly, it is expected that the trading of ADOMANI’s common stock will be suspended by NASDAQ at the opening of business on August 22, 2019, and that NASDAQ will file a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission on such date to effect the removal of ADOMANI’s securities from listing and registration on NASDAQ.

ADOMANI has submitted an application for listing on the OTCQX® Best Market and, pending the completion of the application process and its acceptance by the OTC Markets Group, ADOMANI intends for its common stock to be listed for trading on the OTCQX under its current trading symbol “ADOM”. Following the completion of the delisting from NASDAQ, ADOMANI will remain a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and continue to be subject to the public reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ADOMANI does not expect that the contemplated delisting or subsequent transition to the OTC Markets will affect its business or operations.

BKCH,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/23/more-marijuana-etfs-are-right-around-the-corner.aspx,"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT","Sat, 23 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",2019-10-03-19-33,More Marijuana ETFs Are Right Around the Corner - The Motley Fool,"Legal marijuana has sparked an investing revolution, and companies have sprung up quickly to capitalize on the cannabis craze. With legalized recreational marijuana throughout Canada and in many U.S. states, there's plenty of opportunity for cannabis cultivators to sell their goods, and investors are finding that more companies are looking to go public and make their shares available to meet demand.

Despite the popularity of marijuana stocks, there's been a surprisingly limited number of options for investors who prefer the diversification that exchange-traded funds provide. Most of the business early on has gone to the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEMKT:MJ), which recently topped the $1 billion mark in assets under management. Given the huge returns for shares of cannabis companies so far in 2019, there's huge pressure for that to change -- and fund companies are looking to overcome one big obstacle that's presented a challenge for would-be entrants to the pure-play marijuana ETF space.

Who's looking to join the marijuana ETF universe

Several fund companies have sought to create ETFs that track the cannabis industry. Last November, Innovation Shares filed to offer its Innovation Shares Cannabis ETF, which would focus on an index of Canadian and U.S. companies that are involved in either legal marijuana or similar products like hemp or cannabis-derived oils. Minimum market capitalization for marijuana stocks in the ETF would be $100 million, and weightings would be by market cap but with a maximum allocation of 7%.

Then, in late January, AdvisorShares joined the fray with a filing of its own. The ETF management company proposed the AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF. The investment objective for the AdvisorShares fund would be similar to those of other pure-play cannabis ETFs, with at least 80% of assets invested in companies that get at least half of their sales from marijuana or hemp or that are registered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency for handling marijuana, cannabis, or related products for research and development purposes. The fund would have active management in selecting cannabis stocks.

Finally, earlier this month, Amplify ETFs filed for its Amplify Seymour Alternative Plant Economy ETF. The fund seeks to be actively managed, with companies falling into one of three categories. The first includes cannabis and hemp plant specialists, including both cultivation and growth companies and pharmaceutical and biotech businesses. The ETF would also include support companies in areas like agricultural technology, real estate, and commercial services. Finally, ancillary companies could be included if they worked in areas like producing consumption devices and mechanisms, providing investing and financial services to the industry, or other related businesses.

The big hang-up for marijuana ETFs

Given how popular Alternative Harvest has been, it might seem like a no-brainer for competing marijuana ETFs to emerge. But the big problem that would-be ETF providers have faced is finding a financial institution that would be willing to act as custodian for the cannabis investments the funds want to buy. Federal banking laws create risk for financial institutions that hold custody of stocks that are involved with illegal drug activities, and because marijuana is still illegal under U.S. federal law, risk managers among potential custodial firms have been reluctant to get involved in the business.

Recently, there've been some political moves that have reduced those risks. The Justice Department has seen a change of leadership, and the new nominee to head the department has been more willing to recognize state law governing marijuana than the former U.S. attorney general.

Even so, the issue remains controversial. Alternative Harvest had a similar problem, initially having U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) act as custodian, administrator, and transfer agent. But last September, the fund changed its custodian to L.A.'s Wedbush Securities, passing off other responsibilities to specialist institutions. It's likely that future marijuana ETFs will follow a similar path, seeking to use institutions that aren't traditional banks but that can still act as custodians under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

Check out the latest earnings call transcripts for companies we cover.

Look out for new marijuana ETFs

Whenever there's a successful new investing trend, fund companies seek to take advantage of it, and that's what's driving the push toward new marijuana ETFs. Challenges still exist, but it's likely that these and other new proposed funds in the cannabis space will make it through the SEC approval process. At that point, it'll be important to look at the differences among the marijuana ETFs and decide which offers the best way to invest in cannabis over the long run."

(CTST) said late Thursday it's suspending sales and shipments of all of its cannabis products and appointing a committee of independent directors to investigate problems at the Canadian supplier of medical and recreational cannabis.

The sales and shipment suspension will continue ""while Health Canada visits and reviews its Vaughan, Ontario manufacturing facility,"" the company said in a statement.

Earlier this week Canadian authorities found the company's greenhouse facility in Pelham, Ontario to be ""non-compliant"" with Canadian health regulations and placed a hold on 5,200 kilograms of dried cannabis that was harvested from five unlicensed rooms at the location.

The company said ""the impact of these matters on CannTrust's financial results are unknown until the regulatory review process is complete.""

U.S. listed shares of CannTrust fell 30 cents, or 9.6%, to $2.81 in after-hours trading. For the week, shares are down 45%.

Jim Cramer told his Mad Money audience on Thursday night that he's had to reevaluate cannabis stocks.

Last year, the stocks caught fire after Canada legalized recreational use.

But now the leader in the industry, Canopy Growth CGC (CGC) has seen pricing decline and production slow as costs began to skyrocket. These changes led to CEO Bruce Linton's firing at the hands of its biggest investor, Constellation Brands (STZ) .

Cramer said he still sees Canopy as the leader in the sector. He also still recommended Cronos Group (CRON) , which received an investment from Altria (MO) , as well as GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) . Cramer suggested investors avoid the rest of the cannabis stocks and even cannabis ETFs, as they lump bad names with the good ones into one security.

In action during the regular session Thursday, the Alternative Harvest ETF ( MJ ) fell 24 cents, or 0.78%, to $30.66. The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF ( YOLO ) fell 33.99 cents, or 1.52%, to $21.95. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF ( HMLSF ) fell 28.14 cents, or 2.08%, to $13.27."

It all started with the Trump administration lifting tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on May 10 and China announcing a retaliatory move — a tariff hike on $60 billion worth of American goods to 25%, starting Jun 1. President Donald Trump is also considering additional tariffs on an incremental $325 billion of Chinese imports (read: Full-Blown Trade Spat: 5 Most-Vulnerable Sector ETFs & Stocks).

Additionally, Trump has banned Chinese firm Huawei Technologies and 26 of its affiliates from doing business with American companies effective May 17, though it provided a 90-day exemption. To hit back, China is considering restricting rare-earth exports to the United States, per media reports (read: Intensifying Trade Woes Trigger Rally in Treasury ETFs).

Understandably, the markets are volatile. The 10-year U.S. treasury yield is trading below that of the one-month, two-month, three-month, six-month and one-year for the last four days (as of May 29, 2019) (read: Recession Fear Lurking: ETFs & Stocks to Play).

The S&P 500 (down 5.5%), the Dow Jones (down 4.7%) and the Nasdaq (down 6%) were in red in the past month (as of May 29, 2019). Stocks slumped to a three-month low at the end of the month.

Against this backdrop, let’s take a look at some of the best-and-worst-performing ETF areas in the month of May (read: May ETF Asset Report: Quality U.S. Equities Win).

Top ETFs

iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN VXX — Up 16.2%

The S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index Total Return offers exposure to a daily rolling long position in the first and second month VIX futures contracts and reflects views of the future direction of the VIX index at the time of expiration of the VIX futures contracts comprising the Index. The note charges 89 bps in fees.

AdvisorShares Dorsey Wright Short ETF DWSH — Up 12.8%

The AdvisorShares Dorsey Wright Short ETF is actively-managed with an investment focus that involves buying securities that have appreciated more than other securities and holding those securities until they underperform. The fund charges 99 bps in fees.

Teucrium Corn Fund CORN — Up 10.0%

The underlying Corn Futures index looks to reflect the daily changes of a weighted average of the closing prices for three futures contracts for corn that are traded on the CBOT.

Corn prices soared to a three-year high on inclement weather conditions. There are reports that US producers are suspending corn planting following a record wet spell across the country, while forecasts for more rains linger (read: 4 Agricultural Commodity ETFs Surging Double Digits in May).

Flop ETFs

SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (XES) — Down 19.6%

The S&P downgraded Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB in late May. The news dealt a blow to oil service stocks. ""Oilfield services companies will no longer be able to generate the high operating margins they did in 2014,"" S&P analyst Carin Dehne-Kiley said in the note.

Also, Baker Hughes’ data for the week ended May 24, showed that rig count has declined for seven weeks in a row. Market watchers are of the view that “shale producers are cutting back in a bid to conserve capital.”

Global X MSCI China Communication Services ETF (CHIC) — Down 18.4%

This China-centric fund fell prey to trade war tensions. While many China-oriented stocks and ETFs lost massively in the month, the fund CHIC led the way.

Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) — Down 16.4%

U.S. semiconductor stocks have considerable revenue exposure to China. So, escalating trade tensions weighed on this semiconductor fund to a large extent (read: Will Semiconductor ETFs Survive the Huawei Ban?).

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.

Right now, Sanofi is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Pfizer has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SNY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PFE has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.

SNY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.05, while PFE has a forward P/E of 14.91. We also note that SNY has a PEG ratio of 1.89. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PFE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.49.

Another notable valuation metric for SNY is its P/B ratio of 1.52. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PFE has a P/B of 4.03.

These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SNY's Value grade of A and PFE's Value grade of C.

SNY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PFE, so it seems like value investors will conclude that SNY is the superior option right now.

BIQI,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biqi-international-holdings-corp-receives-nasdaq-notification-of-non-compliance-with-listing-rules-300884122.html,"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT","Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",2019-10-03-19-33,Biqi International Holdings Corp. Receives Nasdaq Notification of Non-Compliance with Listing Rules - PRNewswire,"WUHAN CITY, China, July 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Biqi International Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:BIQI) (""Biqi"" or the ""Company""), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, today announced that on July 8, 2019, the Company received notice (the "" Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Notice"") from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") indicating that its Common Shares did not meet the continued listing requirement as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based on the closing bid price of the Common Shares for the preceding 30 business days.

Under Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company received a 180-calendar day grace period from the date of the Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Notice to regain compliance by meeting the continued listing standard of a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day grace period ending on January 6, 2020.

In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), in addition to such initial grace period, the Company could be afforded an additional 180-calendar day compliance period, provided that on the 180th calendar day of the initial grace period, the Company (i) met the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement) and (ii) notified NASDAQ of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency.

Additionally, in a press release issued on May 9, 2019, it was announced that on May 6, 2019 the Company received a letter (the ""Failure to File Notice"") from NASDAQ stating that, because it had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the ""Form 20-F""), it was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Failure to File Notice stated that the Company had until May 20, 2019 to submit to NASDAQ a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In setting the May 20, 2019 deadline for submitting a plan of compliance, the NASDAQ Staff determined to apply more stringent criteria and shorten the normal time period for the Company to submit its plan. The Failure to File Notice stated that if NASDAQ accepted the Company's plan, then NASDAQ could grant the Company up to 180 days from the prescribed due date for filing the Form 20-F to regain compliance.

On May 20, 2019, the Company submitted its plan for compliance for filing the delinquent Form 20-F in which it undertook to file the Form 20-F by July 31, 2019.

On July 10, 2019, the Company received a letter (the ""Delisting Notice"") from NASDAQ advising the Company that its Staff had determined to deny the Company's request for an extension of time to file its Annual Report on Form 20-­F for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to delist the Company's Common Shares for failing to comply with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In addition, the Delisting Notice stated that conflicting public disclosures in the Company's SEC reports had created a lack of clarity regarding the composition of its Board of Directors, as well as its executive management, raising significant concerns regarding the governance of the Company, which the Staff believed constituted a separate and discrete basis for delisting in the exercise of the discretionary authority granted to the Staff by Listing Rule 5101. Listing Rule 5101 states, in part, that NASDAQ ""...has broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities in NASDAQ in order to maintain the quality of and public confidence in its market, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. NASDAQ may use such discretion to deny initial listing, apply additional or more stringent criteria for the initial or continued listing of particular securities, or suspend or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs that makes initial or continued listing of the securities on NASDAQ inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of NASDAQ, even though the securities meet all enumerated criteria for initial or continued listing on NASDAQ.""

The Notice stated that unless the Company requested an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist its Common Shares, trading of the Common Shares will be suspended at the opening of business on July 19, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Company intends to request a hearing with a Hearings Panel at NASDAQ to appeal the delisting determination and to request a stay of the trading suspension pending the outcome of the hearing. In addition, the Company will submit a plan of compliance to regain compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing of the Company's Common Shares with its request for a hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with such requirements.

Looking at individual stocks, Denmark's third-largest bank Jyske Bank soared to the top of the European benchmark after announcing it would lower negative interest rates even further for clients depositing over $111,100 in their bank accounts. The move follows interest rate cuts from both the European and Danish central banks. Shares of the firm rose over 5%.

France's Alten was another standout gainer. The IT services and consulting company reported a better-than-expected operating margin in the first six months of the year, prompting SocGen to raise its stock recommendation to ""buy"" from ""hold."" Shares of the Paris-listed stock jumped 4% on the news.

Meanwhile, Investec slumped to the bottom of the index after issuing a profit warning. The Anglo-South African financial services firm said first-half profit would be lower than a year earlier due to a rise in restructuring costs. Global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty have also weighed on the company. Investec shares sank over 8%.

China cut a key lending rate for the second consecutive month on Friday, following in the footsteps of the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Easier monetary policy has generally supported equities, but most of the interest rate cuts were already priced in and worries about a possible global downturn still linger."

The Delisting Determination stated that unless the Company requests an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist the Company's ADSs, trading of the ADSs will be suspended at the opening of business on September 17, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on the Nasdaq. After due deliberation, the Company does not intend to appeal the Delisting Determination by requesting a hearing before a hearings panel. After the Company is delisted from the Nasdaq, its ADSs may be traded over-the-counter on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the ""pink sheets"" if one or more market makers seeks and obtains approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to continue quoting in the Company's ADSs. Many over-the-counter stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the Nasdaq, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of the Company's ADSs.

This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a Staff delisting determination.

SEATTLE, Aug. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced that the first Cray Shasta™ supercomputing system for operational weather forecasting and meteorology will be acquired by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The powerful high-performance computing capabilities of the new system, named HPC11, will enable higher fidelity weather forecasts for U.S. Air Force and Army operations worldwide. The contract is valued at $25 million.



“We’re excited with our Oak Ridge National Laboratory strategic partner’s selection of Cray to provide Air Force Weather’s next high performance computing system,” said Steven Wert, Program Executive Officer Digital, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, and a member of the Senior Executive Service. “The system’s performance will be a significant increase over the existing HPC capability and will provide Air Force Weather operators with the ability to run the next generation of high-resolution, global and regional models, and satisfy existing and emerging warfighter needs for environmental impacts to operations planning.”

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a history of deploying the world’s most powerful supercomputers and through this partnership, will provide supercomputing-as-a-service on the HPC11 Shasta system to the Air Force 557th Weather Wing. The 557th Weather Wing develops and provides comprehensive terrestrial and space weather information to the U.S. Air Force and Army. The new system will feature the revolutionary Cray Slingshot™ interconnect, with features to better support time-critical numerical weather prediction workloads, and will enhance the Air Force’s capabilities to create improved weather forecasts and weather threat assessments so that Air Force missions can be carried out more effectively.

“The HPC11 system will be the first Shasta delivery to the production weather segment, and we’re proud to share this milestone with ORNL and the Air Force,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO at Cray. “The years of innovation behind Shasta and Slingshot and the success of prior generations of Cray systems continue to demonstrate Cray’s ability to support demanding 24/7 operations like weather forecasting. This is a great example of the upcoming Exascale Era bringing a new set of technologies to bear on challenging problems and empowering the Air Force to more effectively execute on its important mission.”

HPC11 will be ORNL’s first Cray Shasta system, as well as the first supercomputing system with 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ processors for use in operational weather forecasting. HPC11 will join the 85% bastion of weather centers that rely on Cray, and will feature eight Shasta cabinets in a dual-hall configuration.

“We are incredibly excited to continue our strategic collaboration with Cray to deliver the first Shasta supercomputer to the U.S. Air Force, helping to improve the fidelity of weather forecasts for U.S. military operations around the globe,” said Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager, Datacenter and Embedded Systems Group, AMD. “The 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors provide exceptional performance in highly complex workloads, a necessary component to power critical weather prediction workloads and deliver more accurate forecasts.”

The system is expected to be delivered in Q4 2019 and accepted in early 2020.

DFRG,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/06/why-a-suggested-sale-has-shares-of-del-friscos-res.aspx,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT","Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",2019-10-03-19-33,Why a Suggested Sale Has Shares of Del Frisco's Restaurant Popping 12% Thursday - Motley Fool,"What happened?

Shares of Del Frisco's Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:DFRG), owner and operator of high-end restaurant concepts that include Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse, Sullivan's Steakhouse, and Del Frisco's Grille, are up 12% as of 11:51 a.m. EST after Engaged Capital urged the company to explore a sale.

So what

Engaged Capital, a hedge fund that owns just under 10% of DFRG's outstanding shares, drafted a letter that urged management to correct prior strategic missteps that deteriorated value by hiring financial advisors and a strategic review committee to explore a potential sale. The core of Engaged Capital's issue is that the restaurant chain has highly attractive dining concepts, which isn't reflected in the stock valuation. Below is a snippet from Engaged Capital's letter.

DFRG's high leverage, weak and inconsistent operational performance, and value destruction under the current strategy demand quick and decisive action by the Board. It is unacceptable for the Board to ask DFRG shareholders to bear the risk of additional declines in traffic and profitability at Double Eagle and the Grille while hoping that current management will successfully integrate and operate the Barteca concepts (defying a long history of doing otherwise) when we believe there is a far less risky option available: a sale of DFRG today.

Now what

Indeed, DFRG has shed much of its value since its initial public offering (IPO), while a close competitor, Ruth's Hospitality Group (NASDAQ:RUTH), has thrived in comparison. DFRG shares are up 12% today, suggesting investors agree shares are undervalued and that a sale would generate a premium to today's stock price. Engaged Capital believes it to be a seller's market within the restaurant industry, and with merger and acquisition activity recently rewarding restaurant concepts at high valuation multiples, it at least makes sense for DFRG to explore its options."

Qualcomm, Xilinx, Broadcom –Chipmakers were under pressure led by declines in Qualcomm and Xilinx, which tumbled 6% and 3.6%, respectively. Broadcom also dropped 6%. The drop came after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and effectively halted its ability to buy American-made parts and components. This led Google to suspended business activity with the Chinese telecom giant. Other Huawei suppliers, including Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel and Xilinx, will reportedly stop selling to the Huawei until further notice. U.S. chip suppliers are losing a big customer as Huawei purchases $20 billion of semiconductors each year.

Sprint, T-Mobile — Sprint shares surged 18.8% after the Federal Communications Commission's chairman said he would recommend the company's $26.5 billion merger with T-Mobile. T-Mobile shares also rose 3.9%.

Deutsche Bank — The German bank's U.S.-listed shares slid 2% after UBS downgraded it to sell from neutral. The UBS analyst said Deutsche is a ""levered market play vulnerable to external events and rising rates are currently a distant hope.""

Tesla — Tesla dropped 2.3% after a Wedbush analyst lowered its price target on the electric car maker's stock to $230 from $275. The analyst cited concerns that CEO Elon Musk's expansion into other products is distracting the company from what should be its main goal: gathering core demand for its Model 3.

Apple — Shares of Apple slid 3.1% after HSBC cut the tech company's price target to $174 per share from $180 due to concerns over the looming tariff concerns between the U.S. and China. HSBC believes tariff increases would force Apple to raise prices on its products, which are already seen as expensive. The bank also said there is a risk that Chinese consumers would shift to local brands with comparable products such as Huawei and Xiaomi.

Dish Network — Dish shares slid nearly 6% after announcing it will buy streaming company EchoStar's satellite business for $800 million. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019.

Tata Motors — Shares of Indian automaker Tata Motors climbed 5.7% following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings released before the bell Monday. Tata Motors earned $160.26 million in net profit for the quarter ended on March 31, topping a Refinitiv estimate. The company, however, said it struggled to sell its Jaguar Land Rover in key markets like China.

Delta Air Lines — Delta fell 1.1% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight. Morgan Stanley cited concerns that the airline's free cash flow yield is falling, and the investment bank's updated 2020 estimates which are below the consensus estimates.

Ryanair — Europe's low-cost airline Ryanair fell 2.1% after reporting its weakest annual profit in fours years on Monday. Ryanair cited issues with overcapacity, Brexit and problems with the grounded Boeing 737 MAX for its disappointing quarterly results.

Del Frisco's Restaurant — The steakhouse chain's stock skyrocketed 31.2% higher after The Deal reported that final bids for the company were around $9 per share. That number is 89.5% above Del Frisco's closing price on Friday of $4.75.

The Brentwood, Tenn.-based skilled nursing operator had received an initial warning from the exchange in late December, after its market value of listed securities (MVLS) dropped below the mandatory minimum of $35 million for 30 consecutive trading days.

At the time, Diversicare’s management pledged to “consider all available options to regain compliance” with the Nasdaq’s standards, but the exchange’s hearing panel on Wednesday rejected the provider’s attempt to appeal the ruling. Nasdaq suspended trading of Diversicare shares on its exchange effective Thursday.

That same day, the company’s shares migrated to the OTCQX market under its existing ticker symbol of DVCR.

“The Company will remain a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and continue to be subject to the public reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission,” Diversicare noted in the announcement.

The move wasn’t necessarily unexpected: On the company’s second-quarter 2019 earnings call earlier this month, Diversicare CEO Jay McKnight told investors that the company had already received approval to trade on the over-the-counter market amid the ongoing Nasdaq appeal process.

Diversicare, which operates 72 skilled nursing and senior housing facilities, has endured a string of shaky quarters, though McKnight was upbeat this summer after reaching a $9.5 million settlement with the Department of Justice to resolve a long-standing investigation into its therapy practices.

McKnight also touted the company’s strategic decision to exit the Kentucky marketplace and its participation in a Texas program intended to boost Medicaid reimbursement rates, classifying the recent moves as a “near complete reset” of the provider’s operations.

“We’ve made significant changes that we believe will improve our outlook,” he said during the earnings call.

This compares to earnings of $0.05 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.85%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this fiber optic component supplier would post earnings of $0.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of 7.41%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Finisar, which belongs to the Zacks Fiber Optics industry, posted revenues of $310.09 million for the quarter ended April 2019, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $310.07 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Finisar shares have added about 2.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14.9%.

What's Next for Finisar?

While Finisar has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Finisar was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.29 on $328.05 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.35 on $1.41 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Fiber Optics is currently in the top 1% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

By Uday Sampath Kumar

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Early gains on Wall Street fizzled out by afternoon on Monday as losses in technology and healthcare stocks overshadowed increased expectations of stimulus from central banks around the world.

Microsoft Corp and Amgen Inc were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Amgen fell 3.19% after analysts raised questions about data on the company’s lung cancer drug, dragging the healthcare sector down 0.94%.

Lenders, however, were up on broad gains in U.S. Treasury yields on risings bets of an interest rate cut in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s September meeting.

Financial stocks rose 1.20%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, with banks gaining 2.62%. Technology stocks fell more than 1% and were the biggest drag on the benchmark index.

“The markets are continuing last week’s positive sentiment but with a reduction in pessimism and fear,” said Scott Brown chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Stocks gained last week on easing U.S.-China trade negotiations and global political tensions as well as increased hopes of an interest rate cut.

Cementing those expectations, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said late last week the central bank would “act as appropriate” to sustain economic expansion, a phrase that financial markets have read as a sign of an impending of rate cut.

Earlier on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not see the threat of a recession as the Trump administration seeks to revive trade negotiations with China, adding that he expected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy.

Energy stocks led gains among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors with a 1.41% rise, as oil prices got a boost from the new Saudi energy minister committing to output cuts.

At 13:11 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.95 points, or 0.08%, at 26,818.41, the S&P 500 was down 2.34 points, or 0.08%, at 2,976.37 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 22.49 points, or 0.28%, at 8,080.59.

Among other stocks, AT&T Inc gained 2.61% after shareholder Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and pushed for changes.

Boeing Co fell 0.84% after it suspended load testing of its new widebody 777X aircraft over the weekend as media reports said a cargo door failed in a ground stress test.

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

The Sackler family, facing a multitude of lawsuits for helping fuel the nation’s opioid epidemic, has become the largest shareholder in Mount Snow’s parent company, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

And through a series of transactions last year with a company associated with the family, the Sacklers — who control 13% of Peak Resorts’ common stock — now have a path that could lead to owning a majority of the firm.

Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.

The family related company, CAP 1, made a series of loans to Peak Resorts. In return, it received preferred stock and warrants giving it the right to increase its investment under certain circumstances, possibly leading to eventual voting control.

According to a Boston Globe review of securities filings, the Sacklers could only achieve majority ownership if the stock price were to rise considerably — and if the family were to invest tens of millions of dollars in exchange for the shares.

CAP 1 is described in SEC documents as a Delaware investment company owned by a trust in which Beverly Sackler and Purdue Pharma’s former president, Richard Sackler, are beneficiaries. CAP 1 is further described as a client of Sumner Road, an investment management firm headed by Richard’s son, David Sackler.

CAP 1’s ties with Mount Snow are concerning to some locals. The Sacklers and their company Purdue Pharma have faced thousands of lawsuits for deceptively marketing the addictive opioid painkiller Oxycontin. Some museums and nonprofits in other states and abroad have started rejecting their charitable gifts under pressure from protesters. Others have returned gifts and financial donations.

Dover Selectboard member Sarah Shippee said some may boycott Mount Snow in the future.

“I’m horrified by what the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma have been accused of,” Shippee said. “We’ve certainly seen a tremendous amount of damage done by that just in our own community.”

Dover Town Clerk Andrew McLean said residents were conflicted about Purdue Pharma’s involvement in Mount Snow.

“Most Snow has, over the years, been incredibly supportive of our community. We have a good relationship with them,” McLean said. “The opioid crisis and any culpability that family might have there is heartbreaking.”

CAP 1 has owned shares in Peak Resorts since at least 2015, SEC documents show. Prior to last year, CAP 1 owned about 40 percent of the company. In addition to CAP 1’s interest, Richard Sackler owns .7 percent of Peak Resorts, the Richard and Beth Sackler Foundation, Inc. own .2 percent and David Sackler owns .7 percent.

It appears Peak is using the Sacklers’ latest investment to expand.

Peak announced last September that it obtained a $70 million commitment from CAP 1 to acquire Snow Time Inc., which includes three Pennsylvania ski resorts — Liberty Mountain Resort, Whitetail Resort and Roundtop Mountain Resort.

A month later, Peak held a special meeting with stockholders, asking them to approve an agreement in which CAP 1 would provide Peak with a two-year $50 million loan at a 6.95% interest rate. Peak disclosed that CAP 1 would provide another $20 million through the purchase of preferred stock under a 2016 agreement.

That $20 million investment came at the same time that Mount Snow was short on working capital because of delays in receiving money invested through the EB-5 program.

Peak cautioned that moving forward with the agreement contained a number of risks, including that the value of common stock could be reduced and CAP 1 could have the ability to control the outcome of future votes.

Stockholder approval was required under Nasdaq Stock Market rules. The Sackler family wasn’t mentioned at the shareholder meeting or in press releases from Peak Resort last fall. Stockholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the agreement.

The Sacklers and Purdue Pharma have faced more than 1,600 lawsuits for their role in creating Oxycontin.

As Peak Resorts was finalizing the details of the loan with the Sacklers, Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan joined dozens of other states in filing a lawsuit against them and their company last fall.

Vermont’s lawsuit alleges Purdue Pharma has generated $35 billion in sales since Oxycontin was introduced in 1995. It claims Purdue Pharma violated the state’s consumer protection and public nuisance laws and says Purdue lied about Oxycontin’s risks of addiction.

Purdue Pharma made a motion to dismiss the state’s lawsuit, but that request was rejected by a Chittenden County Superior Court judge last month.

“Vermont has been hit pretty hard by the opioid epidemic,” Vermont Attorney General Communications Coordinator Natalie Silver said. “It’s important to talk about corporate responsibility.”

Silver said she was unaware of Purdue Pharma’s involvement with Mount Snow.

Peak Resorts spokesperson Norberto Aja declined to comment about the Sackler’s investment. Aja said the purchase of the Pennsylvania resorts was part of Peak’s growth strategy.

Peak, a Missouri-based company that operates 17 resorts, acquired Mount Snow around 2010.

Rep. John Gannon, D-Wilmington, said Peak has turned the struggling Mount Snow around, with new snowmaking capabilities along with a number of other investments. Peak recently completed a $22 million base lodge at Mount Snow, which features a restaurant, retail space and two bars. That project used EB-5 investment money.

“They’ve been a good community member,” Gannon said. “I’d hate to see the Sacklers’ investment take away from that.”

The Deerfield Valley News, which was first with the news of the SEC filings, reported that some locals questioned how the Sacklers may benefit from town funding. Mount Snow has previously received funding from Dover’s 1% local option tax to use toward events.

As lawsuits mount, organizations around the world are criticizing the Sackler family. They’ve been named one of the wealthiest families in America and faced condemnation for making their wealth from an addictive drug. Some art institutions have refused to accept money from the Sacklers. Others have even returned gifts.

Facing pressure, the Sackler family suspended all philanthropic giving in the United Kingdom last month.

“The current press attention that these legal cases in the United States is generating has created immense pressure on the scientific, medical, educational and arts institutions here in the U.K., large and small, that I am so proud to support,” Sackler Trust chair Dame Theresa Sackler said in a statement. “This attention is distracting them from the important work that they do.”

Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-West Dover, was hopeful Mount Snow’s high regard in the community would continue, despite the negativity surrounding the Sackler name.

“Mount Snow provides products, employment, and services that many other valley businesses leverage and many employees live off of and that has resulted in many other investments in our valley,” said Sibilia in a statement as she condemned Purdue. “What Purdue Pharma is accused of is abhorrent. The level of human suffering and loss associated with the over-prescription and profiting of prescription opioids is unfathomable.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story, and an accompanying headline, referred inaccurately to the size of the Sackler family’s stake in Peak Resorts. While it is the largest shareholder, the family does not control a majority of the company’s common stock.

Reed has been one of the biggest topics of conversation for Seahawks fans in 2019 not because we were aware of an impending six-game ban or appeal but due to Reed’s upcoming free agency and an extension.

An extension looks unlikely any time soon. How will Seattle move forward with Reed?

One thing that works in Pete Carroll and John Schneider’s favor here is that Reed’s interaction with police that ultimately led us here happened two and a half years ago. That means that the Seahawks have had like 30 months to come up with a contingency plan — and it’s fair to say now that Carroll and Schneider’s moves this year indicate that they were ready. Not because they are especially deep at defensive tackle (they aren’t) but they did add six notable defensive linemen — Demarcus Christmas, Al Woods, Jamie Meder, Cassius Marsh, L.J. Collier, and Ziggy Ansah — while knocking on the doors of guys like Ahtyba Rubin.

The team let Shamar Stephen walk and traded Frank Clark, but those are the only two real losses; the loss of Clark feels antithetical to a Reed suspension because you want to have as much talent on the defensive line as possible, but you don’t turn down a first and second round pick and pay a player $105 million because you’re going to be without a defensive tackle for six games. And it just may not feel like a good idea to extend Frank Clark to a deal like that months before one of his teammates is suspended six games for an incident related to domestic violence.

What does this all mean for Reed’s own free agency in 2020?

The suspension might seem to indicate that Reed will be easier to re-sign to a new contract, but I’m not sure that this works in Seattle’s favor. Without this suspension, Reed may have been looking at an elite-level contract for a defensive tackle: as noted last week, Grady Jarrett of the Atlanta Falcons signed a four-year, $68 million deal and it’s not hard to envision Reed topping that.

Or at least, it wasn’t.

The Seahawks could negotiate with Reed during the season to maybe come to an agreement that gives him security, an opportunity, and alleviates some financial obligations on the part of the team. But my immediate thought on that idea is that Reed should never and probably would never accept it. The fact is that Reed could play 10 games and by the end of the year, most have forgotten that he was ever suspended.

I actually don't imagine that this suspension will have an affect on Jarran Reed's future compensation. — Field Gulls (@FieldGulls) July 22, 2019

If that becomes the case, then Reed shouldn’t expect anything less than a franchise tag, which would be around $16 million for 2020. And I still don’t think I’d expect less than a franchise tag.

While with the Chicago Bears in 2016, Alshon Jeffery was suspended four games for violating the league’s PED policy. He returned, played 12 games, had 52 catches for 821 yards, and became a free agent. In this case, Jeffery’s suspension did come back to bite him because the best bet on himself he found was a one-year, $14 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles.

In this case, you can see that the suspension did hurt Jeffery, on top of some other issues, but he still got a franchise tag-type of deal. This also meant that the Bears didn’t get the same type of compensatory credit that they would have gotten had Jeffery signed a five-year, $66 million contract instead. And that’s basically what Jeffery ended up signing:

After proving to be quite valuable in Philly’s offense and that he wasn’t a lesser player post-PEDs, the Eagles gave him a four-year, $52 million extension.

Jeffery was fine. The Eagles were fine. But the Bears wound up with nothing. It’s not exactly a rosy picture for Seattle’s forecast but the two situations are not exactly the same. Reed’s suspension is for something that most humans consider to be a worse offense — and this has nothing to do with the specific details in his case, only with the types of suspensions, so we don’t need to talk about the details right now, just the types of suspensions and Reed’s is worse.

So many players have been hit with PED suspensions that we kind of just gloss it over and move on. Julian Edelman’s doing fine, right?

There’s another comparison that’s much closer to Reed’s situation but it hasn’t concluded yet as far as the next contract goes. In 2017, Ezekiel Elliott served a six-game suspension for an incident related to domestic violence. In both cases, the NFL took a long time to make a decision and to eventually land on a six-game ban after appeal. In both cases, there weren’t any charges pressed against the player.

Elliott eventually served his suspension and when he returned for a full campaign in 2018, he led the NFL in rushing yards and touches. The only debates raging around Elliott’s contract situation with the Dallas Cowboys is whether or not running backs matter. There must be internal discussions regarding the risk of signing Elliott and seeing another incident or suspension, but externally the world seems to have moved on. This must be somewhat related to the fact that there is no video evidence against Elliott like there has been for some other players around the league, and most fans are completely unaware of what the allegations actually were at the time. I imagine the same will happen for Reed since there’s no video and no charges.

So I imagine that the world will move on for Jarran Reed too.

We're just gonna be out here pretending that Ezekiel Elliott doesn't exist, I see. https://t.co/3HJgzZtSEg — Field Gulls (@FieldGulls) July 22, 2019

At this point, Seattle’s plan might just be for Reed to serve his suspension and to observe the snaps going to his replacements, hoping for reasons to be optimistic about a future with Poona Ford and Quinton Jefferson in the middle. If the Seahawks never planned to extend Reed, then at least they get an early preview of a Reed-less line, which is the closest thing I can find to a silver lining when you lose your best pass rusher.

Then it’s just watching how Reed plays. Which doesn’t really change the expectation for 2019 at all, right?

All most have been saying for the whole year before today was that the team should wait and see how Reed plays given that his 10.5-sack season was such an outlier from his first two years. If in that 10 games Reed puts up five sacks, then that likely makes him an attractive free agent, and Seattle could either extend him, tag him, or let him walk and potentially receive a good compensatory draft pick. Just like they would have before.

If in that 10 games Reed struggles, then it could be the push that gives the Seahawks an opportunity to re-sign him to a one-year deal to improve his stock or a reason to not worry that much if he leaves.

After going through the possibilities, I don’t think this suspension changes much for Reed’s future compensation. The information about his incident goes back over two years and as far as we know, there aren’t other incidents in that time. There will be no shortage of teams vying for his services if Reed has 5+ sacks next season. The biggest impact here will be on the first six games and without Reed, the Seahawks could be in competition for worst defensive line in the league.

Last year, they opened with Clark, Reed, Tom Johnson, and Jefferson. Stephen replaced Johnson in Week 2, but Clark and Reed went on to finish with 23.5 sacks.

Now that Reed is suspended and Ansah is probable to miss the start of the season, a Week 1 defensive line could feature L.J. Collier, Ford, Woods or Meder or Rubin, and perhaps Marsh or Jacob Martin or Rasheem Green. Maybe after six games we’re so excited about Collier and Ford and Martin that we’re not even thinking about Reed, but going into the season it will be one of the least-experienced, least-expensive, and least-intimidating defensive lines in the NFL.

The Seahawks were already in a position for 2019 to observe which young players are long-term pieces of the franchise and which ones aren’t. Reed’s absence from September 8-October 13 increases those opportunities for players looking to hang on long-term and decreases Seattle’s talent up front, but ultimately may not change much beyond that."

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features updated research reports on 16 major stocks, including Home Depot (HD), Abbott (ABT) and Bristol-Myers (BMY). These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Home Depot’s shares have gained +21% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Retail Building Products industry’s +19.5% increase. The Zacks analyst thinks that this is attributable to a robust earnings surprise trend recorded for more than five years, which continued in second-quarter fiscal 2019.

Earnings benefited from progress on strategic investments as well as a favorable U.S. consumer backdrop and a steady housing market. Meanwhile, the company’s top line lagged estimates but improved year over year on robust comps performance. Its efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience to customers, with innovative products and improved productivity, position it for growth.

Despite these gains, lumber price deflation remained a drag on the company’s sales and comps in the fiscal second quarter. Further, it slashed its sales and comps view for fiscal 2019 on lumber price deflation and fears of potential impacts of the newly enacted tariffs.

(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>> ).

Shares of Abbott have gained +30.2% over the past year, significantly outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry, which has increased +3.2% over the same period. Abbott exited second quarter 2019 with better-than-expected earnings. However, revenues lagged the estimates.

The Zacks analyst is optimistic about the strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance. The company has been hogging the limelight within Diabetic Care on growth with FreeStyle Libre. This apart, synergies from Alere consolidation in the form of Rapid Diagnostics have been driving growth. Within Structural Heart, worldwide uptake of MitraClip therapy improves further.

Meanwhile, the company’s emerging market performance has been promising. Consequently, Abbott has raised its full-year guidance. On the flip side, sluggish Rhythm Management arm in the United States continues to dent growth. Increasing currency headwind is another downside.

(You can read the full research report on Abbott here >>> ).

Bristol-Myers’ shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the year-to-date period, losing -8.7% vs. -2.1%. The Zacks analyst thinks Bristol-Myers’ lead immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, continues to drive growth. Label expansion of Opdivo into additional indications should further boost the top line. Empliciti and Sprycel are also performing well.

Bristol-Myers also has presence in other core therapeutic areas, including immunoscience and cardiovascular. Blood thinner drug, Eliquis, is expected to drive further growth, propelled by increased share in the novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) market.

The impending acquisition of Celgene Corporation will broaden Bristol-Myers’ oncology portfolio with the addition of blockbuster drug, Revlimid. However, pipeline setbacks are a concern. The failure of the part 2 of the Checkmate-227 study was disappointing, given the potential in the NSCLC market.

Fallout from Dealing with Tariffs

A Record Low

Cannondale, GT, Mongoose, and Schwinn's parent company, Dorel Industries, have announced that they will suspend their third-quarter dividend due to the impact of increased U.S. imposed tariffs, according to Yahoo Finance . The move comes as a result of Dorel's Board of Directors reviewing their preliminary third-quarter earnings and upon the release of the news on Tuesday, Dorel's stock fell 23% to its lowest price since 1996. The dividend declared on August 2nd, 2019 is not affected and will be paid on October 2, 2019. In addition to bicycles, Dorel owns companies related to juvenile products and home furnishings.Tariffs were first implemented on Chinese imports over a year ago. Dorel were able to ride out the first wave of tariffs at 10% but in May tariffs were increased a second time to 25% and the issues started to hit.The strain of tariffs and the fallout from dealing with them seem to have hit Dorel hard.According to Marketwatch , Dorel raised prices midway into the third quarter in an effort to mitigate financial impacts of tariffs, however, that had ""several negative consequences"" on its business. Those consequences include not all retailers raising prices at the same time, which disrupted the retail marketplace, retailers changed their buying routines from suppliers, and new price points caused consumers to opt for different items, creating a ""considerable product mix imbalance. Additionally, there have been increased warehousing costs as product demand changes have had impacts on the company's inventory balancing program.“The impact of the increase on Dorel businesses was still unclear at the end of the second quarter. We raised prices midway through the third quarter and this has had several negative consequences. Not all competitors nor retailers raised prices at the same time or rate. Retailers have also changed their buying routines. New price points have caused some consumers to opt for different items creating a considerable product mix imbalance. As well, elevated warehousing costs are still being incurred as the shift in demand has delayed our inventory balancing program. The net result of these challenges is that Dorel Home’s expected gross margin improvement from first-half levels will be delayed to the beginning of 2020,” explained Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz.Also affecting Dorel's business is that some U.S. customers have delayed their Christmas 2019 deliveries to the beginning of the fourth quarter, Additionally, the recent rise in value of the U.S. dollar has negatively impacted Dorel's sports segments as major currencies that affect Dorel's financial results have dropped between 3% and 8%, according to Yahoo Finance.Dorel states that sales have remained strong with their mass merchants however, gross margins are lower. On a more positive note, independent bicycle retailers and sporting good channels have continued to have strong sales and a positive outlook.After the news broke on Tuesday, Dorel's stock plummeted 32%, over the course of the day, closing at $6.18 - the lowest value ever. On Wednesday, at the time of publishing this article, Dorel's stock was even lower, valued at 6$ after dipping to a low of $5.77. Additionally, there have been massive exchanges of shares - A volume of over 331,000 shares changed hands on Tuesday. In comparison, last Tuesday, a little over 20,000 shares were traded.Read more: Giant Declares Made in China Era Over, Citing Trump Tariffs.

Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague announced Wednesday the immediate suspension of the OhioCrypto.com website, which allowed businesses in the state to pay taxes in bitcoin, which was later converted into U.S. dollars, by blockchain payments provider BitPay.

Sprague’s office believes that the website falls under the definition of a “financial transaction device” and that BitPay should have been authorized by the Board of Deposit, which consists of the Attorney General, Auditor of State, and Treasurer of State.

“Until a formal opinion is issued by the Attorney General, I feel it is prudent to suspend the website,” said Sprague, adding that he remains committed to embracing innovative new technologies and processes.

The cryptocurrency tax payment method was introduced in the state by then-Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel. At the time, the facility was reportedly expected to be made available to individuals too in the future. However, it seems to have got no traction with businesses. Sprague said in the 10 months since OhioCrypto.com’s launch, fewer than 10 businesses have chosen to pay taxes through this method."

LexaGene Holdings Inc., (OTC: LXXGF), a biotechnology company that develops genetic analyzers designed to rapidly detect pathogens, mold and other molecular markers, recently placed a beta unit at CDX Analytics, an independent testing laboratory in Massachusetts. Tests use a method called polymerase chain reaction to identify the DNA contained in the sample to identify contaminants.

CDX is the first cannabis testing laboratory in Massachusetts to adopt a DNA-based microbial detection technique.

“The advantage of genetic testing is that it is extremely sensitive and allows for the detection of pathogens, whether they are alive or dead. Although the industry is most concerned with live pathogens — the presence of dead pathogens is indicative of a contaminated product that should be ideally scrapped and if not — much more thoroughly tested to make sure it is safe for consumption,” said Dr. Jack Regan, CEO and founder of LexaGene.

(“Shutterfly”) (NASDAQ GS: SFLY) common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of Shutterfly by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (collectively, “Apollo”) announced on June 10, 2019 (the “Complaint”).

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / October 2, 2019 / Stabilis Energy, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SLNG) (""Stabilis"") common shares will begin trading on the OTC market under the symbol SLNG as of October 3, 2019. This move follows The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC's (""Nasdaq"") decision to suspend trading of SLNG on that same date due to failure to meet certain initial listing requirements. Quotes can be found at www.otcmarkets.com.

Stabilis believes that it currently meets the applicable listing requirements on other stock exchanges and has already initiated the process for listing its common shares on another exchange. Stabilis believes that it could be approved to be listed on another exchange as early as October 2019. However, such approval is not automatic and cannot be assured.

""The Stabilis growth strategy remains as strong as ever. We currently are executing on projects that will bring new small-scale LNG production and distribution assets to the North American market, including significant opportunities in Mexico,"" commented Jim Reddinger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stabilis. ""Stabilis is a high-quality public company that currently meets the listing standards for multiple stock exchanges. We are confident that SLNG will soon be listed on an exchange that supports the Company's trading and liquidity needs.""

Nasdaq notified Stabilis on October 1, 2019, that it will suspend Stabilis' shares from trading on that exchange as of October 3, 2019, due to failure to meet certain initial listing requirements relating to its recently completed business combination with American Electric Technologies, Inc. (""AETI""). Stabilis appealed Nasdaq's decision based on the fact that the Company currently meets all of Nasdaq's initial and continuing listing requirements that were in effect when its transaction with AETI was completed on July 26, 2019. The Company has also taken steps to comply with new Nasdaq listing requirements that were enacted after the AETI transaction was completed, including filing a resale registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite these actions to bring the Company into full compliance, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel chose to proceed with the trading suspension. Nasdaq will complete the delisting process after applicable appeal periods have lapsed.

A call to discuss the listing changes described above will be held on Wednesday, October 2, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. eastern time (9:00 a.m. central). Individuals in the United States and Canada who wish to participate in the conference call should dial +1 844-369-8770. International callers should dial +1 862-298-0840.

A replay of the call will be available until October 7, 2019. Individuals in the United States and Canada who wish to listen to the replay should dial +1 877-481-4010; passcode 53859. International callers should dial +1 919-882-2331; passcode 53859.

A replay of the call also will be available on the Stabilis website (www.stabilisenergy.com).

About Stabilis Energy

Stabilis Energy, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of distributed liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") production, distribution and fueling services to multiple end markets in North America. We have safely delivered over 200 million gallons of LNG through more than 20,000 truck deliveries during our 15-year operating history, which we believe makes us one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America. We provide LNG to customers in diverse end markets, including the industrial, energy, mining, utility, pipeline, commercial, and high horsepower transportation markets. Our customers use LNG as an alternative to traditional fuel sources, such as distillate fuel oil and propane, to lower fuel costs and reduce harmful environmental emissions. Our customers also use LNG as a ""virtual pipeline"" solution when natural gas pipelines are not available or are curtailed. To learn more, visit www.stabilisenergy.com.

(NASDAQ:SLNG), a vertically integrated provider of small-scale liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production, distribution and fueling services to multiple end markets in North America, today announced that it received a staff determination letter from the listing qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Nasdaq Stock Market”) on July 30, 2019 setting forth a determination to delist the Company’s common stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market as a result of the Company’s inability to satisfy Nasdaq Listing Rule 5505(a)(2), which requires a minimum of 1,000,000 publicly held shares, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5505(b)(1)(B), which requires a minimum market value of $15 million in publicly held shares.

Upon the completion of the share exchange of the Company with Stabilis Energy LLC and its subsidiaries on July 26, 2019, which resulted in a change of control of the Company, the Company did not satisfy all of the applicable Nasdaq standards to complete the Nasdaq initial listing process.

The Company intends to request a hearing with a Nasdaq hearings panel to appeal the staff’s delisting determination and request an extension to allow the Company to meet all the applicable listing standards in accordance with a compliance plan it will present. The Company intends to pursue certain actions outlined in its compliance plan to increase the number of publicly held shares as soon as practical to meet the applicable listing requirements; however, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to do so within the period of time that may be granted by the hearings panel.

The appeal will stay any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process and the expiration of any extension period that may be granted to the Company by the hearings panel.

This announcement is made in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b) which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a staff delisting determination.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting.

The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019.

There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

YRIV,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yangtze-river-port-and-logistics-limited-yriv-provides-the-accurate-details-regarding-hindenburgs-research-report-300764685.html,"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT","Wed, 12 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",2019-10-03-19-34,Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (YRIV) Provides the Accurate Details Regarding Hindenburg's Research Report - PRNewswire,"""The unconstructed part of the project is a planned ""Logistics Center"" that YRIV states it will build on 1.2 million square meters of land leased from a local village. On YRIV's latest quarterly balance sheet, the rights to the land are reported as having a value of $299 million, comprising over 77% of the company's total assets… Despite claiming to lease 1.2 million square meters from the village, our government-sourced maps…show that the total area of the village is only 610 thousand square meters. Moreover, conversations with officials from the village in question revealed that contrary to the company's claims, YRIV has not leased any land from them.""

The value of $299 million reflected in the Company's latest quarterly balance sheet is not related to the 1.2 million square meters of land. Instead, the reported value of $299 million relates to the value of land use rights of the unused portion of 6 parcels of commercial land (steel logistics park). Originally, the value of these land use rights of the 6 parcels of commercial land totaling 515,600 square meters, was booked at a cost of $308 million , of which 79,200 square meters of land have been used for constructing commercial buildings with 92,700 square meters of floor area, leaving 436,400 square meters of unused land. It is this unused piece of land that we have reported a value of $299 million . As of today, due to the significant appreciation of the local real estate market, we estimate that the 515,600 square meters of land that the Company has obtained land use right certificates for and was accounted at cost value, has nearly doubled to a value of nearly $600 million .

The Company's lease of 1.2 million square meters of land mentioned in the Report comprises land not only from the Chunfeng Village but also Junmin Village and Jiangdi Village, which were brokered and represented through Chunfeng Village.

2. Undisclosed Legal Judgments

A list of the 11 undisclosed legal judgments mentioned in the Report is set forth below:

Items 1-6 relate to the litigation and judgements arising from the sale of commercial house flats by the Company's subsidiary, Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd. (""Wuhan Newport""). These commercial house flats were sold in or before 2015. According to the relevant contracts of sale, if Wuhan Newport fails to develop the area in accordance with its original development plan within one year after the sale and purchase, Wuhan Newport would have to repurchase the commercial house flats at the original contracted price back from the purchasers. These proceedings were instituted by the purchasers before the said properties appreciated and doubled in value between 2017 and 2018. Consequently, the purchasers are now reluctant to enforce the judgments and sell back the properties to Wuhan Newport. The Company has already made provisions for the purchase of the properties in the financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Because the judgments were already rendered, the Company has not disclosed these judgements as ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Item 7 refers to the loan of RMB 290 million due to China Construction Bank Gangcheng Branch dated May 28, 2014 mentioned in the Report, plus interest totaling approximately RMB 325 million , and not in addition to such loan. The loan and interest payable obligations have been disclosed and accounted for in the Company's financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2017 .

10. LOANS PAYABLE

The Company is in the process of negotiating a loan restructure with the bank and in the meantime, all payments due are suspended. Also, as a result of negotiations, the bank has not instituted enforcement proceedings. As in the above Items 1-6, because a judgement has already been rendered, the Company has not disclosed it as an ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Items 8-11 refer to judgements obtained against Wuhan Newport as a guarantor for certain loans taken out by a large shareholder of Wuhan Newport before it became a subsidiary of the Company. Since the judgments were rendered, the shareholder has undertaken in writing to be solely responsible for all these loans without recourse to Wuhan Newport and has entered into a repayment plan with his creditor(s). Accordingly, no enforcement actions have been instituted against Wuhan Newport and in accordance with legal opinion from PRC counsel, there are no legal or financial liability accorded to Wuhan Newport.

3. Money from YRIV's Capital Raises Has Been Used to Pay the Chairman/Controlling Shareholder Rather Than Advance Company's Projects

The Report alleges that the Company has consistently reported large liability balances ""due to related parties"" on its financial statements. These, in turn, seem to accrue large interest rates which simply get added to the ""advances"" over time. When capital is raised, cash is then used to pay back the supposed related-party ""advances"", rather than being employed to further the company's projects.

Ever since the closing of the reverse merger in December 2015 , the Company has taken out 19 short-term loans via convertible notes totaling $8.546 million . The money from these loans was mainly used for paying the proposed upfront deposit payments for acquiring another entity, Wuhan Economic Development Port Limited (""Wuhan Port EDP""). Because the acquisition of Wuhan Port EDP as aborted, the Company began repaying the convertible notes from the loan proceeds. As of the end of November 2018 , the Company has repaid $9.031 million ( $7.846 million in principal plus $1.184 million in interest), leaving an unpaid principal of $699,000 .

Contrary to the Report, the Company's CEO, Mr. Xiangyao Liu has not only not received a penny from these loans but has advanced as much as $485,000 towards the payment of the $9.031 million by the Company and will likewise advance the forthcoming redemption of an unexpired principal of $699,000 plus interest.

Hindenburg quoted the following from the Company's Quarter Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 :

The Report concluded that there was a total repayment of ""loans"" of approximately $6.2 million to Mr. Liu. This is not the case. The Report focused on the numbers highlighted in the red circles but neglected the increased amounts highlighted in the green circles which showed increased advances from Mr. Liu to the Company. The net effect of the aforementioned numbers shows a net advance from Mr. Liu to the Company. In addition, as mentioned in the Report, ""the total amount of those 19 convertible notes amounted to $8.5 million, of which $3.39 million is outstanding while $5.15 million has been redeemed."" As such, there is no way that Mr. Liu would have received $6.2 million from the proceeds of the notes.

""The Report contains numerous errors of facts and misleading speculations that are libelous and we categorically deny such speculations. This Report is largely a rehash of prior allegations made against us and only focuses on certain discrete information to cultivate a distorted view of the Company"", said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ""We have not granted access to Hindenburg nor has Hindenberg ever contacted us to seek any clarification or explanation to the allegations made. These speculations have caused significant damage to our Company and we are resolved to take such actions necessary to defend ourselves and protect the interests of our shareholders. Additionally, we have instructed counsel to explore our recourse against Hindenburg for making such irresponsible, baseless and libelous statements, including but not limited to instituting legal proceedings against them. We are committed to a high level of corporate governance and stand by the integrity of our financial statements and business operations. We will be conducting a special internal investigation into the other allegations made and will report the outcome of such investigation in due course.""
