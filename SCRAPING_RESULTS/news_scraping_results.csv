This compares to break-even earnings per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 66.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this hybrid vehicle drivetrain maker would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.02, delivering no surprise.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.
Adomani, which belongs to the Zacks Electric Construction industry, posted revenues of $1.18 million for the quarter ended December 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 64.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $0.43 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call .
Adomani shares have added about 72.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.7%.
What's Next for Adomani?
While Adomani has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power o f earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Adomani was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.03 on $2.93 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.09 on $16.03 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electric Construction is currently in the top 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This hybrid vehicle drivetrain maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +50%.
Revenues are expected to be $2.06 million, up 347.8% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Adomani?
For Adomani, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Adomani will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Adomani would post a loss of $0.03 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.01, delivering a surprise of +66.67%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Adomani doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Let's take a look at why trivago (NASDAQ: TRVG) , Equifax (NYSE: EFX) , and Adomani (NASDAQ: ADOM) were put in the kennel and see if there's any chance of letting these dogs out once September ends.
Image source: Getty Images.
trivago (down 26%)
Online hotel reservation site trivago lost more than a quarter of its value over the last 30 days, but it's also lost more than half of its value after hitting its apex at the end of July. The problem is, business keeps getting worse than it previously expected.
In the an update to the guidance it issued at the end of the second quarter, trivago said revenue growth would only be up 40% for all of 2017, compared to the 50% it previously said it would be. And that was worse than the 67% growth it enjoyed during the quarter. It all amounts to what seems to be a sudden deceleration in its business as the revenue it generates from each qualified referral developed from its hotel search platform is significantly worse than it expected.
These heightened costs are what caused trivago to turn a first-quarter profit into a second-quarter loss of 3.4 million euros. Selling and marketing expenses soared 60% during the period and continued to eat up more than 90% of its total revenue. That's no way to run a railroad or a travel site, and investors apparently thought now was the time to hop off this train before it completely derailed.

Equifax (down 24%)
Only Rip Van Winkle would not know what credit reporting bureau Equifax lost a third of its value, all of which occurred in the month of September. It suffered a massive security breach that exposed the most sensitive credit information about 143 million Americans to hackers.
What made it worse was its slow, clumsy response to the hacking incident. First it was revealed that three executives sold millions of dollars' worth of stock in the days after Equifax first learned of the breach. Although the credit bureau said the executives had no knowledge of the incident prior to their sales, it certainly looks suspicious and investigations are being launched into insider trading.
Then Equifax offered to provide credit monitoring for anyone affected by the security breach, but it only gave people a code they would have to wait several days to use to learn whether they were one of the 143 million affected. That would potentially expose millions of people to having their information used fraudulently.
Equifax remedied that one only to open up another by initially requiring people to give up all rights to sue the company if they signed up for the monitoring program. As outrage exploded over social media that people would be forced into arbitration for the problem Equifax caused, the company ended up removing the verbiage.
But that wasn't all. Equifax then tried to shift blame to the company that makes the software for its online databases as having a flaw that allowed the intruder in, but open-source software maker Apache Software Foundation said it had put out a patch for the hole in the Apache Struts program months ago and before the breach happened. Equifax never updated its software with the patch.
Needless to say, Equifax's reputation has been damaged but following the resignation of its CEO, the reporting bureau got a bit of bounce that took it from being down 33% to 24%.

Adomani (down 47%)
Hard to imagine anyone having a worse month than Equifax, but then there's auto parts maker Adomani, which has lost almost half of its value. While there was no real reason for the decline, the maker of drivetrains for electric and zero-emission vehicles is newly public and used a dubious tool for its IPO, making it a risky play.
Adomani is one of only a handful of companies that have made use of Regulation A+ that allows a business to go public by raising small amounts of cash from individuals and customers. In fact, big investment houses are barred from participating.
While Adomani had the distinction of being the first company to list on the Nasdaq exchange using the process in June, it raised only about $14 million. That's really a piddling amount in the world of IPOs, and it's going to make its stock highly volatile, which it has been.
Investing in Adomani is especially risky because the company has no current revenue. Investors must make a leap of faith that management will be able to successfully capitalize on its game plan.
Other companies are planning on using the Reg A+ route to go public and their offerings are going to be equally dicey. For example, better-burger chain Fatburger plans to IPO offering only a very small portion of the company's outstanding shares, meaning the Fat Brands parent will remain firmly in control of the business.
While it's a great opportunity for small, emerging businesses to gain access to investor capital -- more so than usual for such companies -- these businesses are definitely a case of buyer beware.

The Dow Jones Industrials hit another record, but the Nasdaq Composite finished down on the day. The long bull market in stocks has benefited from low interest rates, but market participants today started to speculate that further increases in rates from the Federal Reserve might come sooner than hoped. In addition, some companies suffered from bad news that sent their share prices lower, and Opko Health (NASDAQ: OPK) , Avis Budget Group (NASDAQ: CAR) , and Adomani (NASDAQ: ADOM) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Opko's slump continues
Shares of Opko Health fell another 7%, adding to its poor performance throughout 2017 . Opko has had to deal with disappointment on multiple fronts, including less-than-encouraging results in clinical studies and slow starts for approved drugs. Yet even though several institutional investors have thrown in the towel and given up on the company, Opko has strong potential for sales of its chronic kidney disease treatment Rayaldee to pick up. Moreover, Opko's diagnostic testing business has good prospects as well. Although the company hasn't executed well yet, some are optimistic that the future is bright for Opko .

Avis stalls out
Avis Budget Group stock dropped almost 7% in sympathy with other rental car specialists, as analysts issued a downbeat outlook for the industry. Some had believed that with the widespread damage to vehicles caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, better conditions in the used car market could lift shares of Avis and its peers going forward. Yet analysts at Morgan Stanley think that the run higher for Avis' primary competitor was overdone and cut their rating in response. Even though Avis wasn't directly the subject of that critique, it faces many of the same challenges , and it will be tough for Avis to succeed where its rivals are failing.
Adomani isn't going anywhere
Finally, shares of Adomani fell another 21%, bring its losses over the past week to about 40%. The zero-emission electric vehicle technology specialist just came public in June, and it marked the first time that a company used the new Regulation A+ process for small companies to go public. Yet the stock has been extremely volatile, climbing from an offering price of $5 per share all the way to $17 before going through some turbulent moves both up and down in the interim. Opinions vary widely about the company's business model and ability to stand up to much larger competitors, and today's move downward highlights the risk level of investing in a start-up in such a critical and fast-moving industry.

This compares to break-even earnings per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 66.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this hybrid vehicle drivetrain maker would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.02, delivering no surprise.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.
Adomani, which belongs to the Zacks Electric Construction industry, posted revenues of $1.18 million for the quarter ended December 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 64.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $0.43 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call .
Adomani shares have added about 72.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.7%.
What's Next for Adomani?
While Adomani has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power o f earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Adomani was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.03 on $2.93 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.09 on $16.03 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electric Construction is currently in the top 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

AMR, +0.00% slid 14% to match its record closing price Thursday, after the Houston-based oil and gas development company said it filed for bankruptcy. The company said that despite progress in cutting costs and improving well results, it continued to operate against ""a historically challenging commodity price environment"" and a capital markets environment that is ""highly constrained for energy companies."" Separately, the company said it promoted Mark Castiglione to chief executive, replacing interim-CEO Jim Hackett, who resumed his role as executive chairman. Castiglione was previously interim executive vice president of strategy and corporate development.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).
Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.
Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Independent energy company Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. has cut more staff at its Houston facility, just one week after receiving a delisting warning from NASDAQ.
Independent energy company Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. has cut more staff at its Houston facility, just one week after receiving a delisting warning from NASDAQ.
Alta Mesa cut another 13 employees on April 9, according to a letter sent to the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC). This comes after the company laid off 58 workers in February.
The company said the entire Houston facility is not being closed.
Alta Mesa has been embattled with layoffs recently as well as writing down the value of its assets by $3.1 billion – and most recently – its delisting warning.
According to an SEC filing dated April 8, Alta Mesa received a warning from NASDAQ on April 2 that the company was not in compliance with NASDAQ’s listing rule because the it “did not timely file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.”
On April 3, Alta Mesa received a letter from NASDAQ stating the company’s bid price for common stock closed below the minimum $1 per share requirement for the previous 30 consecutive business days.
Alta Mesa was given 180 days to regain compliance. During the compliance period, the its common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
“In this challenging environment, we believe it is important to increase our liquidity to ensure we have adequate financial flexibility,” Alta Mesa’s interim CEO James Hackett said in a company statement dated April 8. “We will continue to explore our options to strengthen our balance sheet, including options to address our indebtedness.”

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.
Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”
Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.
Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”
