In recent years, the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and the STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko, Canadian and Kingfisher) basins drew producers and private equity firms willing to wager billions of dollars on what many considered the next Permian basin, the largest and most prolific U.S. oilfield.

(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2R3NhN5)

But while their many layers of oil mimicked the Permian, the region’s geology proved more inconsistent, undercutting results and making it a higher-cost U.S. shale area for producers.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc, which turned a $3.8 billion investment in the oilfield into under $30 million in just two years, last month said it may not be able to pay creditors.

Others are downsizing: Devon Energy Corp, for example, cut capital spending earmarked for its STACK position to 20% of the total in 2019 from 31% in 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on company presentations. The reallocation aims to improve cash flow from the STACK while focusing investment where returns are better, spokesman Tim Hartley said.

Cimarex Energy also forecasts a cut in spending, to 15% in the region in 2019, down from 30% last year, company presentations showed.

“Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year,” Thomas Jorden, chief executive of Cimarex, said in a first-quarter earnings call.

Producers also are narrowing development to areas where wells have produced better results: Marathon Oil Corp and Continental Resources both have anchored recent activity on two sub-areas - the STACK-Meramec and the SCOOP Woodford.

STRUGGLERS

Geology has stymied hopes for a “Permian Jr”: Exploration wells pointed toward uniform rocks that produced high levels of oil, but producers instead encountered more complexity underground, and production weighted toward gas - at a time of a global glut and stubbornly low prices for the commodity.

“The SCOOP/STACK is not a traditional shale play, so when you think about developing it, there are a number of different rock types,” said Denise Yee, vice president at consultancy RS Energy Group. “As it’s so complex, the hydrocarbon mix changes across the play, and the oil window is limited.”

Another disappointment has been poorer results from subsequent wells. Perhaps more than any other U.S. shale basin, the SCOOP/STACK has suffered from a condition known as the “parent/child” well problem, where secondary wells produce less oil than the original.

These problems are reflected in a higher median breakeven price needed to cover costs in the SCOOP and STACK, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

(Reuters) - Supercomputer manufacturer Cray Inc said on Friday it would be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co in a deal valued at about $1.30 billion, net of cash.

The $35 per share value represents a premium of 17.4% to Cray’s last close.

HPE said it expects the deal to increase its footprint in federal business and academia, and sell supercomputing products to its commercial clients.

The deal, expected to close by the first quarter of HPE’s fiscal year 2020, will add to its adjusted operating profit in the first full year after closing.

As part of the deal, HPE expects to incur one-time integration costs that will be absorbed within its fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion that remains unchanged.

Seattle-headquartered Cray has U.S.-based manufacturing operations and about 1,300 employees worldwide. It earned $456 million in revenue in its last fiscal year.

Cray’s supercomputing systems can handle massive data sets, converged modeling, simulation, artificial intelligence, and analytics workloads."

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago said they are working on a supercomputer dubbed Aurora with Intel, the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

If the project succeeds, Aurora would represent nearly an order of magnitude leap over existing machines that feature so-called petaflop performance, capable of doing 1 quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations a second.

It also heightens the stakes in a race in which the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

One of Aurora’s primary functions would be simulating nuclear blasts, a pillar of weapons development since the ban of live detonation testings.

Aurora will be built with artificial intelligence capabilities for projects such as developing better battery materials and helping the Veterans Administration prevent suicides, Rick Stevens, an associate lab director with Argonne overseeing the exascale computing project, said during a news briefing.

The project is a win for Intel, which will supply its Xeon CPU chips and Optane memory chips for Aurora.

Intel has been fending off rival U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp’s rise in the chip content of supercomputers as the machines take on more artificial intelligence work. Nvidia’s chips are found in five of the world’s current top-10 supercomputers, though the Nvidia chips are found alongside chips from its rivals, according to TOP500, which ranks the machines.

The world’s current most powerful machine, the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, contains chips from International Business Machines Corp and Nvidia.

The source of chips for supercomputers has become a factor in trade tensions between the United States and China. The world’s third-fastest supercomputer - the Sunway TaihuLight in China - has chips developed domestically in China.

Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner who studies the supercomputing market, said that despite the small contract size relative to Intel’s overall revenue, the work done on Aurora will eventually filter down to the company’s commercial customers.

“It’s not just a jingoistic race between the U.S. and China,” Dekate said. “The innovations that Intel is developing here will percolate down to other parts of its business.”"

The export restriction announcement adding the firms to what is effectively a trade blacklist is the latest effort by the Trump administration to restrict the ability of Chinese firms to gain access to U.S. technology amid an ongoing trade war.

The department said it was adding Sugon, the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology - along with numerous aliases of the five entities - to the list over concerns about military applications of the supercomputers they are developing.

Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology is owned by the 56th Research Institute of the General Staff of China’s People’s Liberation Army, the Commerce Department said, adding “its mission is to support China’s military modernization.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment.

China’s state broadcaster, China Radio International, said in an editorial on Saturday that the move was one of a series of recent actions by the United States that violated the consensus reached by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina last December.

“No matter whether it is aimed at suppressing Chinese technology or its long-term economic development, or put pressure on China in the trade negotiations, the United States will not achieve its aims,” it said.

In 2015, the Commerce Department added China’s National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) to the list “because of its use of U.S.-origin multicores, boards, and (co)processors to power supercomputers believed to support nuclear explosive simulation and military simulation activities.”

The Commerce Department said on Friday that since 2015 NUDT has procured items under the name Hunan Guofang Kei University using four separate, additional addresses not already on the entity list. The department said on Friday it is now adding Hunan Guofang and the four addresses to the list.

The companies “pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,” the Commerce Department said.

In May, the Trump administration added China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to the entity list and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that the United States could resolve complaints about Huawei as part of a trade deal.

The world’s two largest economies have ratcheted up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China’s unfair trade practices.

The United States, China, the European Union and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

In March, a U.S. government-led group said it was working with chipmaker Intel Corp and computermaker Cray Inc to develop and build the country’s fastest computer by 2021 for conducting nuclear weapons and other research.

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois are working on a supercomputer dubbed “Aurora with Intel,” the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

Earlier this week, Nvidia Corp, a major chip supplier to supercomputer makers, said it was working with Softbank Holdings Group owned chip firm Arm Holdings to make its chips work with Arm’s for supercomputers.

Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia’s accelerated computing unit, said that the effort was aimed at European and Japanese customers rather than Chinese groups, which are increasingly turning to domestic chips.

“In terms of China, I think they’ve clearly stated that they have a domestic accelerator and processor strategy that they will pursue, and that’s clearly what they are doing,” Buck said."

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred’s said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

By Uday Sampath Kumar

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Early gains on Wall Street fizzled out by afternoon on Monday as losses in technology and healthcare stocks overshadowed increased expectations of stimulus from central banks around the world.

Microsoft Corp and Amgen Inc were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Amgen fell 3.19% after analysts raised questions about data on the company’s lung cancer drug, dragging the healthcare sector down 0.94%.

Lenders, however, were up on broad gains in U.S. Treasury yields on risings bets of an interest rate cut in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s September meeting.

Financial stocks rose 1.20%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, with banks gaining 2.62%. Technology stocks fell more than 1% and were the biggest drag on the benchmark index.

“The markets are continuing last week’s positive sentiment but with a reduction in pessimism and fear,” said Scott Brown chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Stocks gained last week on easing U.S.-China trade negotiations and global political tensions as well as increased hopes of an interest rate cut.

Cementing those expectations, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said late last week the central bank would “act as appropriate” to sustain economic expansion, a phrase that financial markets have read as a sign of an impending of rate cut.

Earlier on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not see the threat of a recession as the Trump administration seeks to revive trade negotiations with China, adding that he expected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy.

Energy stocks led gains among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors with a 1.41% rise, as oil prices got a boost from the new Saudi energy minister committing to output cuts.

At 13:11 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.95 points, or 0.08%, at 26,818.41, the S&P 500 was down 2.34 points, or 0.08%, at 2,976.37 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 22.49 points, or 0.28%, at 8,080.59.

Among other stocks, AT&T Inc gained 2.61% after shareholder Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and pushed for changes.

Boeing Co fell 0.84% after it suspended load testing of its new widebody 777X aircraft over the weekend as media reports said a cargo door failed in a ground stress test.

Shares of Fred’s Inc plunged 50.82% to a record low after the discount retailer said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.44-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

In recent years, the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and the STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko, Canadian and Kingfisher) basins drew producers and private equity firms willing to wager billions of dollars on what many considered the next Permian basin, the largest and most prolific U.S. oilfield.

(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2R3NhN5)

But while their many layers of oil mimicked the Permian, the region’s geology proved more inconsistent, undercutting results and making it a higher-cost U.S. shale area for producers.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc, which turned a $3.8 billion investment in the oilfield into under $30 million in just two years, last month said it may not be able to pay creditors.

Others are downsizing: Devon Energy Corp, for example, cut capital spending earmarked for its STACK position to 20% of the total in 2019 from 31% in 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on company presentations. The reallocation aims to improve cash flow from the STACK while focusing investment where returns are better, spokesman Tim Hartley said.

Cimarex Energy also forecasts a cut in spending, to 15% in the region in 2019, down from 30% last year, company presentations showed.

“Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year,” Thomas Jorden, chief executive of Cimarex, said in a first-quarter earnings call.

Producers also are narrowing development to areas where wells have produced better results: Marathon Oil Corp and Continental Resources both have anchored recent activity on two sub-areas - the STACK-Meramec and the SCOOP Woodford.

STRUGGLERS

Geology has stymied hopes for a “Permian Jr”: Exploration wells pointed toward uniform rocks that produced high levels of oil, but producers instead encountered more complexity underground, and production weighted toward gas - at a time of a global glut and stubbornly low prices for the commodity.

“The SCOOP/STACK is not a traditional shale play, so when you think about developing it, there are a number of different rock types,” said Denise Yee, vice president at consultancy RS Energy Group. “As it’s so complex, the hydrocarbon mix changes across the play, and the oil window is limited.”

Another disappointment has been poorer results from subsequent wells. Perhaps more than any other U.S. shale basin, the SCOOP/STACK has suffered from a condition known as the “parent/child” well problem, where secondary wells produce less oil than the original.

These problems are reflected in a higher median breakeven price needed to cover costs in the SCOOP and STACK, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

Del Frisco’s, which owns Eagle Steak House and Frisco’s Grille chains, said its shareholders will receive $8 per share, which represents a premium of 18.9% to Friday’s close.

Including debt, the deal is valued at $650 million. As of March 26, the company had $336.1 million in debt.

Del Frisco’s shares were up 17.4% before the bell at $7.90, slightly below Catterton’s offer price.

The restaurant chain in December said it was evaluating options for its business, including a possible sale, amid pressure from activist investor Engaged Capital, the company’s third-largest shareholder with a near 10% stake.

Engaged Capital pushed Del Frisco’s to add a board member, saying the company’s steakhouse restaurants were poorly managed and had rushed into buying two chains to avoid an acquisition.

Del Frisco’s said on Monday Engaged has agreed to vote in favor of the acquisition, which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019.

The company bought two restaurants - Barcelona and bartaco - for $325 million in cash last year, even as traffic declined in its own restaurants.

Upon closing of the deal, L Catterton said it plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona businesses separately from the steakhouse brands.

L Catterton has also invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin’ Brands Inc, Unclue Julio’s Mexican restaurants, P.F. Chang’s and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Piper Jaffray & Co was the financial adviser to Del Frisco’s, while Credit Suisse served as financial adviser to L Catterton."

"Shutterfly, Inc. | SFLY",Reuters,https://news.google.com./articles/CAIiEJS1TcFeGpA2Th-CDAk657IqFggEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMNT5lwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2019-05-13T07:00:00Z,2019-10-07-14-47,Exclusive: Amazon rolls out machines that pack orders and replace jobs,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is rolling out machines to automate a job held by thousands of its workers: boxing up customer orders.

The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years, which scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelops them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters.

Amazon has considered installing two machines at dozens more warehouses, removing at least 24 roles at each one, these people said. These facilities typically employ more than 2,000 people.

That would amount to more than 1,300 cuts across 55 U.S. fulfillment centers for standard-sized inventory. Amazon would expect to recover the costs in under two years, at $1 million per machine plus operational expenses, they said.

The plan, previously unreported, shows how Amazon is pushing to reduce labor and boost profits as automation of the most common warehouse task – picking up an item – is still beyond its reach. The changes are not finalized because vetting technology before a major deployment can take a long time.

Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.

“We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. “We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.”

(Dave Clark is Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations)

Amazon last month downplayed its automation efforts to press visiting its Baltimore fulfillment center, saying a fully robotic future was far off. Its employee base has grown to become one of the largest in the United States, as the company opened new warehouses and raised wages to attract staff in a tight labor market.

A key to its goal of a leaner workforce is attrition, one of the sources said. Rather than lay off workers, the person said, the world’s largest online retailer will one day refrain from refilling packing roles. Those have high turnover because boxing multiple orders per minute over 10 hours is taxing work. At the same time, employees that stay with the company can be trained to take up more technical roles.

The new machines, known as the CartonWrap from Italian firm CMC Srl, pack much faster than humans. They crank out 600 to 700 boxes per hour, or four to five times the rate of a human packer, the sources said. The machines require one person to load customer orders, another to stock cardboard and glue and a technician to fix jams on occasion.

CMC declined to comment.

Though Amazon has announced it intends to speed up shipping across its Prime loyalty program, this latest round of automation is not focused on speed. “It’s truly about efficiency and savings,” one of the people said.

Including other machines known as the “SmartPac,” which the company rolled out recently to mail items in patented envelopes, Amazon’s technology suite will be able to automate a majority of its human packers. Five rows of workers at a facility can turn into two, supplemented by two CMC machines and one SmartPac, the person said.

The company describes this as an effort to “re-purpose” workers, the person said.

It could not be learned where roles might disappear first and what incentives, if any, are tied to those specific jobs.

But the hiring deals that Amazon has with governments are often generous. For the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last year in Alabama, for instance, the state promised the company $48.7 million over 10 years, its department of commerce said.

PICKING CHALLENGE

Amazon is not alone in testing CMC’s packing technology. JD.com Inc and Shutterfly Inc have used the machines as well, the companies said, as has Walmart Inc, according to a person familiar with its pilot.

Walmart started 3.5 years ago and has since installed the machines in several U.S. locations, the person said. The company declined to comment.

Interest in boxing technology sheds light on how the e-commerce behemoths are approaching one of the major problems in the logistics industry today: finding a robotic hand that can grasp diverse items without breaking them.

Amazon employs countless workers at each fulfillment center who do variations of this same task. Some stow inventory, while others pick customer orders and still others grab those orders, placing them in the right size box and taping them up.

Many venture-backed companies and university researchers are racing to automate this work. While advances in artificial intelligence are improving machines’ accuracy, there is still no guarantee that robotic hands can prevent a marmalade jar from slipping and breaking, or switch seamlessly from picking up an eraser to grabbing a vacuum cleaner.

Amazon has tested different vendors’ technology that it may one day use for picking, including from Soft Robotics, a Boston-area startup that drew inspiration from octopus tentacles to make grippers more versatile, one person familiar with Amazon’s experimentation said. Soft Robotics declined to comment on its work with Amazon but said it has handled a wide and ever-changing variety of products for multiple large retailers.

Believing that grasping technology is not ready for prime time, Amazon is automating around that problem when packing customer orders. Humans still place items on a conveyor, but machines then build boxes around them and take care of the sealing and labeling. This saves money not just by reducing labor but by reducing wasted packing materials as well.

These machines are not without flaws. CMC can only produce so many per year. They need a technician on site who can fix problems as they arise, a requirement Amazon would rather do without, the two sources said. The super-hot glue closing the boxes can pile up and halt a machine.

Still other types of automation, like the robotic grocery assembly system of Ocado Group PLC, are the focus of much industry interest.

But the boxing machines are already proving helpful to Amazon. The company has installed them in busy warehouses that are driving distance from Seattle, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Manchester and elsewhere, the people said.

The machines have the potential to automate far more than 24 jobs per facility, one of the sources said. The company is also setting up nearly two dozen more U.S. fulfillment centers for small and non-specialty inventory, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which could be ripe for the machines.

This is just a harbinger of automation to come.

“A ‘lights out’ warehouse is ultimately the goal,” one of the people said."

Here are the key numbers:

Earnings: 45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Revenue: $7.22 billion, vs. $7.26 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

HPE's revenue declined 7% on an annualized basis in the fiscal third quarter, which ended July 31, according to a statement. The company's revenue has now declined year over year for three consecutive quarters.

With respect to guidance, HPE raised full-year guidance to $1.72 to $1.76 in earnings per share, excluding certain items. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting $1.68 in earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the full fiscal year.

The majority of HPE's revenue comes from its Hybrid IT business segment, which includes servers, storage and networking equipment for data centers. The segment produced $5.55 billion in quarterly revenue in the fiscal third quarter, down 9% on an annualized basis and below the $5.70 billion consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. Compute revenue, which represents more than half of Hybrid IT revenue and includes sales of servers, fell 10% on an annualized basis in the quarter.

""While elongated sales cycles persist and remain more pronounced for large enterprise deals there are not materially worse than in June,"" Tarek Robbiati, HPE's chief financial officer, told analysts on a Tuesday conference call. ""HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets. We have also been able to successfully navigate all of the recent tariff increases on China exports that have been factored into our outlook.""

HPE executives disclosed sales execution issues one quarter earlier, with CEO Antonio Neri saying the company had taken steps to improve.

""Fiscal year 2019 was not a year where we wanted to dial up the growth,"" Robbiati said on Tuesday's conference call. ""Fiscal year 2019 is a year where we had to deliver on EPS commitment drive free cash flow. These are the two most important metrics prepare ourselves to dial up the growth in the subsequent quarters.""

In the fiscal third quarter, HPE made a one-time arbitration award to DXC, a company that was formed as HPE's Enterprise Services Business spun out and merged with CSC in 2017. Also in the quarter HPE announced its intent to buy supercomputing company Cray in a deal valued at around $1.3 billion. HPE now expects the deal to close by the end of the 2019 fiscal year, which is earlier than expected.

Shares of HPE are down 2% from the beginning of 2019.

Richards | AFP | Getty Images

Despite the year being more than halfway over, the pace of store closures doesn't appear to be slowing down in the retail industry. More companies piled on the bad news this week. So far, 7,062 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers this year, according to a tracking done by Coresight Research. And the tally could top 12,000 by the end of 2019, setting a new record, Coresight says. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time high of 8,139 closures announced in 2017. With the back-to-school shopping season and winter holidays looming, most retailers planning to shut stores this year have already shuffled through those announcements so they can shift their focus toward the industry's busiest times. But analysts say there are still some exhausted businesses teetering on the brink of survival, as sales continue to shift to the internet and younger brands like Warby Parker, Casper and Allbirds steal shoppers' attention. Take Mattress Firm as one example. The company emerged from bankruptcy back in October. But it's still suffering in an increasingly competitive landscape with newer entrants like Casper and Eight Sleep. And it hasn't been able to achieve all the concessions from landlords that it desired. All the store closure announcements have also been bad news for U.S. mall owners like Simon and Macerich, which were already struggling with traffic to department stores falling off. The landlords are getting creative with their malls, now, bringing in more food options, e-commerce brands and even apartments, hotels and office spaces. The mall model is being reinvented. Amid all the closings, there are still retailers opening stores. Coresight has tracked 3,017 store opening announcements so far this year. This past Thursday, Lululemon opened its biggest store ever in Chicago. And there's a massive, 3-million-square-foot mall called American Dream slated to open in New Jersey on Oct. 25. Below is a running list of some of the most significant retail store closure announcements so far this year.

Fred's

Fred's said Friday it will shutter another 129 stores this year, as the company works to repay its debt and diversify its product selection. It was already planning to close 263 shops in 2019. Now, the discount retailer says it will have roughly 80 retail stores and 166 pharmacies still operating following all the closures. Fred's, which sells groceries and other everyday items like cleaning supplies, has been a victim of e-commerce's ascent in many households. Its shares have tumbled more than 75% this year to trade below $1.

Charming Charlie

Accessories chain Charming Charlie filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week and said with that it plans to close all 261 stores by the end of August. This marks the second time the retailer has filed for bankruptcy in under two years. The company said it hasn't been able to come up with a plan to win shoppers back and ""ensure long-term profitability"" for the business.

Bed Bath & Beyond

Bed Bath & Beyond plans to close at least 40 locations this year — and likely more — while opening 15 stores. The company has said unless it's able to ""negotiate more favorable lease terms with ... landlords,"" the number of closures will grow. Bed Bath & Beyond, which also owns Christmas Tree Shops, lost its CEO Steven Temares in May, with its financial performance weakening and activist investors pushing for change. The company's stock is down about 1% for the year.

Dressbarn

Women's fashion retailer Dressbarn, owned by Ascena Retail Group, is going out of business for good this year. Ascena said it decided to wind down that business entirely in order to be able to turn its focus to its more profitable brands like Ann Taylor and Loft. Just last month, it released a list of the first 28 Dressbarn stores expected to close this year but hasn't announced anything beyond that. All told, about 650 stores across the country will go dark.

Topshop

Fast-fashion chain Topshop is shutting all 11 of its stores in the U.S. The retailer's London-based parent company, Arcadia Group, filed for bankruptcy protection in May, citing ""challenging retail headwinds, changing consumer habits and ever-increasing online competition."" Topshop's U.S. stores are in major markets like New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Miami. The company hasn't yet said when it expects the 11 stores to close.

Party City

Party City plans to shut about 45 stores in the U.S. this year. That's more than normal. The party-supply retailer had been closing 10 to 15 stores, on average, annually. Following the announcement, some speculated a global helium shortage was straining its business of selling balloons for birthday parties, weddings and other special occasions. But the retailer said it was able to secure a new source of helium and that the decision to close more stores in 2019 was unrelated to the global shortage. Party City shares are down more than 28% this year.

Pier 1 Imports

Pier 1 Imports is planning to shut 57 stores in 2019, and potentially more. The home goods retailer in June said if it's ""unable to achieve our performance goals, sales targets and reductions in occupancies and other costs,"" it could shutter as much as 15% of its fleet. Pier 1 closed 30 stores in 2018, leaving it with about 1,000 locations in total across the U.S. Many shoppers have navigated to Amazon and other online retailers to buy things like dishes, wall art and the small furniture accessories that Pier 1 sells. The retailer's shares are up a little more than 1% for the year.

CVS

CVS is closing 46 of its ""underperforming"" locations across the country this year. That's still less than 1% of CVS' roughly 9,600 stores nationwide. But the drugstore chain, like many retailers today, must work toward culling its massive footprint and adding unique services to stores to keep customers coming back. As it shuts some stores, CVS is adding hundreds of SmileDirectClub shops inside certain CVS locations, offering shoppers a cheaper way to straighten their teeth. It's also opening up locations known as HealthHUBS that boast services and products like blood testing and sleep apnea machines. CVS' stock is down nearly 12% in 2019.

Gap

Gap Inc. is planning to shut 230 of its namesake brand's stores over the next two years. This fiscal year, Gap said it expects to close about 50 company-owned stores, net of any new openings or repositionings. The apparel retailer in February announced its plans to split its business into two publicly traded companies, one that includes Gap, Banana Republic, Intermix and its women's and men's athleisure brands Athleta and Hill City, and another with just Old Navy. Gap Inc. shares have fallen more than 27% this year.

Victoria's Secret

L Brands' Victoria's Secret is planning to shut 53 stores this year, as the lingerie retailer struggles to appeal to women with its outdated and over-the-top bras and underwear. On average, the company has been closing roughly 15 stores each year. Meantime, online-based lingerie brands like Adore Me and Lively are opening up stores, potentially making it more difficult for Victoria's Secret to win back market share. L Brands' stock is up about 3% year to date.

Bath & Body Works

L Brands' Bath & Body Works also has some closures planned. The retailer said it intends to shut two dozen locations this year. But it will also be opening 46 stores and renovating more than 170 locations. As Victoria's Secret's sales have been in a slump, Bath & Body Works has been a bright spot for L Brands. The company reported in May that Bath & Body Work's same-store sales surged 13% during the fiscal first quarter. The upbeat news led L Brands to hike its profit outlook for the full year.

Abercrombie & Fitch

Specialty apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. said it plans to close up to 40 stores during fiscal 2019, after closing 29 locations last year. The company has, meanwhile, been working toward reducing the size of its stores and remodeling existing locations. Abercrombie also said it plans to open additional stores this year, to make up for the closures, after opening 22 stores in 2018. It also owns the Hollister clothing brand. The retailer's stock has fallen roughly 10% in 2019.

Charlotte Russe

Teen apparel retailer Charlotte Russe is liquidating and closing all of its stores, after filing for bankruptcy protection in February. At the time, it was only planning to shut 94 stores. But now, the company will be closing more than 500 locations across the country, after a liquidator won the auction for its business in bankruptcy court. Many of its stores are found within shopping malls.

Payless ShoeSource

Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy in February and has started the process of shutting all 2,500 of its stores across North America. Payless struggled with a heavy debt load and also said in court documents it faced ""unanticipated"" delays from its suppliers in recent years that forced it to sell inventory at deep discounts. It's also fallen victim to more consumers shopping for footwear online.

Gymboree

When kids clothing company Gymboree filed for bankruptcy protection in January, it said it would close all 800 of its Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores. It's since sold the rights associated with both Gymboree and its Crazy 8 brand to Children's Place, while Gap has acquired Gymboree's Janie and Jack brand's intellectual property, its website, customer data and other assets.

Family Dollar

Discount chain Dollar Tree said it plans to close 390 Family Dollar stores this year while it renovates 1,000 other locations. After buying Family Dollar in 2015, Dollar Tree has been left with the task of improving the appearance of those stores, many of which are run down. It's also been trying to cut costs. Dollar Tree shares are up more than 24% year to date.

Chico's

Women's clothing retailer Chico's said it will shut between 60 to 80 stores in fiscal 2019. The company overall intends to close at least 250 stores in the U.S. over the next three years. It joins a list of apparel companies that are struggling to stay afloat, as more sales move online and shoppers are lured to fast-fashion brands like Zara. Chico's shares have tumbled more than 38% this year.

Drew Angerer | Getty Images

The store closures just keep coming, from Dressbarn, CVS, Party City, Pier 1 Imports and more. Already, more than 7,150 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers in 2019, according to Coresight Research. And it's not even June. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time record 8,139 closures announced in 2017. Meanwhile, Coresight has tracked 2,726 store opening announcements so far this year.

With the threat of additional tariffs taking effect on consumer-facing goods like apparel and footwear imported from China hanging over retailers, things could get even worse, according to one analyst. UBS' Jay Sole recently said in a note to clients: ""The market is not realizing how much brick & mortar retail is incrementally struggling and how new 25% tariffs could force widespread store closures. ... We think potential 25% tariffs on Chinese imports could accelerate pressure on these [companies'] profit margins to the point where major store closures become a real possibility."" The store closures already announced this year also mean more bad news for U.S. mall owners, which have already been struggling with traffic to department stores, their anchor tenants, largely on the demise. So these mall owners are having to get creative, bringing in more food options, and even apartments and office spaces, to their properties. Here are some of the biggest retailers that have announced store closures so far this year.

Dressbarn, owned by Ascena Retail Group, is going out of business. There's no timeline yet on when Dressbarn's roughly 650 stores across the country are expected to shut. But Ascena said it's beginning to wind down that business entirely, and then will turn its focus to its more profitable brands Ann Taylor and Loft.

Fred's said in April that by the end of this month, it will have shut 159 stores across the U.S., or almost 30% of its fleet of 557 stores nationwide. The discount retailer said at the time, ""most of these stores have near‐term lease expirations and limited remaining lease obligations."" Then, just earlier this month, it said it plans to shutter another 104 Fred's stores by the end of June, bringing the total closures to 263.

Qualcomm, Xilinx, Broadcom –Chipmakers were under pressure led by declines in Qualcomm and Xilinx, which tumbled 6% and 3.6%, respectively. Broadcom also dropped 6%. The drop came after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and effectively halted its ability to buy American-made parts and components. This led Google to suspended business activity with the Chinese telecom giant. Other Huawei suppliers, including Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel and Xilinx, will reportedly stop selling to the Huawei until further notice. U.S. chip suppliers are losing a big customer as Huawei purchases $20 billion of semiconductors each year.

Sprint, T-Mobile — Sprint shares surged 18.8% after the Federal Communications Commission's chairman said he would recommend the company's $26.5 billion merger with T-Mobile. T-Mobile shares also rose 3.9%.

Deutsche Bank — The German bank's U.S.-listed shares slid 2% after UBS downgraded it to sell from neutral. The UBS analyst said Deutsche is a ""levered market play vulnerable to external events and rising rates are currently a distant hope.""

Tesla — Tesla dropped 2.3% after a Wedbush analyst lowered its price target on the electric car maker's stock to $230 from $275. The analyst cited concerns that CEO Elon Musk's expansion into other products is distracting the company from what should be its main goal: gathering core demand for its Model 3.

Apple — Shares of Apple slid 3.1% after HSBC cut the tech company's price target to $174 per share from $180 due to concerns over the looming tariff concerns between the U.S. and China. HSBC believes tariff increases would force Apple to raise prices on its products, which are already seen as expensive. The bank also said there is a risk that Chinese consumers would shift to local brands with comparable products such as Huawei and Xiaomi.

Dish Network — Dish shares slid nearly 6% after announcing it will buy streaming company EchoStar's satellite business for $800 million. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019.

Tata Motors — Shares of Indian automaker Tata Motors climbed 5.7% following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings released before the bell Monday. Tata Motors earned $160.26 million in net profit for the quarter ended on March 31, topping a Refinitiv estimate. The company, however, said it struggled to sell its Jaguar Land Rover in key markets like China.

Delta Air Lines — Delta fell 1.1% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight. Morgan Stanley cited concerns that the airline's free cash flow yield is falling, and the investment bank's updated 2020 estimates which are below the consensus estimates.

Ryanair — Europe's low-cost airline Ryanair fell 2.1% after reporting its weakest annual profit in fours years on Monday. Ryanair cited issues with overcapacity, Brexit and problems with the grounded Boeing 737 MAX for its disappointing quarterly results.

Looking for a new restaurant to try out before its lines get too long? Fishbowl Analytics has got you covered. The firm released its sixth annual list of emerging restaurant brands Tuesday. Past lists have tapped up-and-coming brands like Sweetgreen, which reached a valuation of $1 billion last year, and Shake Shack as chains to watch. The analytics firm rates brands using a combination of nominations, media mentions and social media buzz to curate its list, Fishbowl analyst Katharine Dalton said. To be considered, chains must have five to 75 locations. This year's list is one of its most diverse, representing a range of flavor profiles and restaurant concepts, Dalton said. But one characteristic that most of the chains have in common is their health-focused menus. According to Dalton, that's now the price of entry, not a distinguishing feature.

10. Punch Bowl Social

Millennials are all about experiences, according to marketing professionals. Punch Bowl Social aims to take advantage of that with a mix of dining and entertainment that echos Dave & Buster's. Customers can find corn hole, arcade games, pingpong tables and bowling lanes in its locations. The budding chain also offers a full food and drink menu when players need more sustenance. And if there isn't a location near you yet, there might be soon. The company has plans to add seven restaurants this year to its existing fleet of 16.

9. Bibibop Asian Grill

Bibibop Asian Grill lets you customize your entree from start to finish. The chain takes its inspiration from the Korean rice dish bibimbap. The Columbus, Ohio-based chain, which has 30 locations, is also focused on bringing food to its customers that leaves them feeling happy and healthy. Fishbowl pointed to menu items like bubble tea and cucumber wasabi as fan favorites. Founder Charley Shin is no newcomer to the industry. He's behind Charleys Philly Steaks, which has been around since 1986 and has more than 500 locations.

8. The Little Beet

While its name suggests a beet-focused menu, The Little Beet's menu includes a much wider variety of veggies. Its produce is locally sourced, with a number of vegan friendly choices. The Little Beet also says all of its menu items are both gluten-free and ""guiltin' free."" For now, the fast-casual chain has nine locations in New York and Washington, D.C., but is expanding to Florida in 2019.

7. Lemonade

Founded 11 years ago, Lemonade offers a variety of both lemonade flavors and entrees. Diners move through the restaurant selecting their salads, braised meat dishes and sandwiches cafeteria-style, complete with trays. The California fast-casual chain has 28 locations, but a recent merger with Modern Market Eatery will result in 58 stores in 10 markets between the two of them, with licensing and franchising plans ahead. Lemonade will continue to focus its growth on California, at least initially.

6. Urban Plates

This restaurant is already seeing its lines extend past its doors. Customers love their grass-fed steak and sustainable produce, according to Fishbowl. Like Lemonade, the food here is served cafeteria-style. Urban Plates has locations on both coasts, with 13 eateries in California and 3 in Washington, D.C. The company completed a $38 million fund round in late 2018.

5. Mendocino Farms

Mendocino Farms

The California-based sandwich shop is back on the list again this year thanks to its friendly service and varied line-up of salads and sandwiches. According to Dalton, Mendocino Farms is a ""massive fan favorite."" It's also starting to expand outside of its home market in Southern California to Northern California and Texas. The chain has 25 locations and five more are on the way. In 2015, Whole Foods — prior to its acquisition by Amazon — invested in the company.

4. Dig Inn

This fast-casual eatery takes pride in its locally sourced ingredients. Dig Inn also has it owns farm in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. To keep its prices low, the chain tries to minimize waste by using the entire vegetable. When mixed together, those ingredients result in dishes that diners love to recommend. It has taken the chain eight years to reach 26 locations, mostly in New York City and Boston, but it has much bigger expansion goals this year. It could open as many as 15 stores in 2019 alone.

3. True Food Kitchen

Last year's Number 1 emerging restaurant brand, True Food Kitchen is known for its health-focused menu with vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. It slipped two spots this year in a tight race, but reviewers still love its food, which ranges from quinoa burgers to edamame dumplings to chocolate cake. Oprah Winfrey joined the company's board in 2018 after making an undisclosed equity investment, which the chain plans to use to double its store count over the next two years, focusing mostly on the East Coast. True Food Kitchen has 23 locations. ""I think this could be the year that True Food really explodes,"" Dalton said.

2. Bartaco

Bartaco specializes in street food favorites found in Southern California, Mexico and South America. During its fiscal fourth quarter, the brand opened two more locations, bringing its total to 18. Customers ""highly recommend"" the restaurant and say that they definitely plan to return, Fishbowl found. Fishbowl isn't the only one that sees Bartaco's potential. Del Frisco's Restaurant Group last year acquired the chain's parent company, which also owns a more upscale brand called Barcelona, for $325 million in cash. The company said that it plans to add three to four locations in 2019.

As a result, the stock has gained 6.4% in a month, outperforming the industry 's 3.7% growth. However, the company's dismal top-line performances over the past three quarters have been concerning. Let's delve deeper.

Factors Driving Growth

Marriott continues to impress investors with its solid bottom-line performance. In third-quarter 2018, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.70 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 and increased 62% year over year. Notably, Marriott's earnings have topped the consensus mark for the 17 straight quarters. As a result, the company raised its 2018 earnings view. Currently, it anticipates the metric in the band of $6.15-$6.18 per share, up from $5.81-$5.91 estimated earlier. Earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 5.1% upward over the past 30 days.

RevPAR in North America rose 3% in the third quarter. Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, Marriott is well-poised to grow in the near as well as long term. With global travel estimated to witness a CAGR of 7% over the next 10 years and international trips are anticipated to top 1.8 billion by 2030.

Moreover, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Moving ahead, the company plans to significantly expand its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. For 2018, Marriott anticipates 7% net room growth, which is likely to continue building economics, scale, and consumer preference for its brands.

Earlier, Marriott announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company's loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent. Additionally, it will offer members more than what was promised by the prior programs. Notably, the company's total loyalty membership has increased to 120 million.

Starting 2019, Marriott will implement a fresh program services fee structure for owners, which will help the company to manage cost for programs and services.

Concerns

Marriott's lower-than-expected top-line performance over the past three quarters have disappointed investors. The company's revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first, second and third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, total revenues came in at $5.05 billion, which fell short of the consensus mark of $5.37 billion and declined 0.6% from the year-ago quarter figure.

Meanwhile, in the domestic market, the company is facing competition in New York due to a continuous increase in supply of hotels, which is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR in the region. On the whole, although leisure demand remains strong, cautious corporate, group and transient demand raises concern.

Marriott, which shares space with Choice Hotels International, Inc. CHH , has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Key Picks

Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Belmond Ltd. BEL and Peak Resorts, Inc. SKIS , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Belmond and Peak Resorts current-year earnings are expected to grow by 150% and 342.9%, respectively.

The property marks Hyatt's second management agreement with Tamdeen Group, one of the largest privately held conglomerates in Kuwait.

The new property is under renovation and is likely to open in January 2019. It is in close proximity to Kuwait International Airport that will provide easy connectivity to business travelers. Meanwhile, Grand Hyatt Kuwait, the company's first collaboration with the group, will be launched in 2020.

The latest move underscores Hyatt's efforts to expand and strengthen its Regency brand in the Middle East. Meanwhile, shares of Hyatt have declined 1.2% compared with the industry's decline of 17.6% in a year.

Continual Expansion - A Major Growth Driver

Hyatt continues to expand its presence in Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Meanwhile, the company's new brand signings globally have consistently outpaced its openings and this trend is expected to continue. Hyatt registered net room growth of 7.6% on a year-over-year basis in third-quarter 2018, which marked the 14th successive quarter of growth above 6%.

The company's development pipeline grew roughly 6% in the third quarter compared with the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company expects to grow units on a net room basis by roughly 6.5-7%. As of Sep 30, 2018, the company entered into management or franchise contracts for around 340 hotels or 73,000 rooms.

Meanwhile, the recent hotel addition should fortify the Hyatt Regency brand's global presence and boost revenues from EAME/SW Asia Management and Franchising segment. In fact, in the third quarter of 2018, revenues at the segment increased 17% (21.1% in a constant currency) year over year to $21 million.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer-Discretionary sector are Belmond Ltd. BEL , Peak Resorts, Inc. SKIS and DISH Network Corporation DISH . While both Belmond and Peak Resorts carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DISH Network carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Belmond has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 150%.

Peak Resorts has an expected 2019 earnings growth rate of 342.9%.

DISH Network has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 11.8%.

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

It's not the one you think.

CWCCC's main goal is to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector through education and outreach. The coalition is an integral part of a greater national effort by the U.S. Department of Energy's Clean Cities program. CWCCC is one of almost 100 coalitions across the United States who are working together to reduce petroleum consumption on a grassroots level.

Assisted by Brian Trice the Executive Director of CWCCC, ADOMANI Sales Directors Jim O'Connell and Doug Lollar were on hand to help public fleets from across the Willamette Valley and the greater Portland area, gain familiarity with two of ADOMANI's medium-duty electric commercial vehicles: an electric low-cab forward truck with a stake-side body and an electric logistics van. Public fleet invitees included Oregon Department of Transportation, Oregon Department of Agriculture, Oregon Department of Education, Oregon Department of Administrative Services, City of Corvallis, City of Salem, Salem Electric, Portland General Electric and the Port of Portland.

ADOMANI will have commercial zero-emission electric products available for demonstration and sale to public and private fleet managers, utility companies and others in Oregon and Washington over the next few weeks.

(OTCQB:ADOM), a provider of advanced zero-emission and hybrid vehicle drivetrain solutions and purpose-built electric vehicles, presented at the Florida Utility Electric Vehicle Roundtable in Orlando on September 17th, 2019.

The host utility, Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC), and Florida Municipal Electric Association (FMEA) invited Florida's electric utilities to come together for their third Florida Utility Electric Vehicle Roundtable to discuss the current electric vehicle (EV) landscape in Florida, the impact EVs are having and will have on the electric utility industry, what utilities are doing to prepare, and issues, challenges and opportunities the industry is facing. The roundtable was open to all Florida electric utilities - municipal, cooperative and investor-owned and to Sustainability Program Managers, Conservation and Efficiency Managers, Regulatory and Compliance Personnel, Renewables Coordinators, Electrical Engineers, Utility Directors and Managers, Policymakers and EV Coordinators.

Florida's 33 municipal electric utilities, combined, are the third largest electric provider in the state. Florida's public power utilities serve more than 1.4 million customer accounts and are a statewide employment leader with 5,400+ employees.

Doug Lollar of ADOMANI spoke about its zero-emission product offering of electric trucks, vans and neighborhood electric vehicles. Other speakers included Peter King of Duke Energy who spoke about choosing electric vehicle charging station locations, April Groover Combs of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services provided information to those in attendance about the Florida Electric Vehicle Roadmap, and John Paul Fraites of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection reviewed and gave an overview of the Volkswagen Settlement - Mitigation Plan and Timeframe as it pertains to Florida. The Diesel Emissions Mitigation Program (DEMP) uses funding from the Volkswagen Settlement and the EPA's Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) State Grant Program to provide project-specific funding to mitigate mobile sources of emissions. The primary objective of the Diesel Emissions Mitigation Program is to fund projects that reduce mobile source emissions such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and organic hazardous air pollutants.

ADOMANI will have a zero-emission electric cut-a-way commercial van product in Florida for demonstrations to utility companies and other interested parties over the next few weeks.

Second Quarter 2019 Revenue of $7.3 Million, Up 18% Quarter-Over-Quarter



First Half 2019 Revenue of $13.6 Million, Up 40% Year-Over-Year

Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AESE) (or the “Company”), today provided financial results for the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2019 as well as an update on several key business initiatives. As previously announced, the Company was formed on August 9, 2019 as a result of the completion of a business combination among Black Ridge Acquisition Corp., Allied Esports International, Inc., WPT Enterprises, Inc. and other affiliates.

“In the second quarter and through the first half of 2019, we successfully executed on our business plan and are excited about how both Allied Esports and WPT are performing,” said Frank Ng, CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “We are confident in our long-term strategy and look forward to continuing to drive growth and maximize shareholder value.”

Capital Structure and Liquidity

The business combination generated $20.8 million in gross proceeds for the Company. The table below outlines total cash following transaction-related expenses and payments.

(USD, millions) Cash on Balance Sheet1 $ 7.0 Proceeds From Business Combination 20.8 Transaction Expenses and Cash Considerations2 (6.1 ) Total Cash3 $ 21.7

After close of the business combination, the Company’s basic and diluted common shares outstanding totaled 23.1 million shares.

Allied and WPT Financial Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

Revenues: Total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased 17.7% to $7.3 million from $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a $0.3 million increase in In-person revenues primarily generated from the Company’s flagship Esports Arena Las Vegas and gaming truck events, as well as a $0.8 million increase in Multiplatform revenues related to the distribution of WPT content. Total second quarter 2019 revenues derived from WPT grew 5% to $5.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019 while revenues from Allied Esports grew 60% to $2.3 million over the previous quarter. The Allied Esports growth was driven by an increase in revenues generated at the Company’s flagship HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, which opened in March 2018, as well as increased revenue from the company’s gaming truck events.

Costs and expenses: Total costs and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $10.1 million, consistent with the previous quarter. Increases of $1.0 million in multiplatform costs due primarily to increased productions costs and commissions were largely offset by reductions in Interactive expenses and the lack of any additional impairment related to the company’s reduced ownership of Esports Arena Orange County and Esports Arena Oakland.

Loss from operations in the three months ended June 30, 2019 improved to $2.7 million from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net loss improved to $2.8 million from $3.9 million in the previous quarter.

Second quarter adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, improved by 35.5% to $(1.0) million from $(1.6) million in the first quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of the GAAP-basis net loss to EBITDA is provided in the table at the end of this press release.

Operational Update

Strategic Alliances: As previously announced, Simon, a global leader in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, and TV Azteca, a premier sports television network in Mexico, have made equity investments into Allied Esports Entertainment and are launching strategic alliances with the Company.

Simon and Allied Esports will collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the U.S. The in-mall venues will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events. The two companies plan to announce additional details for The Simon Cup, a co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival this fall combining online and in-person play at select mall locations in the New York and Los Angeles markets, with the winners of the regionals moving on to HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas for the final.

TV Azteca and Allied Esports will continue to work together to expand the esports landscape in Mexico through a number of immediate initiatives, including creating a 24-hour digital esports channel dedicated to esports and video gaming for the Mexican market and developing a network of esports talent across Mexico and Latin America. Future considerations also include building a flagship esports venue and additional esports and content facilities in Mexico and developing a localized online esports tournament platform for the market.

(NASDAQ:AESE)?,"A look at the shareholders of Allied Esports Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:AESE) can tell us which group is most powerful. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.'

With a market capitalization of US$96m, Allied Esports Entertainment is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions don't own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about AESE.

View our latest analysis for Allied Esports Entertainment

NasdaqCM:AESE Ownership Summary, August 22nd 2019 More

What Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Allied Esports Entertainment?

We don't tend to see institutional investors holding stock of companies that are very risky, thinly traded, or very small. Though we do sometimes see large companies without institutions on the register, it's not particularly common.

There are multiple explanations for why institutions don't own a stock. The most common is that the company is too small relative to fund under management, so the institition does not bother to look closely at the company. It is also possible that fund managers don't own the stock because they aren't convinced it will perform well. Allied Esports Entertainment might not have the sort of past performance institutions are looking for, or perhaps they simply have not studied the business closely.

NasdaqCM:AESE Income Statement, August 22nd 2019 More

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Allied Esports Entertainment. As far I can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.

Insider Ownership Of Allied Esports Entertainment

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Leading Destination Operator to Purchase $5 Million of Shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. and Collaborate with Allied Esports to Build Esports Venues at Simon Properties

“Simon Cup” Tournaments and Activations with HyperX Esports Truck to Launch at Select Simon Locations This Fall

Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (BRAC), a public acquisition vehicle, today announced that it has entered into a letter agreement for Simon Equity Development, LLC, a wholly-owned and indirect subsidiary of Simon Property Group (SPG), to become a shareholder of Allied Esports, a global esports entertainment company, through an equity investment in Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.

As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame International Holdings Limited, will be acquired, once all applicable shareholder and regulatory consents have been obtained, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. to form Allied Esports Entertainment (the “Business Combination”).

Highlights from the letter agreement include:

Simon acquiring $5 million in shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.;

Simon and Allied Esports creating dedicated esports venues and experiences at select Simon locations throughout the United States; and

Simon and Allied Esports launching a new competition tour called The Simon Cup.

The obligations of the parties to move forward with the transactions contemplated by the letter agreement are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including but not limited to the execution of definitive agreements between the parties documenting the obligations of Simon to purchase the shares of Black Ridge and consummation of the Business Combination.

Simon and Allied Esports will also collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the country. The in-mall arenas will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events.

“We're extremely pleased to collaborate with Black Ridge and Allied Esports, leading innovators in esports and gaming, to bring cutting-edge venues to our iconic properties around the country. This is exactly the type of innovative activation that excites our customers and drives traffic for our centers at Simon. Simon's successful locations are ideally suited to provide these new and exciting community spaces, complementing our other dynamic offerings,” said Mark Silvestri, Simon's Chief Operating Officer for Development.

“The agreement with Simon is a landmark opportunity to bring Allied Esports’ vision for the future of competitive gaming to Simon's world class property network,” said Lyle Berman, Director of Black Ridge. “As we work to close the transaction combining our NASDAQ-listed Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. with Allied Esports and WPT, the significant investment by Simon would be a testament to our unrivaled plans and to the opportunity Simon sees to participate in this growing industry.”

In addition, Allied Esports and Simon will this year launch The Simon Cup, a groundbreaking, co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival combining online and in-person elements into a uniquely integrated content format. The activation includes regional tournament events at select Simon centers in the New York and Los Angeles markets, culminating in a Grand Final at the iconic HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“Simon’s commitment and investment in our growing esports ecosystem will immediately strengthen our foundation for creating live experiences and compelling content for gamers and fans around the world,” said Frank Ng, co-CEO of Ourgame, owner of Allied Esports. “We are thrilled for the opportunity to work closely with the forward-thinking team at Simon to design specialized mall-based esports concepts that we hope will attract new audiences and partners through their network and enhance our global presence.”

Assuming the parties execute a definitive agreement for the transaction, Simon would purchase $5 million of newly issued shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. at a price equal to the price at which Black Ridge shareholders can have their shares converted for a pro rata portion of the Black Ridge trust account upon closing of the Business Combination; however, the dollar amount of newly issued shares will be reduced by the dollar amount Simon spends, at its sole option, purchasing shares of common stock of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Simon has agreed not to seek conversion of any shares it purchases pursuant to this investment at the meeting called to approve the Business Combination. In consideration of the purchase commitment, Black Ridge would issue to Simon on closing of the Business Combination one additional share of Black Ridge common stock for every ten (10) shares that are purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment and a warrant to purchase one (1) share of Black Ridge common stock for every two (2) shares purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment. For additional information on the transaction, see Black Ridge’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed promptly and which can be obtained, without charge, on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website (http://www.sec.gov).

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. Given the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and the Company’s pending Chapter 11 cases, the Company does not plan to appeal the Nasdaq determination to delist the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, trading of the Company’s common stock and warrants will be suspended at the opening of business on September 24, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company expects the common stock and warrants to be traded over-the-counter under the symbol “AMRQ” and “AMRWWQ” and expects to continue filing its annual, quarterly and current reports in accordance with the requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

SEATTLE, Aug. 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced an entirely new, open and extensible software platform to address the growing need for supercomputing across government and private industries. As advanced simulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation create new, data intensive workloads, the need for performance at scale is growing rapidly. Recognizing the challenges presented by the exascale era, Cray’s software fuses supercomputing performance and capability with the modularity, composability and ease-of-use of cloud computing. In a separate press release issued today, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) announced that Cray has been awarded a third U.S. exascale system contract. The system, dubbed “El Capitan,” will be sited at LLNL. Cray now has $1.5 billion in business for Shasta™ supercomputing systems and the new software platform.



“The Shasta software used with the El Capitan system expands traditional supercomputing to support the complex workflows and numerous 3D studies necessary to unlock the full potential of exascale computing,” said Bill Goldstein, lab director at LLNL. “The flexibility and extensibility of El Capitan’s software and hardware environment will enable the NNSA laboratories to explore and develop capabilities that leverage the combination of AI and machine learning with modeling and simulation to accelerate time-to-solution for our national security codes. These technologies could apply equally well to multi-physics codes employed outside of the national security domain.”

Cray has a rich history of developing the most performant, scalable and reliable software in supercomputing. This is validated by the vast majority of global weather centers that rely on Cray to deliver time critical numerical weather forecasts. These weather centers are at the forefront of the convergence of HPC, AI and IoT workloads that operate at immense scale.

Cray’s new software platform improves performance and reliability by including new key capabilities:

Extends traditional HPC batch workflow scheduling for modeling and simulation with new Kubernetes container orchestration to enable converged HPC and AI workflows.

Adds support for multi-tenancy between HPC and AI partitions and sub-partitioning within AI jobs to enable workflow isolation.

Provides highly resilient containerized services with separate compute and management planes to minimize planned and unplanned downtime.

Creates an open supercomputing platform by including standardized and supported APIs for integration, data access and software ecosystem extensibility and interoperability.

Delivers a new and fully integrated telemetry for the system as well as user application level monitoring to quickly correlate and remediate issues.

“As we enter the exascale era, modern applications are creating the need for applying supercomputing capability to a new class of digital transformation problems. What is the domain of a few national laboratories today is fast becoming a necessity for every enterprise,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO, Cray, Inc. “With our new software platform, Cray is delivering a fully featured, extensible software and tools environment that performs like a supercomputer and runs like a cloud. The same Cray technology that powers exascale systems can be delivered in a single, low-cost rack and ready to integrate into any data center environment.”

With this next generation supercomputing software platform, Cray has addressed key requirements:

Application development and portability : Developers can easily compose converged modeling, simulation, analytics and AI workflows using modern microservices and a robust suite of tools and compilers that support a broad spectrum of processors and accelerators. Applications can easily move from laptop to supercomputer for maximum scalability of code with minimal refactoring.

Interoperability: IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols.

IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols. Investment protection: CXOs and business owners benefit from a multi-user and multipurpose platform with support for heterogeneous processor architectures (x86, AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, FPGAs and other accelerators) and the scalability to meet their rapidly growing analytics and AI initiatives.

“Shasta is designed to support extremely heterogeneous workloads not just from science and engineering, but also from the growing contingent of enterprises that acquire supercomputers to outcompete their rivals in the new era of digital transformation and AI,” said Steve Conway, COO and senior vice president of research at Hyperion Research. “Cray Shasta supercomputers aim to move leading enterprises beyond proof-of-concept to production, and to operate on premises or in the cloud. By integrating extremely heterogeneous requirements into the new Shasta system hardware and software, Cray has substantially expanded its addressable market to include enterprise analytics, AI and cloud computing.”

Cray’s new software platform will be available starting Q4 of 2019. For more information, please contact your authorized Cray sales representative or www.cray.com .

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

(CRAY) ?,"How do we determine whether Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) makes for a good investment at the moment? We analyze the sentiment of a select group of the very best investors in the world, who spend immense amounts of time and resources studying companies. They may not always be right (no one is), but data shows that their consensus long positions have historically outperformed the market when we adjust for known risk factors.

Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) shareholders have witnessed an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. Our calculations also showed that CRAY isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in our short portfolio.

(NASDAQ:DVCR) Share Register?","Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!

The big shareholder groups in Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:DVCR) have power over the company. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes 'a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people'. So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

Diversicare Healthcare Services is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$17m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about DVCR.

Check out our latest analysis for Diversicare Healthcare Services

NasdaqCM:DVCR Ownership Summary, June 19th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Diversicare Healthcare Services?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

Diversicare Healthcare Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 26% of the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Diversicare Healthcare Services's historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

NasdaqCM:DVCR Income Statement, June 19th 2019 More

Our data indicates that hedge funds own 6.8% of Diversicare Healthcare Services. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Our information suggests that there isn't any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies include constipation, nausea, headache, and abdominal pain.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment, today released the following summary review of the clinical trials and efficacy findings for Endari®.

""In light of our decision to withdraw our marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine), there is some confusion relating to the previous clinical trials and efficacy findings that led to Endari's approval by the FDA in 2017,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following summary to our shareholders and the SCD community.""

Endari Clinical Trial Results

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

https://www.emmausmedical.com/content/ceoletters/ceo-letter-sep-10-2019-193

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock.

The pro forma combined balance sheets as of March 31, 2019, after giving effect to the conversion, as well as the final terms of the merger agreement and additional information about Emmaus, can be found in the company's July 22, 2019 Form 8-K filing which can be accessed on the Emmaus investor relations website at ir.emmausmedical.com.

Additionally, Emmaus has officially requested a hearing to appeal the previously announced determination of the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to delist the company's common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing, which is scheduled for September 5, 2019. In the event the appeal is unsuccessful, Emmaus common stock is expected to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Market.

""Our recent merger was a great step toward solidifying our balance sheet and providing us with greater access to the capital markets, which can help fund Emmaus' growth strategy as well as potential future acquisitions or other strategic transactions,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We strongly believe that Emmaus is on the right trajectory to achieve its mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies. The merger was one of the catalysts for Emmaus' improved financial position, putting us in a great place to move the company forward.""

Taps SB360 As Exclusive Consultant To Conduct Store Closing Sales In The Last Remaining 81 Fred's Stores,"BOSTON, Sept. 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fred's Inc., a discount value retailer, has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners as their exclusive consultant to conduct Store Closing Sales in all 81 remaining Fred's locations. SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

SB360 Capital Partners, LLC. A Schottenstein Affiliate (PRNewsfoto/SB360 Capital Partners) More

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Fred's Inc said on Monday it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, months after the pharmacy and discount retailer began shuttering hundreds of unprofitable stores in the United States, sending its shares down 44% before the bell.

Since the start of 2017, over 20 U.S. retailers, including Sears Holdings Corp and Toys 'R' Us, have filed for bankruptcy, succumbing to the onslaught of fierce e-commerce competition from Amazon Inc.

Fred's, which has been making losses since 2015, has been trying to turn around its business. In April, it said it would close at least 159 underperforming and unprofitable stores, or nearly 30% of its total outlets.

""Despite our team's best efforts, we were not able to avoid this outcome,"" Chief Executive Officer Joe Anto said.

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred's said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

Shares of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company, which have lost nearly all their value since the company was forced to scrap its bid for 1,200 Rite Aid Corp stores in June 2017, plunged to 15 cents in early trading.

On October 27, 2015, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens jointly announced an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9.00 per share in cash. To convince the investing public that it would receive FTC approval to complete the merger, Walgreens and Rite Aid had entered into an agreement with Fred's to sell 865 Rite Aid Corp stores for $950 million in an all-cash transaction in order to complete the Original Merger (the ""Fred's Asset Purchase Agreement""). On January 30, 2017, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens announced that they had entered into a new merger agreement (the ""Revised Merger""). On June 29, 2017, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc announced that they had terminated the Revised Merger. Following the termination of the Revised Merger, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc terminated the Fred's Asset Purchase Agreement.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Relatives of the late Raymond Sackler hold a 54% stake in Peak Resorts Inc., which operates 17 ski areas including New York’s Hunter Mountain and Mount Snow in Vermont. Vail Resorts Inc. completed its acquisition of Peak on Tuesday, two months after the deal was announced.

The Sacklers own stock and warrants through Delaware-based Cap 1 LLC, which has held a stake since at least 2015, according to regulatory filings. Beneficiaries of the trust that owns Cap 1 include Raymond’s widow Beverly, son Richard and grandson David. They’re among the eight family members accused in state lawsuits of contributing to the nationwide public-health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans from overdoses.

It’s unclear how much profit the Sacklers reaped from the ski resort deal, because some stock purchases may not have been publicly disclosed. Vail is paying $11 a share for Peak Resorts, a 116% premium over its July 22 closing price. That would value the Sackler stake at $114 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg.

Davidson Goldin, a spokesman for portions of the Sackler family, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Purdue Bankruptcy

Heirs of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler gained notoriety over the past several years as the opioid crisis worsened. Their wealth is founded on drug company Purdue Pharma Inc., maker of the painkiller OxyContin.

Purdue filed for bankruptcy this month to settle claims that it pushed sales of the addictive drug. The Chapter 11 filing is designed to short-circuit more than 2,000 lawsuits against Purdue and the Sackler family by the states, cities and counties that have sued to recoup billion of dollars they spent battling opioid addictions and overdoses. Under a settlement proposal, the governments, hospitals and individuals suing Purdue would take ownership from the Sacklers, who have also agreed to pay at least $3 billion and to sell other assets. Such a deal would be expected to raise a total of more than $10 billion.

Opponents argue Purdue’s plan isn’t enough of a reckoning for the Sacklers, who made billions from the over-prescribing of OxyContin by doctors, spurred by the company’s marketing. The family got more than $4 billion from OxyContin sales from 2008 through 2015, court filings show.

The lawsuits describe a web of trusts, holding entities and investment vehicles comprising the Sackler fortune, including Summer Road LLC, a family office run by David A. Sackler that provides investment-management services to Cap 1.

Summer Road has also invested in hedge fund strategies and bought an office building in West Palm Beach, Florida, for $6.8 million, the Palm Beach Post reported last week. It also owned 8% of eye-care product developer Ocular Therapeutix Inc. and about 7% of Correvio Pharma Corp. as of June 30, according to its latest 13-F filing.

Purdue made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin and is widely blamed for fueling a nationwide crisis that has left more than 400,000 people dead from abuse of prescription opioids over the past two decades.

According to the filings obtained by the Post, members of the family are benefitting from the sale of 17 resorts in the Northeast and Midwest. The Sacklers, known for a complex network of business interests, had a stake in the company Peak Resorts Inc., which owned the ski areas, according to the Post.

Some of the winter resorts lie within the Catskills of New York and the vast hills of New Hampshire, Vermont and Pennsylvania -- places known to have battled the wave of opioid addiction.

Peak Resorts Inc. declined to comment on the matter.

The sale, finalized last week, comes just after Purdue filed for bankruptcy in New York following a tentative settlement with many state and local governments suing it over the toll of opioids.

Representatives for Purdue Pharma didn't mmediately respond to request for comment from FOX Business.

The plan calls for turning Purdue into a “public benefit trust” that would continue selling preecription opioids but use its profits for lawsuit settlements. The Sackler family would give up control of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.

The ""framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,” Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue’s board of directors, said in a statement, “and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis.”

Two dozen states have signed on to the settlement plan along with lawyers who represent many of the 2,000-plus local governments suing the company.

But legal battles still lie ahead for Purdue, which did not admit to any wrongdoing. Several states plan to object to the settlement in bankruptcy court and to continue litigation in other courts against members of the Sackler family. They argue the family has funneled a fortune from the firm into shell companies and Swiss bank accounts, and is getting off too easily

A court filing by the New York Attorney General's Office earlier this month contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves.

The Sacklers are simply ""throwing the carcass of this drug company into bankruptcy,” said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, whose state plans to join Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York in pursuing the company.

Since OxyContin was introduced in 1996, addiction and overdoses have surged. In both 2017 and 2018, opioids were involved in more than 47,000 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Associated Press and FOX Business' Ken Martin contributed to this article.

While Wall Street groaned over the struggles of Uber Technologies, Inc., Lyft, Inc., and WeWork parent The We Company in recent months, a cousin of the traditional IPO has flourished, often delivering a healthy exit for private owners and strong aftermarket trading for public shareholders. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are on course to break records in 2019 both in terms of fundraising and target companies acquired. The structure, which allows a sponsor to raise cash in a new listed vehicle and bring a private company public through M&A, has been around since the 1990s but evolved dramatically since. What have been the key features behind successful deals? What elements of the structure are likely to change? And are there limits on the size and variety of deals going forward?

These were some of the questions addressed at SPAC in Action!, IPO Edge’s first SPAC-focused roundtable featuring four leading experts who are all active players in the field. The participants included Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP; Phil Denning, Partner at communications and advisory firm ICR Inc.; Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds; and Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II.

Mr. Smith, who has advised clients on notable deals including WillScot Corporation and Limbach Holdings, stressed that successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. He also believes that the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets and that SPACs that are too large can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. He ultimately believes that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges.

As an institutional investor in recent deals such as at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited and payments company Repay Holdings Corporation, Mr. Greenberg noted that SPACs offer distinct advantages over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg said he was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Story continues

Mr. Heyer brings perspective as both the CEO of two recent SPACs and a veteran business executive with decades of experience. He believes that SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. Mr. Heyer’s latest deal was to bring OneSpaWorld public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target.

Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group, said that SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs.

The complete interviews with each of the four roundtable participants can be found below.





Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP

Successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. Often the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets. And while some SPAC IPOs have approached a billion dollars, huge SPACs can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. That’s according to Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP, which has advised clients in SPAC transactions including New Frontier Corporation, Netfin Acquisition Corp., WillScot Corporation, Target Hospitality, and Limbach Holdings. Mr. Smith also says that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges. The full interview is below.

Elliott M. Smith focuses his practice on corporate and securities law. Elliott advises clients on a wide variety of capital markets transactional matters, including IPOs, follow-on offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities. Elliott has particular experience representing SPACs and their sponsor teams in IPOs and back-end business combinations. Elliott also advises public company clients on corporate governance matters and compliance with the federal securities laws.

IPO Edge: How has the warrant feature on SPACs evolved and where do you see it going?

Mr. Smith: Way back in the 1990s, SPACs issued units consisting of one share and two warrants, one of which was struck in-the-money, meaning the strike price was below the per-unit IPO price. The in-the-money warrant functioned like an immediate capital raise following the closing of a business combination, but created a lot of dilution to stockholders which put pressure on the stock price. In the 2000s, SPAC IPO units evolved to typically include one in-the-money warrant. Towards the end of that cycle, around 2008, SPACs starting issuing units with one share and one warrant which was struck out-of-the-money.

These days, SPACs issue units in their IPO for $10.00, and the units include a share and a warrant (or a fraction of warrant). The warrants have an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Some repeat sponsor teams or sponsors affiliated with well-known private equity funds are able to leverage their deal-making track record in order to reduce the number of warrants issued as part of the units to one-half or even one-third of a warrant. By reducing the warrant coverage (i.e., the number of shares issuable upon exercise of all the warrants), these sponsors can market their SPACs as more attractive vehicles to target companies and investors as compared to other SPACs that have more warrants outstanding, since the former represent less potential dilution to stockholders upon completion of the business combination.

The warrants are a necessary sweetener in order to bring investors into a SPAC’s IPO, but can be unattractive to potential investors in the stock later on after a business combination because of the overhang. Over the years SPACs have tried to mitigate this by eliminating or ‘cleaning up’ the warrants at the time of the business combination or shortly thereafter, usually through amendments to the warrant agreement that effectively convert the warrants into cash and/or shares. In terms of the future, warrants will likely always be part of a SPAC’s IPO units in one form or another, and I don’t see SPAC units including less than one-third of a warrant anytime soon.

IPO Edge: How do you convince investors to take fewer warrants with their IPO shares?

Mr. Smith: It’s really a function of investors’ regard for the quality of the sponsor team and their track record and the investors’ perception of their ability to find a good target business and complete a business combination. Top-tier sponsor teams that generate a lot of investor interest in their IPOs can offer less favorable terms (i.e., less warrants). First-time sponsor teams rarely can get away with including less than a full warrant in their SPAC units. And when the market slows down, even repeat sponsors will sweeten their IPOs with additional warrant coverage in order to get the IPO sold.

IPO Edge: What are the key ingredients in getting a SPAC IPO to work?

Mr. Smith: Frankly, in recent years we’ve seen a lot of first-time sponsor teams able to complete IPOs, which makes it look like it’s not too difficult to raise a SPAC if the sponsors are willing to provide favorable terms to IPO investors, such as overfunding the trust account or providing significant warrant coverage.

That said, we have seen some IPOs downsize or get pulled due to investor skepticism of teams that come in to SPACs who have not been involved in public deals or growth equity transactions before, like distressed asset investors, or even successful executives who want to do a SPAC because they like the look of the potential returns but don’t have much of a track record for deal making. The SPAC product is really best suited to growth equity stories where the right combination of a savvy sponsor and a solid target business generate investor interest. Distressed assets and value transactions have generally not fared so well with SPACs.

IPO Edge: Some SPACs have recently raised several hundred million dollars in their IPOs. Can they keep growing? What are the remaining issues?

Mr. Smith: In the past few years the size of SPAC IPOs has increased, in some instances to nearly a billion dollars. But oddly enough there are challenges with big SPACs. Generally, in order to mitigate the dilution from the founder shares and warrants, a target business should be 3-4x the value of the SPAC’s trust account. Finding a target business with valuation of $2+ billion can be challenging for SPACs. Companies that size often don’t need some of the things a SPAC offers and can just go do a traditional IPO if desired. So the pool of target companies can be smaller for big SPACs and we’ve had some sponsor teams ask whether it’s possible to reduce a SPAC’s size after the IPO, which is not really possible. As a result, depending on the industry in which a SPAC is focused, we see repeat sponsors opting to raise SPACs in the $200-$400 million range for maximum flexibility to look for a target 3-4x its size, or sometimes larger. If needed, SPACs can scale up for larger deals by raising additional capital at the time of the business combination.

IPO Edge: What kind of advantages do combinations with SPACs have over traditional IPOs?

Mr. Smith: It can be faster, easier, and often cheaper to go public through a SPAC than a traditional IPO. The traditional IPO process typically takes 9-18 months. A SPAC business combination can get done in four months.

With SPACs, there’s greater flexibility regarding deal structuring, marketing materials and communications with investors. Target sellers can take more cash off the table than is otherwise possible in a traditional IPO. SPAC marketing materials can include projections, which is rare for IPOs. There is also flexibility on timing. In an IPO, if the market is not there, the deal often will need to be pulled and the company is back to square one. With SPACs, the transaction terms can be re-cut to be more favorable to investors, additional capital can be brought in through a PIPE or debt financing if needed, and these changes can be made in real time during the marketing process right up until the closing. In an IPO, those kinds of changes would need to be pushed through a Form S-1 and would likely delay the SEC review process, so that’s another advantage for SPACs.

One potential downside of all that flexibility with SPACs is that sponsors and targets can get deals done even if the transaction is not well received by the market. That can lead to real challenges for the post-closing company. If too many public investors redeem at the time of the business combination, the stock will be thinly traded which can make it hard to raise additional capital. It can be challenging for post-SPAC companies to attract institutions to invest in the secondary market if there is low trading volume in the company’s stock.

Another thing to remember is that with a traditional IPO, the Company is typically selling a minority stake in the company to the public, so the potential to be oversubscribed can be higher. In a traditional IPO, the offering size can be calibrated to investor demand and the underwriters can ensure there is healthy aftermarket trading in the stock. With a SPAC, particularly the large ones, sponsors have to turn over all the outstanding stock of the SPAC, which can soak up all the demand in the market make for choppy trading following the closing.

IPO Edge: What about limitations on SPACs and can they be improved?

Mr. Smith: The product itself is inherently flexible to accommodate all types of transactions. It’s really about the sponsor team and the kind of target business that they bring to the market. If a SPAC doesn’t bring a good target business to its shareholders, then it doesn’t matter what the warrant coverage is or if the founders are giving up some of their founder shares, public stockholders will redeem their shares and the stock price is going to suffer. On the other hand, we’ve seen SPACs that have a full warrant do a deal that is well received and they are able to withstand the overhang issue and create value for investors post-closing. So it’s really a function of the quality of the transaction, as well as the target management team’s ability to execute on its growth plan.

That said, there are headwinds for SPACs. One is perception. People continue to view SPACs as high risk. Unfortunately, there are several examples of deals that have gone south after closing, or people remember 2008 when several SPACs liquidated with no deal. Unfortunately, with each business combination that gets done and the stock price tanks, it’s a ding on the SPAC product, which isn’t really right but it’s about the perception.

Some think that SPACs have a tendency to overpay when time is running out for them and they need to find a deal. There’s probably some truth to that, but again, if a sponsor team and target company’s sellers understand the product and the process and are focused on positioning the company to perform post-closing, then I think those negative factors can be overcome.

Lastly, we’ve heard some sponsors lament that their banks don’t ‘show up’ for them to market the business combination with the same energy compared to a traditional IPO. That may be because of how the deferred underwriting fee gets allocated within the bank, and so there probably is room for improvement there that would help back-end deals get executed successfully.





Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds

SPACs can offer distinct advantages to institutional investors over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. That’s according to Cliff Greenberg, SVP and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds, which has invested in a number of recent SPAC companies including at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld (ticker: OSW) and payments company Repay Holdings (ticker: RPAY). Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Cliff Greenberg is the Portfolio Manager of Baron Small Cap Fund. He invests in small-sized U.S. companies with significant growth potential. Investments include fallen angels with strong long-term franchises that have disappointed investors, and special situations where lack of investor awareness creates opportunities. Mr. Greenberg has 35 years of investing experience, including 22 years at Baron Funds.

IPO Edge: Your fund was instrumental in the process of Repay going public through a SPAC, with Baron Funds participating in a private placement that helped extinguish 75% of the warrants in the deal. How did you view that situation?

Mr. Greenberg: Repay had enough money to close the deal, but we advised them to take a little more to immediately buy the warrants. The warrants were dilutive and added confusion to the capital structure. We also preferred that they run with a little less leverage and have more capital to pursue accretive acquisitions.

IPO Edge: SPACs have been raising larger and larger amounts of money. What’s your view on investing in a SPAC at the time of IPO?

Mr. Greenberg: I don’t like to invest in blind pools. I invest in companies, so my approach is to wait until the SPAC identifies a target and then decide.

Sometimes, I’ll put more money in if they need it like I did with Repay. In other cases, I’ll just go out and buy SPAC shares in the market as we did with Clarivate.

IPO Edge: What do you like about SPACs compared with IPOs?

Mr. Greenberg: I can get size with a SPAC. In a regular IPO, I may get $5 million or $10 million in the allocation. But then the stock may jump, and I won’t want to buy any more since it’s too expensive. You’re often not able to establish a full position at a reasonable price.

A big advantage with a SPAC is that I can invest more capital upfront at what I believe is a reasonable price.

Another advantage is there is more disclosure and more time to do due diligence. You can learn more about a SPAC’s acquisition target, see projections, and communicate with management. I take advantage of the ability to meet these companies and get to know them well before investing.

IPO Edge: What’s contributed to the success of SPACs over time?

Mr. Greenberg: There has been an evolution. These used to be $20, $50, $100 million raises. They were acquiring flaky companies and there was a big risk that the deal wouldn’t get approved. Also excess compensation was going to sponsors who didn’t play a role in the acquired companies.

Now, you have $300, $400, $500 million raised. The sponsors are playing a very significant role in the future of the company and are more reasonably compensated for their role.

IPO Edge: Getting back to the Repay deal, what role do you think warrants will play going forward?

Mr. Greenberg: Warrants complicate financial structures and are dilutive. There used to be two warrants issued per share, then one. You’ve had deals done with less than one warrant and there are some in the market now with a quarter of a warrant, which is a favorable development for new long-term investors.

Investors aren’t demanding as many goodies upfront as they were in the past. Institutional buyers don’t need as much incentive.

It’s a positive that Repay was able to retire a good portion of the warrants that were issued upon approval of the deal. I believe this will be emulated going forward and is a major positive.

Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II

SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. That’s according to Steven Heyer, a veteran business executive who brought OneSpaWorld Holdings (ticker: OSW) public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean, has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target. The full interview is below.

Steven Heyer is Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II. He is also lead director of OneSpaWorld Holdings and serves as a director of Lazard Ltd and Lazard Group. Mr. Heyer has over 40 years of experience in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries leading a range of companies and brands. He has applied his leadership and analytical skills in a variety of leadership positions across diverse industry groups, including broadcast media, consumer products, along with hotel and leisure companies. Mr. Heyer was the Chief Executive Officer of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and President and Chief Operating Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. He also was President and Chief Operating Officer of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., and a member of AOL Time Warner’s Operating Committee. Among other roles, he is an advisor and director to, and investor in, several private companies, including startups and turnarounds.

IPO Edge: What type of leadership qualities are most important in a successful SPAC?

Mr. Heyer: The most successful SPACs should have a mix of an operator who can see the potential in a business and someone with the financial mind needed to craft a deal. I really enjoyed working with Andy on Haymaker and we’re doing the same thing with Haymaker II. I’ve come to love him even more.

IPO Edge: What kind of company makes a good SPAC target?

Mr. Heyer: You look for a good business that has both growth and free cash flow. It should be differentiated from the rest of the market with a wide moat around the business. OneSpaWorld has all of those features and we were able to get a deal done with a fabulous company. We had almost no redemptions and great enthusiasm for the transaction.

IPO Edge: What are the reasons to do a SPAC versus a traditional IPO?

Mr. Heyer: If the owner wants to take significant money off the table immediately, a SPAC is better. It’s also an opportunity for the owner to roll some of the investment to participate in the upside of a well-performing stock.

However, for a SPAC to succeed, you need trust and motivation on both sides. That’s how we got a friendly, fast negotiation with OneSpaWorld.

IPO Edge: Is there a size limitation for SPAC IPOs? What’s helping them get bigger?

Mr. Heyer: We raised $400 million for Haymaker II but it could be a billion dollars. The issue is that you’re probably looking for a middle market deal, so you don’t need that much in the SPAC IPO. You’re not going to raise $5 billion.

With a more successful track record, you can attract investors who want to bet on your team before the target is known.

IPO Edge: How have SPACs been perceived over the years?

Mr. Heyer: If you go back 20 years, SPAC was a dirty word. The reason is that people were using them to line their pockets. They were being bad stewards. Even recently, we had a handful of investors who had a knee-jerk negative reaction to a SPAC because of that history. But with more successful deals, attitudes are changing. It’s evolved from being a niche vehicle to becoming a real asset class.

IPO Edge: You talked about cash flow. Could a SPAC deal be done with a fast-growing company that’s not yet profitable?

Mr. Heyer: I would do it if the growth story were compelling enough and the potential for meaningful profit creation was clear. The expectation needs to be that the business can float on its own and doesn’t hinge on a dozen promises or flawless integration. At some point it stretches credibility.

Phil Denning, Partner, ICR Inc.

SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. That’s according to Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay Holdings (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs. The full interview is below:

IPO Edge: What has been the main driver of the success of SPACs in the last several months?

Mr. Denning: One key feature of many successful deals has been the presence of a well-regarded private equity firm that has elected to keep a significant stake in the company after it goes public. It not only sends the message that the private equity firm believes in the business, but can be helpful as the company plots its strategy moving forward. We saw that with both OneSpaWorld, which has L Catterton as a shareholder and Repay, which has Corsair Capital as a shareholder. The role of the private equity firm is generally to advise in the form of one or more board directors. But you can also go with informal advisory roles or even more formal – such as an executive position created.

There has also been an element of creativity in recent deals that made them succeed. The Repay deal would have closed without the PIPE investors, but their additional capital made the terms even better because of the dilution that was eliminated. I think that the flexible nature of the product has fostered creative thinking, which has led to success.

IPO Edge: Warrant “coverage” has decreased in many recent deals – with some as low as ¼ per share. Do you believe that the warrant feature is likely to keep shrinking or do some deals need them?

Mr. Denning: The warrant can be a great incentive to get investors into a SPAC IPO, especially with a team that has a lot of potential but not a proven track record. There are investors out there who really just buy into a deal to get the warrant and have no intention of keeping the shares, and that’s fine – because it helps get the cash raised. But the idea is to attract investors who believe enough in a management team that they want to stick with the SPAC shares and wind up owning the target company.

You will probably always need some warrant feature to keep investors incentivized. After all, if you’re going to let your cash sit in a trust account and just earn minimal interest, you need a carrot.

There will be deals with very small fractions of a warrant. Those are going to be the SPACs whose leadership have very strong track records. For those newer to the game, a full warrant per share is probably going to remain the norm.

IPO Edge: Do you expect SPACs to get even larger in the next few years?

Mr. Denning: I actually think that SPACs under a billion dollars are the ideal size. If you get much bigger the company is probably best suited to go the typical IPO route.

The reason why SPACs may do so well at the current size is that there’s plethora of middle-market target companies owned by private equity. Many of those private equity firms are in a difficult position because the companies aren’t an ideal fit for an IPO, meaning they can only rally be sold to a strategic or another private equity firm. So SPACs have created an entirely new exit path.

And SPACs are more appealing than a straight sale because many private equity owners want to participate in further upside. If you sell the company to another firm, you obviously can’t do that.

IPO Edge: What are the key advantages to going public via a SPAC rather than a traditional IPO?

Mr. Denning: One major advantage I have observed relates to disclosure. With a SPAC, it’s relatively easy to communicate a target company’s growth plans once the deal is announced. You’re able to show the investment community specific targets for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda that you can’t with a traditional IPO. That takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for potential investors.

Another advantage from the perspective of a company owner is the ability to sell a large stake but also remain a significant holder. With an IPO, you’re really only selling a sliver of the company at the time of the deal.

SPACs can also happen much more quickly. If you raise money and find a target right away, a deal can be done in a matter of months. The IPO process is much more long and arduous.

IPO Edge: Are there specific industries that are best suited for SPACs?

Mr. Denning: There has been a lot of success with consumer and consumer-related deals, looking back to Hostess Brands and more recently to OneSpaWorld. But I think there is plenty of scope to grow in different industries. Just recently we had a real-estate SPAC deal announced with Broadmark, which is merging with Trinity Merger Corp. (ticker: TMCX). I would expect sponsors to get more creative as we see successful deals done in new industries.

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.'

With a market capitalization of US$635m, Repay Holdings is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about RPAY.

NasdaqCM:RPAY Ownership Summary, August 9th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Repay Holdings?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that Repay Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold 23% of the stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Repay Holdings's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

NasdaqCM:RPAY Income Statement, August 9th 2019 More

It would appear that 3.7% of Repay Holdings shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Repay Holdings

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

(“Chart”) (GTLS) announced a strategic investment in Stabilis Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLNG) (“Stabilis”) of up to $7 million for up to 9% of common equity. The transaction is scheduled to close within the next thirty days subject to both parties meeting certain closing conditions. The actual investment and ownership will be determined by an agreed upon formula at closing.

Small-scale LNG is a key aspect of the global LNG infrastructure buildout, as these smaller liquefaction plants serve specific uses such as marine bunkering, fuel for over the road transport, gas-LDC peak storage and power generation. Stabilis and Chart together built a 100,000 LNG gallon per day liquefier in Texas, with the intended purpose to service multiple end markets, including energy, industrial, mining, and Mexican exports. Chart supplied the liquefaction train, storage, gas pre-treatment, and truck loading facilities, which contributed to the record production levels of the plant.

“We are pleased to announce this strategic investment in Stabilis Energy,” said Jill Evanko, Chief Executive Officer of Chart. “We look forward to providing equipment and process to Stabilis and other customers as they expand in the small-scale and utility-scale LNG market. We expect over $650 million of opportunity in this market for our products in the next three years.”

“Stabilis welcomes Chart Industries as a shareholder,” commented James Reddinger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stabilis. “As a global market leader in LNG production equipment and process systems, we appreciate Chart’s confidence in us. This transaction better positions Stabilis to pursue our North American small-scale LNG growth strategy, which is currently focused on plant development opportunities in the United States and Mexico.”

Reddinger continued, “Chart’s investment will increase our publicly traded float and total shares outstanding, thereby helping Stabilis meet its NASDAQ listing requirements. Furthermore, the investment will reduce our financial leverage and give us a stronger balance sheet to support our growth plans.”

Stabilis completed a share exchange transaction with American Electric Technologies, Inc. on July 26, 2019 and subsequently commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “SLNG” on July 29, 2019.

Chart Industries and Stabilis Energy will hold a joint conference call at 1:30pm eastern time tomorrow, August 6, 2019. Participants may join the call by using the toll-free dial-in number of 877-312-9395, or internationally 970-315-0456. The conference ID is 1987854.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

Its current pipeline mainly consists of 3 drug candidates; Xynomic owns global exclusive development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to each of these. Its lead drug candidate, abexinostat, is in global potentially pivotal clinical trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (in combination with pazopanib) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (as a single agent).

Xynomic’s pre-clinical oncology drug candidate XP-102 (BI 882370) is a pan-RAF inhibitor.

So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

Does Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 69% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Do The Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?

The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings. Nice! Along with insider transactions, I recommend checking if Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is growing revenue. This free chart of historic revenue and earnings should make that easy.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (NASDAQ:YRIV).

What Is Insider Selling?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

See our latest analysis for Yangtze River Port and Logistics

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Yangtze River Port and Logistics

Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Director, James Coleman, for US$402k worth of shares, at about US$1.14 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$0.89. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. The only individual insider seller over the last year was James Coleman.

James Coleman divested 513k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$1.05. The chart below shows insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Does Yangtze River Port and Logistics Boast High Insider Ownership?

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Yangtze River Port and Logistics insiders own about US$104m worth of shares (which is 68% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Yangtze River Port and Logistics Insiders?

An insider hasn't bought Yangtze River Port and Logistics stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP (“Scott+Scott”), an international securities and consumer rights litigation firm, is investigating whether certain directors and officers of Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (“Yangtze” or the “Company”) (YRIV) breached their fiduciary duties to Yangtze and its shareholders. If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may contact attorney Joe Pettigrew for additional information: 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

Scott+Scott is investigating whether members of Yangtze’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts, about Yangtze’s business, operations, prospects, and financial health. Specifically, Scott+Scott is investigating whether the Board failed to disclose material information, including whether: (1) Yangtze’s purported lease of Wuhan Newport, the Company’s main asset, was a fabrication; (2) Yangtze’s only operating subsidiary, Wuhan Newport, was declared insolvent in China due to a number of default judgments against it; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

On August 27, 2018, Barron’s published, “A Troubled Chinese Company Is Seeking a Lifeline From U.S. Investors,” revealing that Wuhan Newport was “showing up on official websites in which Chinese courts list debtors with unpaid legal judgments.” On this news, Yangtze stock fell $0.11 per share, or almost 1%, to close at $11.53 on August 27, 2018.

On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report, entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated,” which caused Yangtze stock to fall $3.34 per share – over 28% – over the next two trading days to close at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

What You Can Do

If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may have legal claims against Yangtze’s directors and officers. If you wish to discuss this investigation, or have questions about this notice or your legal rights, please contact attorney Joe Pettigrew toll-free at 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

LD Micro has always held the belief that our industry needs a truly accurate indicator of what is occurring in the micro-cap world.

With this reconstitution the index will contain 984 companies, a surprisingly similar number to what we had back in February. Nearly as many companies have “graduated” out of the index as those that have “graduated” in.

Performance since the close of January 31st, 2019:

Nasdaq: +12% (Very nice)

S&P500: +10.2% (Solid)

Dow Jones: +7.5% (Respectable)

Russell 2000: +5% (Better than CDs)

LD Micro Index: -2.8% (The night is still young)

A breakdown by exchange, sector, and complete constituent list is available at our website: http://www.ldmicro.com/the-index.

Chris Lahiji, President of LD Micro, stated ""As we turn four, more people in our industry are using the Index as an additional indicator for what is taking place on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Our goal has always been to add much needed insight to the space, and based on the dichotomy between micro, small, and large-cap, we feel our index provides the most accurate picture of micro-cap as a whole. As evidenced, micro-cap performance thus far in 2019 has been incredibly disconcerting.”

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. Given the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and the Company’s pending Chapter 11 cases, the Company does not plan to appeal the Nasdaq determination to delist the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, trading of the Company’s common stock and warrants will be suspended at the opening of business on September 24, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company expects the common stock and warrants to be traded over-the-counter under the symbol “AMRQ” and “AMRWWQ” and expects to continue filing its annual, quarterly and current reports in accordance with the requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

The notification also stated that the Company would be provided 180 calendar days, or until February 11, 2020, to regain compliance with the foregoing listing requirement. To do so, the bid price of the Company's common stock must close at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to that date.

If the Company does not regain compliance by the compliance deadline, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to remedy the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq staff will inform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the Nasdaq staff that the Company will not be able to remedy the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, the staff will provide notice that its securities will be subject to delisting. The Company cannot provide any assurance that its common shares will trade at levels necessary to regain and maintain compliance with the above-referenced bid price rule before the compliance deadline. The Company intends to continue to monitor the bid price for its common stock. If the Company's common shares do not trade at a level that is likely to regain compliance with the Nasdaq requirements, the Company's Board of Directors will consider alternative options that may be available to achieve compliance.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced in a recent Form 6-K report that on September 4, 2019, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company stating that The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market.



The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting. Additionally, as of the date of this release, the Company continues to make progress with the completion of its delinquent annual report and intends to file these reports with the SEC. The Company intends to complete and file its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as soon as possible with the SEC. Thereafter, the Company intends to work with a market maker to file a Form 211 with FINRA to enable the Company’s shares to begin trading on the over-the-counter markets.

“While there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to execute its plan. If the shares resume trading on the over-the-counter markets, the shares may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on Nasdaq. While trading on the over-the-counter-markets the Company expects to apply for a Nasdaq listing at a future time.” concluded Mr. Liu.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced that a special committee comprised of independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”) has concluded the fact-finding portion of an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Song Wang (“Mr. Wang”), and allegations of enterprise bribery involving the Company that date back to 2014.



The Special Committee retained the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP to assist in conducting this investigation. While the Special Committee identified potential concerns relating to certain Company transactions that may indicate that improper payments were made in connection with the 2014 transaction at issue, it did not identify direct evidence indicating that Mr. Wang or any member of Company Management or the Board of Directors (the “Board”) engaged in or approved of any improper payment. It should be noted that the Special Committee’s investigation was constrained to some extent by the passage of time, significant turnover in Company personnel since 2014 and the lack of direct access to Mr. Wang. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Committee did identify weaknesses in the Company’s compliance program and recommended several improvements, including the addition of resources for compliance and internal audit functions and enhanced training. The Board has approved the adoption of all of these recommendations and the Company has begun implementing them.

The Board also accepted the resignation of two senior managers (including one who was also a director of the Company), who did not notify the Board of the arrest of Mr. Wang until May 16, 2019. It is the understanding of the Special Committee that during the absence of Mr. Wang, from around January 16, 2019 until May 16, 2019, the Company’s operations were managed by other members of the Company’s management team, including a member thereof who exercised certain management authority under power of attorney granted by Mr. Wang prior to his detention.

To enhance its commitment to stringent corporate governance standards, the Board was recently reconstituted by appointing three new directors. The reconstituted Board consists of two independent directors and two executive directors. The Chairman of the Board and all members of the audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance committees are independent. In addition, the management of the Company is currently led by Mr. Bin Liu, the acting chief executive officer, who was appointed to replace Mr. Wang on May 17, 2019. The Company intends to add a third independent director to the Board in the near term to ensure that there are three independent directors on the audit committee and that a majority of the directors on the Board are independent, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules.

L Catterton Enters Into Definitive Agreement to Sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille to Landry's, Inc.

IRVING, Texas and GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Del Frisco's"") and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced the completion of the transaction under which L Catterton has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Del Frisco's for approximately $650 million. As a result of the transaction's close, Del Frisco's stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In conjunction with closing, L Catterton has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille assets to Landry's, Inc. (""Landry's"") for an undisclosed consideration. The transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""We are confident that the separation of the business and the sale of the steak concepts to Landry's creates the best opportunity to unlock value in all of the Company's restaurant brands,"" said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. ""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Mr. Taub added, ""We look forward to leveraging L Catterton's deep restaurant experience and operational capabilities to help bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar reach their full potential. We are confident that running as separate businesses, these highly experiential and unique restaurant concepts will be best positioned for growth and expansion.""

bartaco

bartaco combines fresh, upscale street food with a coastal vibe in a relaxed environment. With 22 restaurants in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, bartaco is recognized as a local neighborhood favorite for outdoor dining, date night, and the best tacos and margaritas by both national and regional outlets.

Today, Barcelona Wine Bar has 17 locations in Colorado, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., each with its own vibrant energy.

Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille

Landry's, which operates more than 500 high-end and casual dining establishments around the world, including well-known steak concepts Morton's The Steakhouse, Mastro's Restaurants and Strip House, is well-positioned to own the Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille restaurants and maintain their leadership position in the industry.

L Catterton was advised by Credit Suisse, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

IRVING, Texas, June 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions. Engaged Capital and certain of its affiliates, collectively holding nearly 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, have entered into voting agreements committing them to, among other things and subject to its terms, vote in favor of adopting the acquisition agreement.

“Over the course of our review, the Committee evaluated a full range of strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives to best serve the interests of our stockholders. After a thorough process, including considering Del Frisco’s current operations and future prospects, the Committee and the Board is confident that this transaction offers the most promising opportunity to realize the highest value for our stockholders,” said Joe Reece, Committee Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“In consultation with our outside advisors, the Board has been evaluating several strategic and financial alternative options since December 2018. This transaction offers immediate liquidity at a significant premium for our stockholders while providing the best path forward for our Del Frisco’s brands, our employees, and loyal guests,” said Ian R. Carter, Board Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“L Catterton brings a distinguished track record of fostering the growth and success of world class experiential brands. Together with their deep operational expertise in the restaurant industry, I am confident L Catterton will be a great long-term partner,” said Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

Del Frisco’s comprises four leading brands across two distinct business lines -- Del Frisco’s Grille and Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in the steak and grill category, and bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar in the upscale regionally-inspired cuisine category. Upon the close of the transaction, L Catterton plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar businesses separately from the steakhouse brands in order to nurture the unique attributes of the brands.

“At L Catterton, we bring more than just capital – we bring significant operational expertise to our investments,” said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. “Over the last 30 years, L Catterton has invested in nearly 30 restaurant concepts globally to create a number of industry leaders. Del Frisco’s has four outstanding brands in two distinct and attractive categories – upscale regionally-inspired cuisine, and steak and grill. We’re excited to partner with the Company to harness the power of these brands by operating the upscale regionally-inspired brands separately from the steak and grill concepts.”

L Catterton has invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin' Brands Inc. (including Outback Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill), CÉ LA VI, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Crystal Jade, Culinary Concepts by Jean-Georges, P.F.

The billionaire owner of casinos, restaurants and the NBA’s Houston Rockets had coveted Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group Inc. since 2012. This summer it looked improbable that his Landry’s Inc. restaurant group would get a shot. Private equity firm L Catterton had struck a deal to acquire the high-end chain in June and, as recently as Tuesday, bankers were busy trying to sell debt to fund the transaction.

But, in a surprise twist, Fertitta popped up to snare the coveted steakhouses.

L Catterton completed its $650 million purchase Wednesday, but immediately announced it was selling Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouses and Del Frisco’s Grilles to Landry’s for an undisclosed sum. The buyout firm will keep bartaco, a purveyor of tacos and tequila, and Barcelona Wine Bar brands.

“It’s something that I’ve looked at for years and sometimes you just have to wait for the deal to come back to you,” Fertitta, 62, said in a phone interview.

Del Frisco’s operates more than 35 restaurants, including Del Frisco’s Double Eagle in Midtown Manhattan, a favorite with the finance crowd, offering its signature 45-day dry-aged double-bone prime ribeye for $140 and a tasting of three wagyu steaks at $205.

It also has locations in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, and one in Washington that caters to lobbyists and politicians. On the night of the deal, a sign indicated that Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was there.

Despite the chain’s popularity with Wall Street, bankers labored to sell $425 million of debt to fund L Catterton’s buyout. Credit Suisse Group AG offered an all-in yield of 9.6%, people familiar with the matter said this month. But with concerns growing about the effects a potential recession may have on a cyclical business, especially expensive steakhouses and wine bars, some investors remained skeptical.

A spokeswoman for L Catterton declined to comment.

Fertitta, who’s worth $3.9 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, also said he couldn’t comment on why L Catterton sold the assets, but he’s a big believer in steak.

The Houston businessman already owns nine steakhouse chains, including Morton’s and Mastro’s. He even opened a female-focused one with actress Eva Longoria in 2013 that’s now closed. Fertitta said he’s willing to put more equity into the Del Frisco’s business and isn’t concerned about the long-term prospects, including the threat from meat substitutes.

“I’ll do whatever I need to do,” said Fertitta, who’s also the chairman and chief executive officer of Fertitta Entertainment, which operates the Golden Nugget casinos. “Steak’s always gonna be the most popular food in the world.”

Fertitta may see a challenge from meat substitutes as consumers flock to restaurants for plant-based burgers from Beyond Meat Inc. and Impossible Foods Inc. Fertitta said the hype of meatless burgers is overblown and that consumers will return to red meat once they realize the products aren’t as healthy as they’re made out to be.

Still, he’s open to serving the trendy plant-based product “if the customers want them,” he said.

Fertitta, who counts Jefferies Financial Group Inc. head Richard Handler as a close friend, used the bank as Landry’s lead adviser on the deal, along with Deutsche Bank Securities and North Point Advisors.

TORRANCE, Calif., Sept. 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants.

Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies include constipation, nausea, headache, and abdominal pain.

Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation included one case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash.

The safety and efficacy of Endari in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease younger than five years of age has not been established.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment, today released the following summary review of the clinical trials and efficacy findings for Endari®.

""In light of our decision to withdraw our marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine), there is some confusion relating to the previous clinical trials and efficacy findings that led to Endari's approval by the FDA in 2017,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following summary to our shareholders and the SCD community.""

Endari Clinical Trial Results

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

https://www.emmausmedical.com/content/ceoletters/ceo-letter-sep-10-2019-193

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

XLRN announced the discontinuation of a phase II study evaluating its pipeline candidate, ACE-083, in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Although the candidate achieved growth in muscle volume in FSHD patients, it failed to deliver a meaningful functional benefit on top of it.

Data from the study showed that ACE-083 achieved statistically significant increase in mean total muscle volume, the study’s primary endpoint. However, the company announced that the increase in muscle volume failed to translate into improvements in functional tests of statistical significance, representing secondary endpoints. This failure resulted in the company’s decision to discontinue further development of the candidate in FSHD patients.

So far this year, Acceleron stock has gained 2.7% against the industry’s decline of 1.2%.

Meanwhile, the company continues to develop ACE-083 as a treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, another neuromuscular disorder in a phase II study. Top-line data from this study is expected in the first quarter of 2020.

We note that the company had discontinued development of another pipeline candidate, ACE-2494 in April. The candidate was being developed in a phase I study as a potential treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Higher frequency of anti-drug antibodies generation was observed in patients, which was the primary reason behind the discontinuation of its development.

Acceleron is developing its lead pipeline candidate, luspatercept, in collaboration with Celgene CELG for the treatment of chronic anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes, beta-thalassemia and myelofibrosis.

Two regulatory applications seeking approval for the candidate as a treatment for beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes associated anemia are under review with the FDA.

Currently, the company is also developing sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”), a rare disease with high unmet medical need. The FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to sotatercept for PAH earlier this month.

In June, Acceleron completed enrolling patients in the PULSAR study and plans to report top-line data from the same in the first quarter of 2020. Also, the company is currently recruiting subjects in the SPECTRA exploratory study to have a better understanding of sotatercept's potential impact on PAH. Preliminary results from this study are expected in 2020.

The acquisition of Finisar was first announced on November 9, 2018.



Under the terms of the merger agreement, Finisar shareholders will receive on average $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI common stock per 1.0 share of Finisar common stock depending on each shareholder’s election as laid out in the merger agreement. This transaction is fully taxable to Finisar shareholders. The company expects to achieve $150M in run rate synergies over the next three years. The financing for the transaction was $1.9B of cash raised in a combination of Term Loans A and B with a combined interest rate of L+251 and $1.1B of the company’s stock.

The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $22.33 to $23.29 in the past one-month time frame.

The company has seen three negative estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few weeks, suggesting there may be trouble down the road. So, make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.

Finisar currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is negative.

Finisar will demonstrate the latest form factors, laser technology, and test equipment for high-speed connections in hyperscale data centers, 5G wireless networks, and optical test systems. See these demonstrations and more in Finisar's booth 62 at the RDS Venue in Dublin, September 23-25.

400GBASE-SR4.2 QSFP-DD transceivers for high-speed data centers

Finisar and Foxconn Interconnect Technology are showcasing the industry's first interoperability demonstration of 400G SR4.2 QSFP-DD optical transceivers at the Finisar booth. These IEEE-compliant transceivers use eight fibers and an MPO-12 optical connector which provide a low total cost solution for 400G data rate upgrades using the installed base of multimode cabling deployed for 100G SR4 in data centers today. The IEEE P802.3cm task force has made a baseline proposal for 400GBASE-SR4.2 which includes support for up to 70m on OM3 and 100m on OM4 multimode fiber, aligned with the 400G BiDi MSA. This is the second short-reach 400G multimode transceiver announced by Finisar, following the 400G SR8 OSFP module demonstrated at OFC earlier this year.

100G PAM4 VCSEL technology for hyperscale data centers

Finisar is unveiling the industry's first public technology demonstration of a multimode VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) transmitting at 100G data rates using PAM4 modulation. This technology demonstration is a critical milestone towards product developments that can enable 800G short-reach optical modules and active optical cables (AOCs) needed for next-generation hyperscale data centers. Traditionally, multimode transceivers and AOCs that utilize VCSEL technology have offered the lowest cost for short-reach interconnect applications, a trend that is expected to continue with 800G+ products that are based on 100G PAM4 per lane. Attendees will be able to observe the optical performance of the prototype VCSEL’s over multimode fiber using a high-speed scope.

5G Wireless Front-haul Ecosystem featuring Tunable SFP28 transceivers

Finisar is showcasing various optical transceiver modules for 5G wireless front-haul networks. Driven by the anticipation of very large volume deployments, wireless front-haul applications will require cost-efficient high data rate solutions. Such applications in 5G networks are expected to require primarily 25G data rates, and Finisar is already offering several products covering 300m, 2km and 10km reaches. For 10km, Finisar provides both duplex and bidirectional transceiver solutions to help customers with optical fiber constraints. For C-RAN applications, Finisar is demonstrating LAN-WDM and O-band CWDM solutions, which enable more efficient wireless front haul networks with a minimum number of optical fibers.

As part of its 5G product offering, Finisar is also demonstrating full C-band DWDM wavelength tunable SFP28 modules operating at 25Gb/s over 15km of single mode fiber. These transceivers provide significant advantages over fixed wavelength solutions for carriers upgrading their networks to the latest wireless standards. Leveraging DWDM technology allows more efficient use of the limited installed fiber in the front-haul network. Finisar’s market-leading wavelength tunable SFP28 transceivers also provide operational efficiencies and savings over fixed wavelength products. These products will be available with Finisar’s patented Flextune™ wavelength self-tuning functionality.

WaveAnalyzer 1500S High Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer

The WaveAnalyzer™ 1500S demonstrates high speed and high-resolution measurements on optical signals in the L-band of telecommunications, including OSNR and WDM analysis. This instrument has been designed to support developers of next-generation optical systems. In addition, the WaveAnalyzer 200A Portable Optical Spectrum Analyzer will demonstrate spectral measurements in a compact, portable, battery operated platform. This instrument supports trouble shooting in Data Center Interconnects as well as mobile measurements in a lab environment.

Establishing the date of the Election Deadline is not intended, however, to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (“SAMR”).



To make an election, all Finisar stockholders who have not previously made their cash, stock, or mixed consideration elections, or who desire to revoke a prior election and make a new election, must submit their properly completed and signed election forms with respect to their shares, together with all required documents and materials set forth in the election form and the instructions thereto, to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), the exchange agent for the Merger, by the Election Deadline. Finisar stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may be subject to an earlier deadline and should read carefully the instructions from their bank, broker or nominee regarding making elections for their shares. Finisar stockholders with questions should contact AST at (877) 248-6417 or (718) 921-8317.

In accordance with the previously announced merger agreement, Finisar stockholders may elect to receive either $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration”), 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI, no par value (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Election Consideration”), or a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Election Consideration”). Finisar stockholders may also choose to make no election with respect to their shares, and will be deemed to have made no election with respect to their shares if they fail to make an election, revoke a prior election without making a new election, or their election materials are not received in proper form by AST prior to the Election Deadline, in which case such stockholders will receive the Mixed Election Consideration. The Cash Election Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration are subject to automatic proration adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement such that the aggregate merger consideration paid to all Finisar stockholders as a group will consist of approximately 60% cash and 40% II-VI Common Stock (assuming a II-VI Common Stock per share price equal to the closing price as of November 8, 2018), as further described in the merger agreement and the joint proxy statement/prospectus provided to Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders in connection with the special meeting of Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders, each of which was held on March 26, 2019.

Under the terms of the merger agreement for the Merger, the deadline for Finisar stockholders to submit their elections is to be 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the date which the parties to the merger agreement agree is as near as practicable to two business days prior to the closing date of the Merger. The Election Deadline has been chosen by II-VI and Finisar in accordance with the merger agreement in order to provide sufficient notice to enable Finisar stockholders to elect their preferred form of merger consideration, while still enabling the parties to consummate the Merger within two business days following the satisfaction of the various conditions to the Merger. The date selected for the Election Deadline does not, however, in any way guarantee or indicate that the Merger will actually close two business days after the Election Deadline, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or certainty of the closing of the Merger. The date of the Election Deadline also is not intended to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by SAMR, and the parties continue to anticipate that SAMR’s approval of the Merger will be received mid calendar year 2019. It is possible, however, that factors outside the control of the parties could result in SAMR’s approval being received at a different time or not at all. II-VI and Finisar reserve the right to set a revised election deadline.

This compares to earnings of $0.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.55%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering no surprise.

Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.

Gladstone Capital, which belongs to the Zacks Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry industry, posted revenues of $12.52 million for the quarter ended March 2019, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.64%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.09 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Gladstone Capital shares have added about 30.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.5%.

What's Next for Gladstone Capital?

While Gladstone Capital has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gladstone Capital was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.22 on $12.51 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.86 on $49.91 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry is currently in the bottom 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Loan investors expect commitments due on at least 10 deals for $6 billion, while the pipeline is thin for junk-rated issuance. Investment-grade borrowers may sell about $15 billion of bonds.

The syndication of loans and a high-yield bond to finance Apollo Global Management Inc.’s buyout of online retailer Shutterfly are expected to continue this week after failing to sell following investor pushback on price and terms. Commitments on the reworked debt sale were due Friday after banks had to fund the LBO, which closed before the loans and bonds could price after negotiations with investors dragged out.

Loans with commitments this week include technology solutions provider CDW’s $1.45 billion refinancing loan, Guidehouse’s $640 million of debt to help finance its planned acquisition of Navigant Consulting Inc. and Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc.’s $440 million loan. Meanwhile, Merlin Entertainments may launch a jumbo cross-border deal as soon as this week. The buyout loan may include about $592 million in U.S. dollar term loans as well as a U.S. dollar bridge facility.

Borrowers have launched loans worth about $50 billion so far this month, making September the biggest month for new deals in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Several companies including Shutterfly struggled to attract demand last week as investors forced some issuers to hike yields and sweeten terms.

Some junk-rated borrowers may hold off on plans to issue new debt this week to give investors time to digest the recent deluge of new bonds. Supply is favorable for money managers despite issuance remaining light, with net sales currently at negative $3.2 billion year-to-date, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. About $49 billion of bonds have left the junk market as companies got upgraded to investment-grade, which more than offset the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance that added to junk volume, according to the bank.

“More than 72% of this year’s gross issuance has been associated with debt repayment and/or refinancing,” Goldman Sachs credit analysts led by Lofti Karoui wrote in a report last week. “As a result, a portion of the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance likely includes maturities that have been ‘pre-funded’ but have not yet reached their call (or maturity) date, resulting in an artificially inflated net supply figure (until those maturities formally roll off).”

In the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market, dealers are projecting as much as $15 billion in new supply over the five days. A record 127 issuers have taken advantage of the current low interest rates and heightened investor demand to borrow over $154 billion for debt refinancing in September.

“If rates stay here I think supply will be heavy going into the end of the year,” Scott Colyer, chairman and chief executive officer at Advisors Asset Management Inc., said in an interview. “Because the absolute cost of borrowing is so low, companies will think of borrowing and with rates this cheap, M&A and share buyback look pretty good.”

In the distressed world, bondholders will be keeping a close eye on debt payments due Monday, including from Intelsat SA, Mallinckrodt Plc, Iconix Brand Group Inc., Jason Industries Inc. and Ultra Petroleum Corp.

Credit investors will also be watching for potential market volatility that may be sparked by the repurchase agreements market. The Federal Reserve is gearing up for the third quarter, with $100 billion overnight repo operations expected to be repeated Monday.

“Spreads are narrow, there’s plenty of liquidity so at this point in time, the credit markets are just fine, operating as they should,” said Colyer. “As we get closer to the end of the cycle, we have started to move up the credits quality scale.”

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

Marks 20th Anniversary of ePort Debut with “Powering Your Unattended World” Themed Booth; Showcases Cutting-Edge Technologies, Partnerships and New Research

The NAMA Show - Today, USA Technologies (USAT) (“USAT”), a premier digital payment, consumer engagement and logistics service provider for the self-service retail market, marked the 20th anniversary of the debut of the ePort which was first unveiled at NAMA in 1999, bringing one of the first cashless payment platforms to the self-serve retail industry. With an eye toward USAT’s continued leadership in innovation, USAT branded its booth, “Powering Your Unattended World,” and showcased new technologies, partnerships and research throughout the show.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190426005366/en/

“Twenty years ago, we ushered in the era of cashless in the vending market with ePort Connect,” said Stephen P. Herbert, CEO of USA Technologies. “Since then, USAT has been at the helm of industry innovation, a change agent powering cashless adoption industry-wide. Early on, we began to recognize the benefits and opportunities possible through cashless technologies. USAT has since grown to support over 15,000 customers and approximately one million connections. We believe we have one of the largest NFC mobile footprints in the US retail market. We were excited to celebrate this incredible accomplishment at NAMA and look forward to continuing to drive innovation and shape the self-serve retail marketplace for decades to come.”

During the show, USAT’s booth focused on the strength of its enterprise platform for unattended retail through its booth design and messaging: bringing consumer engagement and rewards, the benefits of both top-line revenue opportunities through digital payments and the bottom-line margin opportunities through increased efficiencies, logistics and merchandising.

Seed Markets Expansion: USAT announced that Seed Markets is now fully integrated with some of the industry’s large micro market providers, including 365 Retail Markets, Avanti Markets, Company Kitchen, Three Square Market and Yoke Payments. Through the Seed Markets’ cloud-based and mobile solution, micro market operators can now benefit from one standard set of tools including simplified route management, efficient warehouse pre-picking, a single reporting interface and cash accountability. Seed Markets was also featured in NAMA’s New Product Zone.

Apple Pay Cash Study: In its main booth, USAT highlighted a rewards program promoting Apple Pay Cash where a consumer can receive a discount if they use Apple Pay Cash at a participating ePort location.

Michigan State University Study on Low Performing Machines: While many vending operators prioritize equipping high-volume machines with cashless technology, USAT’s study in partnership with Michigan State University found that low performing machines can offer significant revenue growth as well. Vending operators who added cashless technology to machines with less than $2,000 a year in sales experienced top line sales growth of 110 percent on average over the first 18 months following deployment, and cash sales increased by an average of 97 percent on the low performing machines during that same period. The results were presented on the show floor on Thursday, April 25th during NAMA Learning Lab and the full press release announcing the results can be found here.

Partnerships in Action: In its Partner Pavilion, USAT showcased its technology in real life scenarios such as in workplace break rooms, the airport and more, with various industry partners across the vending, micro-market and office coffee services segments. Participating partners include 365 markets, ShelfX, and Bunn. Starbucks and Avanti Markets are also showcasing USAT’s technology in their booths.

“USA Technologies has been a great partner,” said Karalynn McDermott, Senior Vice President of Market Development at Bunn-O-Matic Corporation. “The support and reliability we receive from USA Technologies, as well as their proven system, allows us to grow and innovate. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the company as the convenience service industry continues to grow.”

“Imperial has been a Seed customer for more than 10 years, and it has completely revolutionized our business,” said Lance Whorton President of Imperial Companies. “Through USAT’s Seed technology, we can now ensure our machines are full, our routes are growing and our products are targeted to the preferences of consumers. This ensures we are bringing a better experience to our clients and consumers while increasing our top line sales which continue to grow year-over-year-over-year.”

The NAMA show ran from April 24-26 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, NV.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), in addition to such initial grace period, the Company could be afforded an additional 180-calendar day compliance period, provided that on the 180th calendar day of the initial grace period, the Company (i) met the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement) and (ii) notified NASDAQ of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency.

Additionally, in a press release issued on May 9, 2019, it was announced that on May 6, 2019 the Company received a letter (the ""Failure to File Notice"") from NASDAQ stating that, because it had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the ""Form 20-F""), it was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Failure to File Notice stated that the Company had until May 20, 2019 to submit to NASDAQ a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In setting the May 20, 2019 deadline for submitting a plan of compliance, the NASDAQ Staff determined to apply more stringent criteria and shorten the normal time period for the Company to submit its plan. The Failure to File Notice stated that if NASDAQ accepted the Company's plan, then NASDAQ could grant the Company up to 180 days from the prescribed due date for filing the Form 20-F to regain compliance.

On May 20, 2019, the Company submitted its plan for compliance for filing the delinquent Form 20-F in which it undertook to file the Form 20-F by July 31, 2019.

On July 10, 2019, the Company received a letter (the ""Delisting Notice"") from NASDAQ advising the Company that its Staff had determined to deny the Company's request for an extension of time to file its Annual Report on Form 20-­F for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to delist the Company's Common Shares for failing to comply with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In addition, the Delisting Notice stated that conflicting public disclosures in the Company's SEC reports had created a lack of clarity regarding the composition of its Board of Directors, as well as its executive management, raising significant concerns regarding the governance of the Company, which the Staff believed constituted a separate and discrete basis for delisting in the exercise of the discretionary authority granted to the Staff by Listing Rule 5101. Listing Rule 5101 states, in part, that NASDAQ ""...has broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities in NASDAQ in order to maintain the quality of and public confidence in its market, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. NASDAQ may use such discretion to deny initial listing, apply additional or more stringent criteria for the initial or continued listing of particular securities, or suspend or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs that makes initial or continued listing of the securities on NASDAQ inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of NASDAQ, even though the securities meet all enumerated criteria for initial or continued listing on NASDAQ.""

The Notice stated that unless the Company requested an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist its Common Shares, trading of the Common Shares will be suspended at the opening of business on July 19, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Company intends to request a hearing with a Hearings Panel at NASDAQ to appeal the delisting determination and to request a stay of the trading suspension pending the outcome of the hearing. In addition, the Company will submit a plan of compliance to regain compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing of the Company's Common Shares with its request for a hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with such requirements.

The Delisting Determination stated that unless the Company requests an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist the Company's ADSs, trading of the ADSs will be suspended at the opening of business on September 17, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on the Nasdaq. After due deliberation, the Company does not intend to appeal the Delisting Determination by requesting a hearing before a hearings panel. After the Company is delisted from the Nasdaq, its ADSs may be traded over-the-counter on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the ""pink sheets"" if one or more market makers seeks and obtains approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to continue quoting in the Company's ADSs. Many over-the-counter stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the Nasdaq, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of the Company's ADSs.

This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a Staff delisting determination.

It has resulted from the fact that the bid price of the Company's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") closed below US$1 per share for the last 30 consecutive business days. The Company has a grace period of 180 calendar days, expiring on December 9, 2019, in which to regain compliance.

This research evaluates key technologies involved in digital transformation including 5G, AI, Big Data Analytics, Blockchain, Cloud and Mobile Edge Computing, Connected and Wearable Devices, Cybersecurity, Digital Twins and Teleoperation, IoT, Robotics, Smart Cities, and Virtual Reality solutions.

These technologies will all be germane to the evolution of many areas important to enterprise and industrial organizations including internal and external processes, products and services, virtualization, OSS/BSS, and more.

The enterprise and industrial sectors are rapidly digitizing their products and services including software-controlled and virtualized infrastructure as well as leveraging next-generation connectivity, signaling, and automated decision-making algorithms. This will have a profound effect on both overall strategic positioning and day to day tactical operations. New technologies and tools being rapidly integrated into production and service systems, which are facilitating the transformation of processes, creating new business opportunities, and enabling an overall smarter workplace for humans and machines alike.



Telecom infrastructure and services providers are also undergoing a massive transformation. For example, the combination of 5G and edge computing will transform wireless carrier operations and facilitate enhanced services, new applications, and completely new business models for mobile network operators. In addition, software-defined control and infrastructure virtualization are poised to transform network and service architecture thanks to improvements in technologies that offer improved performance and lower costs. As the border between cloud computing and network infrastructure continues to blur, so does the demarcation between the network as a whole and those network elements (servers, terminals, etc.) that comprise the network.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms enhance the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The combination of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to dramatically accelerate the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The author sees the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) as transformational for both technologies as AI adds value to IoT through machine learning and decision making and IoT adds value to AI through connectivity and data exchange.



AIoT solutions dramatically accelerating the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective smart city solutions in terms of decision making. 5G provides substantial bandwidth where needed as well as significantly lower latency for next-generation applications and services such as virtual reality controlled teleoperation and other enhanced user interfaces.



We see smart cities providing significant opportunities for technology integration in support of highly customized, yet scalable services. There will be a positive feedback loop created and sustained by leveraging the interdependent capabilities of AI, IoT, and 5G (AIoT5G). For example, AI will work in conjunction with IoT to substantially improve smart city supply chains. Metropolitan area supply chains represent complex systems of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer.



The Industrial IoT (IIoT) market is much more than the sum of its parts, but its parts alone can be daunting, especially considering how emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and modified reality is being rapidly integrated into industrial processes. AI alone is anticipated to dramatically reduce costs and improve processes as well as facilitate completely new products and services that improve production, quality, and the producer-supplier relationship.



This is the most comprehensive research available anywhere that evaluates each of these technologies and assesses their convergence and integration opportunities. The research provides a wide-ranging view into the ecosystem including companies, strategies, and solutions for each technical domain as well as cross-domain implementation and operations. The research provides detailed forecasts by application and service, use case, and industry vertical.

Market leading companies are rapidly integrated big data technologies with IoT infrastructure

The big data market consists of infrastructure providers, data centers, data as a service providers, and other vendors. Solutions for managing unstructured data are evolving beyond systems aligned towards primarily human-generated data (such as social networking, messaging, and browsing habits) towards increasingly greater emphasis upon machine-generated data found across many industry verticals.



For example, manufacturing and healthcare are anticipated to create massive amounts of data that may be rendered useful only through advanced analytics and various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as machine learning and cognitive computing. The long-term prospect for these technologies is that they will become embedded in many different other technologies and provide autonomous decision making on behalf of humans, both directly, and indirectly through many processes, products, and services.



Emerging networks and systems such as IoT and edge computing will generate substantial amounts of unstructured data, which will present both technical challenges and market opportunities for operating companies and their vendors. Emerging big data tools such as open APIs much be implemented to facilitate data capture and processing with the ability to perform localized processing and decision making.



Big data solution provider dynamics are evolving almost as much as the data management technologies themselves. While some companies rely upon proprietary solutions, many leading companies such as Hortonworks and Cloudera offer products and services primarily based on open source Apache Hadoop technology. One important distinction between market leaders is collaboration vs. competition. For example, Cloudera competes with IBM, Microsoft, and others in data science and AI whereas Hortonworks partners with these companies.



In terms of data management and analytics technologies, the big data industry is experiencing profound changes across the entire stack including infrastructure, security, analytics, and the application layer. The data services industry as a whole is shifting from host-based network topologies to cloud-based, data-centric architectures, thereby creating enormous challenges and opportunities for transitioning and securing data systems. In concert with this shift, big data infrastructure will require strategic governance and framework for optimized security.



Advanced analytics provide the ability to make raw data meaningful and useful as information for decision-making purposes. AI enhances the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective decision making, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks.



The ability to capture streaming data, determine valuable attributes, and make decisions in real-time will add an entirely new dimension to service logic. In many cases, the data itself, and actionable information will be the service. However, real-time data is anticipated to become a highly valuable aspect of all solutions as a determinant of user behavior, application effectiveness, and an identifier of new and enhanced mobile/wireless and/or IoT related apps and services.



Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) are perhaps best known as data-intensive immersive technologies that require high bandwidth for operations. One of the least evaluated opportunities is the market opportunities associated with visualizing data and information in AR, VR, and MR environments. Much of this data will be unstructured, requiring big data analytics tools to process, categorize, and display in a meaningful manner. This will allow the end user to visualize and utilize information in ways previously inconceivable.



In addition, leading data management companies are developing tools for improved general data visualization, facilitating improved information interpretation and decision making. Coupled with AI and cognitive computing, the field of advanced data visualization and analytics known as augmented analytics is transforming otherwise useless data into highly valuable and actionable smart data, often enabling dynamic decision making that may positively impact business operations as processes, transactions, and other events occur. Much of this smart data will be monetized in a data as a service approach by enterprise thanks to leading big data service provider solutions.



Additional topics covered in this report include:

Market Analysis and Forecasts: Global and regional assessment of the market size and forecasts for 2019 to 2024

This report also includes analysis and forecasts for streaming data analytics. IoT facilitates vast amounts of fast-moving data from sensors and devices. For many use cases, data flows constantly from the device or sensor to the network and sometimes back to the device. In some cases, these streams of data are simply stored (for potential later use) and in other cases, there is a need for real-time data processing and analytics.

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants. As a result, Emmaus common stock and warrants will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market at the start of trading on Wednesday, September 11, 2019. It is expected that the company's common stock and warrants will be eligible for quotation on the OTC market after that date.

As previously disclosed, on July 19, 2019, Emmaus received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that the company was not compliant with the $5 million minimum stockholders' equity requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).

In its letter to Emmaus, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel recognized that the company is doing important work and expressed its hope that Emmaus securities may again trade on Nasdaq once the company meets Nasdaq's initial listing standards. Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

Recent company highlights include:

Reported sharply improved 2019 second quarter results, with net revenues up 128% year-over-year to $5.9 million from $2.6 million , as the company continues to commercialize its sickle cell disease drug.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications. We will continue to focus on our mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies.""

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

Operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was reduced to $1.2 million, versus $7.2 million last year.

As previously disclosed, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI were converted into shares of EMI common stock and cancelled in the merger in exchange for Emmaus shares, with a resulting increase in stockholders' equity. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock at a current conversion price of $9.52, subject to possible future adjustments.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children are born with sickle cell disease.

Taps SB360 As Exclusive Consultant To Conduct Store Closing Sales In The Last Remaining 81 Fred's Stores,"BOSTON, Sept. 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fred's Inc., a discount value retailer, has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners as their exclusive consultant to conduct Store Closing Sales in all 81 remaining Fred's locations. SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

(NYSE: MTN) today announced it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Peak Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKIS) at a purchase price of $11.00 per share, subject to certain conditions, including regulatory review and Peak Resorts' shareholder approval.

Through the acquisition, Vail Resorts will add 17 U.S. ski areas to its network of world-class resorts. Located near major metropolitan areas, including New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Columbus, St. Louis, Kansas City and Louisville, the resorts include:

Mount Snow in Vermont

in Hunter Mountain in New York

in Attitash Mountain Resort , Wildcat Mountain and Crotched Mountain in New Hampshire

, and in Liberty Mountain Resort , Roundtop Mountain Resort , Whitetail Resort , Jack Frost and Big Boulder in Pennsylvania

, , , and in Alpine Valley , Boston Mills , Brandywine and Mad River Mountain in Ohio

, , and in Hidden Valley and Snow Creek in Missouri

and in Paoli Peaks in Indiana

""We are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to add such a powerful network of ski areas to our Company,"" said Rob Katz, chairman and chief executive officer of Vail Resorts. ""Peak Resorts' ski areas in the Northeast are a perfect complement to our existing resorts and together will provide a very compelling offering to our guests in New York and Boston. With this acquisition, we are also able to make a much stronger connection to guests in critical cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest and build on the success we have already seen with our strategy in Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit. The acquisition fully embodies our philosophy of Epic for Everyone, making skiing and riding more accessible to guests across the U.S. and around the world.""

""The ski areas within the Peak Resorts portfolio exemplify the spirit of our sport as well as our Company's mission to provide an Experience of a Lifetime to guests,"" Katz continued. ""We're thrilled to welcome the resorts and their employees into the Vail Resorts family and invest in their continued success.""

""Vail Resorts has a proven track record of celebrating the unique identity of its resorts, while continually investing in the guest and employee experience. For this reason, we are confident that our resorts and employees will continue to thrive within the Vail Resorts network,"" said Timothy Boyd, president and chief executive officer of Peak Resorts. ""We are very proud of our track record over the last two decades in building the breadth, quality and accessibility of our resorts. We are thrilled that our guests will now have access to some of the world's most renowned resorts.""

When the transaction closes, the 2019-20 Epic Pass, Epic Local Pass and Military Epic Pass will include unlimited and unrestricted access to the 17 Peak Resorts ski areas. Guests with an Epic Day Pass will also be able to access the new ski areas as a part of the total number of days purchased. For the 2019-20 season, Vail Resorts will honor and continue to sell all Peak Resorts pass products, and Peak Resorts' pass holders will have the option to upgrade to an Epic Pass or Epic Local Pass, following closing of the transaction.

Additional Transaction Details

The aggregate purchase price for all Peak Resorts common stock is estimated to be approximately $264 million (calculated on a treasury method basis), which Vail Resorts intends to finance through a combination of cash on hand, its existing revolver facility and an expansion of its existing credit facility. In addition, Vail Resorts will be assuming or refinancing Peak Resorts' outstanding debt.

The acquisition is expected to generate incremental annual EBITDA of approximately $60 million in Vail Resorts' fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, the first fiscal year with the full benefit of the synergies of the acquisition, with additional revenue upside in future years. Synergies are expected to come from additional revenue across the Vail Resorts network of resorts and cost reductions from the elimination of certain duplicative administrative functions and greater efficiencies brought by Vail Resorts' size and scale. Vail Resorts' annual ongoing capital expenditures are expected to increase by $10 million to support the addition of the Peak Resorts ski areas. After closing of the transaction, Vail Resorts plans to invest approximately $15 million over the next two years in one-time capital spending to elevate the guest experience at these resorts.

The transaction was approved by both companies' Boards of Directors, and the Peak Resorts Board of Directors also recommends that Peak Resorts' shareholders approve the transaction.

The transaction is expected to close this fall. The parties expect operations at all Peak Resorts ski areas to continue in the ordinary course of business. Upon closing, Vail Resorts plans to retain the vast majority of each resort's employees.

WeissLaw is investigating whether SKIS' Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the merger agreement. Notably, the Company recently announced record-breaking financial results. It reported revenue of $184.42 million for the year ended April 30, 2019, representing an increase of $52.76 million over the $131.66 million reported in the same period of the previous year. According to SKIS' President and CEO, ""[f]iscal 2019 was a record year for [SKIS] . . . Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%.""

Given these facts, WeissLaw is concentrating its investigation on whether the merger enhances SKIS' shareholder value. Specifically, WeissLaw is concerned whether SKIS' Board conducted a fair process in agreeing to the proposed merger, whether the proposed merger undervalues the Company, and whether all material information related to the proposed merger is fully and fairly disclosed.

(NASDAQ: TBRG) (""Thunder Bridge""), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Thunder Bridge will acquire REPAY and the combined company (the ""Company"") will continue as a publicly-listed company with an implied enterprise value at closing of approximately $653 million, based on current assumptions.

Upon the close of the transaction, the Company intends to change its name to Repay Holdings Corporation and is expected to continue to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market under a new ticker symbol. REPAY's management team, led by John Morris, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Shaler Alias, Co-Founder and President, and Tim Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, will continue to lead the Company. REPAY's existing majority equity holder, Corsair Capital, a leading private equity investor in the financial services industry, is expected to remain the Company's largest stockholder.

REPAY processed approximately $7 billion of payment volume in 2018 across diverse verticals, such as personal loans, automotive loans and receivables management. Management believes these verticals are underserved and accordingly provide significant growth opportunities over the next several years. The Company serves more than 3,000 clients via a proprietary, omni-channel payment platform that reduces complexity for merchants and enhances the consumer experience. In addition to highly-recurring revenue, REPAY has achieved strong Adjusted EBITDA growth over the last three years through market expansion, increased penetration of existing customers, new client wins and strategic acquisitions.

Gary Simanson, President and CEO of Thunder Bridge, said, ""REPAY has achieved impressive growth while also delivering high levels of profitability in an exciting and underpenetrated area of the payments sector. John Morris and his team have developed a technology platform that is well-positioned with over 50 software integration partnerships to service customers with a footprint representing more than 11,000 locations across the country.

Transaction Summary

The transaction reflects an implied enterprise value at closing of $653 million, based on current assumptions. The cash component of the purchase price to be paid to the equity holders of REPAY is expected to be funded by Thunder Bridge's cash in trust and debt financing, for which a commitment has been obtained. The balance of the consideration payable to the existing REPAY equity holders will consist of equity interests of the surviving subsidiary which will be exchangeable into shares of common stock of the Company at the option of such equity holders. Existing REPAY equity holders have the potential to receive an earnout of additional equity interests of the surviving subsidiary if certain stock price targets are met as set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Corsair Capital and the REPAY management team will remain investors by rolling over significant equity into the combined company.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Thunder Bridge will domesticate from a Cayman Islands exempted company to a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge will merge with and into Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC, with Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge. The corporate name of Thunder Bridge will change to Repay Holdings Corporation.

The transactions have been unanimously approved by the boards of both REPAY and Thunder Bridge. Completion of the transactions is subject to approval by the stockholders of Thunder Bridge and certain other conditions. The transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.

Additional information about the business combination will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will contain an investor presentation to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and available at www.sec.gov. In addition, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC.

Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

In addition to factors previously disclosed in Thunder Bridge's reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: inability to meet the closing conditions to the business combination, including the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of Thunder Bridge's shareholders, the inability to consummate the contemplated debt financing, the failure to achieve the minimum amount of cash available following any redemptions by Thunder Bridge shareholders or the failure to meet The Nasdaq Stock Market's listing standards in connection with the consummation of the contemplated transactions; costs related to the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement; a delay or failure to realize the expected benefits from the proposed transaction; risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; changes in the payment processing market in which REPAY competes, including with respect to its competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory changes; changes in the vertical markets that REPAY targets; risks relating to REPAY's relationships within the payment ecosystem; risk that REPAY may not be able to execute its growth strategies, including identifying and executing acquisitions; risks relating to data security; and risk that REPAY may not be able to develop and maintain effective internal controls.

Actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. All information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof in the case of information about Thunder Bridge and REPAY or the date of such information in the case of information from persons other than Thunder Bridge or REPAY, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this communication. Forecasts and estimates regarding REPAY's industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT

For additional information on the proposed transaction, see Thunder Bridge's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed concurrently. In connection with the proposed transaction, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. Before making any voting or investment decision, investors and stockholders of Thunder Bridge are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus, when they become available, and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. The documents filed by Thunder Bridge with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, or by directing a request to Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd., 9912 Georgetown Pike, Suite D203, Great Falls, Virginia 22066, Attention: Secretary, (202) 431-0507

PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION

Thunder Bridge and REPAY and certain of their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in favor of the approval of the business combination. Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed participants in the solicitation of the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in connection with the proposed business combination will be set forth in the registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a proxy statement/prospectus, when it becomes available. Information regarding Thunder Bridge's directors and executive officers are set forth in Thunder Bridge's Registration Statement on Form S-1, including amendments thereto, and other reports which are filed with the SEC. Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REPAY uses certain non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its business, measure its performance and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income prior to interest expense and depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to add back certain non-cash charges and account for non-recurring items, such as other expenses, non-cash gain from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction expenses, share-based compensation charges, and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP but instead considered alongside such measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in the industry may calculate it differently from how REPAY calculates it, reducing its overall usefulness. This communication does not provide a reconciliation of any forward-looking, estimated non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because calculating the components would involve numerous estimates and judgments that are unduly burdensome to prepare and may imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or potentially misleading to investors.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain.

""We feel as a company the best way to fight the short and distort strategy of our accuser is to operate and litigate. Our assets have been acquired and developed with real cash payments; and, the long term investment opportunity for profit leveraging our assets will ring true for our investors. This is a long and calculated battle with these short sellers, and we intend to fight with all of our capabilities using every resource available to us. We have a bright future as a member of the global economy and we look forward to the first steps on a long journey,"" said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

The impetus for the action was a false, misleading and defamatory unsigned article published on December 6, 2018 through one of the Defendants' aliases, ""Hindenburg Research,"" which erroneously accused Yangtze of making fraudulent misrepresentations in its public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") or intentionally omitting material information in those filings, laundering money through sham transactions for the benefit of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and being ensnared in a catastrophic liquidity crisis rendering the Company worthless.

As the Company's Complaint establishes with supporting evidence that was publicly filed with the SEC, the statements made in the Defendants' report are not only demonstrably false and misleading, but also nothing more than a ""short and distort"" attack on the Company for the financial gain of those Defendants, who concede in the Report that they ""are short YRIV"".

In the meantime, the Company has suffered a disastrous fallout from Defendants' coordinated attack, resulting in, among other things, reputational damage per se and monetary damages, which the Company seeks to redress through its lawsuit. The Company is confident that through this lawsuit, it will achieve the necessary legal recourse to compensate it for Defendants' wrongful actions and rehabilitate its reputation, enabling the Company to, once again, develop and continue to grow financially for the benefit of its shareholders.

On YRIV's latest quarterly balance sheet, the rights to the land are reported as having a value of $299 million, comprising over 77% of the company's total assets… Despite claiming to lease 1.2 million square meters from the village, our government-sourced maps…show that the total area of the village is only 610 thousand square meters. Moreover, conversations with officials from the village in question revealed that contrary to the company's claims, YRIV has not leased any land from them.""

The value of $299 million reflected in the Company's latest quarterly balance sheet is not related to the 1.2 million square meters of land. Instead, the reported value of $299 million relates to the value of land use rights of the unused portion of 6 parcels of commercial land (steel logistics park). Originally, the value of these land use rights of the 6 parcels of commercial land totaling 515,600 square meters, was booked at a cost of $308 million , of which 79,200 square meters of land have been used for constructing commercial buildings with 92,700 square meters of floor area, leaving 436,400 square meters of unused land. It is this unused piece of land that we have reported a value of $299 million . As of today, due to the significant appreciation of the local real estate market, we estimate that the 515,600 square meters of land that the Company has obtained land use right certificates for and was accounted at cost value, has nearly doubled to a value of nearly $600 million .

The Company's lease of 1.2 million square meters of land mentioned in the Report comprises land not only from the Chunfeng Village but also Junmin Village and Jiangdi Village, which were brokered and represented through Chunfeng Village.

2. Undisclosed Legal Judgments

A list of the 11 undisclosed legal judgments mentioned in the Report is set forth below:

Items 1-6 relate to the litigation and judgements arising from the sale of commercial house flats by the Company's subsidiary, Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd. (""Wuhan Newport""). These commercial house flats were sold in or before 2015. According to the relevant contracts of sale, if Wuhan Newport fails to develop the area in accordance with its original development plan within one year after the sale and purchase, Wuhan Newport would have to repurchase the commercial house flats at the original contracted price back from the purchasers. These proceedings were instituted by the purchasers before the said properties appreciated and doubled in value between 2017 and 2018. Consequently, the purchasers are now reluctant to enforce the judgments and sell back the properties to Wuhan Newport. The Company has already made provisions for the purchase of the properties in the financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Because the judgments were already rendered, the Company has not disclosed these judgements as ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Item 7 refers to the loan of RMB 290 million due to China Construction Bank Gangcheng Branch dated May 28, 2014 mentioned in the Report, plus interest totaling approximately RMB 325 million , and not in addition to such loan. The loan and interest payable obligations have been disclosed and accounted for in the Company's financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2017 .

The Company is in the process of negotiating a loan restructure with the bank and in the meantime, all payments due are suspended. Also, as a result of negotiations, the bank has not instituted enforcement proceedings. As in the above Items 1-6, because a judgement has already been rendered, the Company has not disclosed it as an ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Items 8-11 refer to judgements obtained against Wuhan Newport as a guarantor for certain loans taken out by a large shareholder of Wuhan Newport before it became a subsidiary of the Company. Since the judgments were rendered, the shareholder has undertaken in writing to be solely responsible for all these loans without recourse to Wuhan Newport and has entered into a repayment plan with his creditor(s). Accordingly, no enforcement actions have been instituted against Wuhan Newport and in accordance with legal opinion from PRC counsel, there are no legal or financial liability accorded to Wuhan Newport.

3. Money from YRIV's Capital Raises Has Been Used to Pay the Chairman/Controlling Shareholder Rather Than Advance Company's Projects

The Report alleges that the Company has consistently reported large liability balances ""due to related parties"" on its financial statements. These, in turn, seem to accrue large interest rates which simply get added to the ""advances"" over time. When capital is raised, cash is then used to pay back the supposed related-party ""advances"", rather than being employed to further the company's projects.

Ever since the closing of the reverse merger in December 2015 , the Company has taken out 19 short-term loans via convertible notes totaling $8.546 million . The money from these loans was mainly used for paying the proposed upfront deposit payments for acquiring another entity, Wuhan Economic Development Port Limited (""Wuhan Port EDP""). Because the acquisition of Wuhan Port EDP as aborted, the Company began repaying the convertible notes from the loan proceeds. As of the end of November 2018 , the Company has repaid $9.031 million ( $7.846 million in principal plus $1.184 million in interest), leaving an unpaid principal of $699,000 .

Contrary to the Report, the Company's CEO, Mr. Xiangyao Liu has not only not received a penny from these loans but has advanced as much as $485,000 towards the payment of the $9.031 million by the Company and will likewise advance the forthcoming redemption of an unexpired principal of $699,000 plus interest.

Hindenburg quoted the following from the Company's Quarter Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 :

The Report concluded that there was a total repayment of ""loans"" of approximately $6.2 million to Mr. Liu. This is not the case. The Report focused on the numbers highlighted in the red circles but neglected the increased amounts highlighted in the green circles which showed increased advances from Mr. Liu to the Company. The net effect of the aforementioned numbers shows a net advance from Mr. Liu to the Company. In addition, as mentioned in the Report, ""the total amount of those 19 convertible notes amounted to $8.5 million, of which $3.39 million is outstanding while $5.15 million has been redeemed."" As such, there is no way that Mr. Liu would have received $6.2 million from the proceeds of the notes.

""The Report contains numerous errors of facts and misleading speculations that are libelous and we categorically deny such speculations. This Report is largely a rehash of prior allegations made against us and only focuses on certain discrete information to cultivate a distorted view of the Company"", said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ""We have not granted access to Hindenburg nor has Hindenberg ever contacted us to seek any clarification or explanation to the allegations made. These speculations have caused significant damage to our Company and we are resolved to take such actions necessary to defend ourselves and protect the interests of our shareholders. Additionally, we have instructed counsel to explore our recourse against Hindenburg for making such irresponsible, baseless and libelous statements, including but not limited to instituting legal proceedings against them. We are committed to a high level of corporate governance and stand by the integrity of our financial statements and business operations. We will be conducting a special internal investigation into the other allegations made and will report the outcome of such investigation in due course.""

Full Year 2018 Financial Results

Interest and fee income

For the year of 2018, total interest and fee income, which include interest and fees on its direct lending loans, management and assessment service fees and interest on deposits with banks, was $0.26 million, compared to $16.53 million for the prior year. The significant decrease in loans issued was caused by a combined effect of business slow-down of the direct lending loans in Xinjiang area as a result of management assessment of economic environment in supply chain financing in Urumqi and increasing past due loan receivable and interest receivable which resulted in reversal of interest income. since the second half of 2017.

Interest expenses

The Company used borrowed funds, including short-term bank loans, secured loan and loans from third parties, to fund its direct lending business. Total interest expenses decreased by $0.47 million, or 6.4%, to $6.90 million for the year of 2018 from $ 7.37 million for the prior year mainly due to interest penalty from overdue loans. The loans with the amount of $154.41 million were overdue.

Provision for loan losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance ASU 2016-13 for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, which is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information and will likely result in earlier recognition of credit reserves.

CECL adoption will have broad impact on the financial statements of financial services firms, which will affect key profitability and solvency measures. Some of the more notable expected changes include:

Higher loan loss reserve levels and related deferred tax assets. While different asset types will be impacted differently, the expectation is that reserve levels will generally increase across the board for all financial firms.

Increased reserve levels may lead to a reduction in capital levels.

As a result of higher reserving levels, the expectation is that CECL will reduce cyclicality in financial firms' results, as higher reserving in ""good times"" will mean that less dramatic reserve increases will be loan related income (which will continue to be recognized on a periodic basis based on the effective interest method) and the related credit losses (which will be recognized up front at origination). This will make periods of loan expansion seem less profitable due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Periods of stable or declining loan levels will look comparatively profitable as the income trickles in for loans, where losses had been previously recognized.

Provision for loan losses increased by $30.42 million, or 55%, to $85.72 million for the year of 2018 from $55.30 million for the prior year. The increase was mainly related to more loans past due over 180 days as compared to that during the year ended December 31, 2017 as certain customers were facing financial difficulties since the second half of 2017 that caused increased provision rate charged for loan losses for the year 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management continued to assess the adequacy of the allowances in a cautious manner. Management assessed the collectability of loan receivable balances on an individual basis and concluded the collection from certain borrowers is remote . The following table summarizes provisions for loan losses.

At the end of each period, we conduct an aging analysis of each customer's arrears to determine whether the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. In establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider historical experience, the economic environment, trends in the construction industry, expected collectability of amounts receivable that are past due, and the expected collectability of overdue receivables. An estimate of doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. As a result, total allowance of $128.93 million was recorded for the year of 2018, compared to $64.29 million for the prior year. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had 75 and 59 business loan customers, and 159 and 174 personal loan customers, respectively. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

Financial Condition and Going Concern

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.31 million, compared to $1.22 million as of December 31, 2017. Net loans receivable was $92.58 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $117.26 million at the end of 2017. Short-term bank loans, loans from a cost method investee, loans from third parties and secured loan were $7.98 million, $14.54 million, $3.31 million and $79.21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to $11.97 million, $15.37 million, $nil and $15.34 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.

Most of our customers are MSMEs and individual proprietors located in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province and Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Our customers are involved in the commerce and service, energy and mining, real estate, agriculture and husbandry, supply chain financing, construction and decoration, manufacturing, consumer credit and other industries. In particular, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, loans to the tire supply chain financing industry accounts for 35.9% and 46.5% of total amounts of loans originated by the Company, loans to commerce and service industry accounts for 24.9% and 39.8% of total amount of loans, and loans to construction and decoration industry accounts for 23.0% and nil of total amount of loans. The capital liquidity of the Company was also influenced consequently due to a decrease in cash inflows provided by operating activities. The company's operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and if the Company will be able to maintain profitability and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and /or manage operating expense in line with revenue forecasts, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability.

The Company's accounts have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern basis. The following includes conditions give rise to substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date and management's plans to mitigate these adverse conditions:

The Company had an accumulated deficit of $136.62 million, negative net asset of $36 million and total liabilities of $122.02 million as of December 31, 2018. Assessing that the Company was not able to keep the size of lending business within one year from the financial statement issuance date, the Company established Zhiyuan and Zeshi in November 2018, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, including business factoring program, financing products design, related corporate financing solutions, investments and asset management, etc. as part of its restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2018, Zhiyuan disbursed loans of aggregating $64.7 million to four customers.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred operating loss of $94.13 million. Affected by the reduction of lending business and increased loans losses, the management was in the opinion that recurring operating losses would be made continue within one year from the financial statement issuance date. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred negative operating cash flow of $2.20 million. However with the establishment of Zhiyuan and Zeshi, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, the management assessed the Company would have a positive operating cash flow within one year from the financial statement issuance date.

The Company has been actively seeking for strategic investors with experience in lending business as well as financial investors. On July 10, 2018, the Company closed a registered direct offering pursuant to a previously announced securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, raising approximately $1.69 million, net of issuance costs, from selling its ordinary shares at a price of $2.60 per share. The Company plans to continue to seek fund resources as well as strategic investors for additional financing.

Though management had plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statements issuance date, as there is no assurance that the liquidity plan will be successfully implemented. Failure to successfully implement the plan will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial position, and will materially adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern.

On January 16, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from Xinjiang superior people's court. China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd. sued the Company and its guarantors for a default on the loan, plus penalties. On September 18, 2018, Xinjiang Superior People's Court adjudicated that the Company shall repay the principal, interest and penalties owed to China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd, aggregating US$16.4 million. The Company is now in the process of appeal and is actively negotiating with China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd about the debt restructuring, but there is no agreement achieved as of the date of the announcement.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company was involved in five lawsuits with its loan customers for the aggregated claim of delinquent balances of $2.95 million, and in which the Company is a defendant. The amount which the Company is being sued for delinquent balances owned to two third parties is approximately $4.64 million.

Recent Updates

In April 2019, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the disposition of Xinjiang Xin Quan Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (""Xin Quan""). As of the date of disposition, Xin Quan was not engaged in any operations, nor had any net assets.

On February 4, 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a framework agreement to acquire up to 80.46% of equity interest in Zhejiang Lixin Enterprise Management Holding Co., Ltd.

Pursuant to such framework agreement, the Company will acquire the equity interest in Lixin from six selling shareholders of Lixin by issuing new shares and/or using cash on hand. The proposed transaction is expected to be consummated through multiple closings with the first closing by June 30, 2019, subject to further review and approval of the Company's Board of Directors and/or shareholders, if needed, as well as other customary closing conditions. There is no guarantee that the transaction contemplated under the framework agreement will be consummated as planned or at all. The Company expects that the acquisition of equity interests in Lixin, if consummated, has the potential of transforming the Company into a profitable and well diversified financial services company with geographical outreach well beyond the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Company also announced that its business factoring services business, which the Company launched in late November through its recently incorporated subsidiary, Zhiyuan Factoring (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd.

On August 6, 2018, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Xin Quan that engages in the business of financial leasing, increased its registered capital from US$30.0 million to US$50.0 million. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company, through China Fenghui Financial Holdings Group, holds a 60% interest in Xin Quan and Xinjiang Heli Kaiyuan Construction Co., Ltd. (""Heli Kaiyuan"") holds a 40% interest in Xin Quan.

On July 6, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two institutional investors for a registered direct placement of approximately $2.0 million gross proceeds from selling its ordinary shares at a price of $2.60 per share. The Company issued a total of 769,232 ordinary shares to institutional investors. As part of the transaction, the Company issued to the investors Series A warrants to purchase up to 576,924 ordinary shares at an exercise price of $2.60 per share, which warrants have a term of four (4) years from the date of issuance. The investors also received Series B warrants with an initial face amount of 200,000 ordinary shares, which are subject to adjustment not in excess of an aggregate of 462,843 ordinary shares for nominal consideration. The transaction was closed on July 10, 2018.

On May 21, 2018, the Company announced the expansion of its service offerings with the launch of its financial leasing services. The financial leasing services will be operated through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Xin Quan and Ningbo Ding Tai Financial Leasing Co.

Both subsidiaries will benefit from a corporate income tax exemption for their initial five years, and half exemption for following five years. There are no business operations of the two subsidiaries as of the date of the announcement.

On May 08, 2018, the Company entered into agreement with Heli Kaiyuan to transfer 33.33% equity shared of Xin Quan, with consideration of $nil. Then, Xin Quan's board of directors passed a resolution to increase the registered capital to $50 million from $30 million. And on the same day, the Company signed shareholding entrustment agreement with Heli Kaiyuan to state that Heli Kaiyuan holds 20% equity interest in Xin Quan on behalf of the Company. As a result, the Company holds 60% equity interest in Xin Quan. On August 06, 2018, the change in registration has been completed.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

(NASDAQ: CCIH) and Encourages ChinaCache Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, Aug. 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of investors that purchased ChinaCache International Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ: CCIH) securities between April 10, 2015 and May 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). Investors have until August 12, 2019 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Click here to participate in the action.

The complaint, filed on June 12, 2019, alleges that on April 29, 2019 ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for fiscal year 2018. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (""Chairman""), Song Wang (""Wang""), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

Further, on May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019, because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the ""NASDAQ Letter""). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache's engagement of its new auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

(the ""Company"" or ""Del Frisco's"") and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced the completion of the transaction under which L Catterton has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Del Frisco's for approximately $650 million. As a result of the transaction's close, Del Frisco's stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In conjunction with closing, L Catterton has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille assets to Landry's, Inc. (""Landry's"") for an undisclosed consideration. The transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""We are confident that the separation of the business and the sale of the steak concepts to Landry's creates the best opportunity to unlock value in all of the Company's restaurant brands,"" said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. ""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Mr. Taub added, ""We look forward to leveraging L Catterton's deep restaurant experience and operational capabilities to help bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar reach their full potential.

WeissLaw is also concerned whether the deal creates shareholder value for DFRG's shareholders. Specifically, WeissLaw is investigating whether DFRG's Board conducted a fair process in agreeing to the proposed merger, whether the proposed merger undervalues the Company, and whether all material information related to the proposed merger is fully and fairly disclosed.

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants. As a result, Emmaus common stock and warrants will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market at the start of trading on Wednesday, September 11, 2019. It is expected that the company's common stock and warrants will be eligible for quotation on the OTC market after that date.

In its letter to Emmaus, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel recognized that the company is doing important work and expressed its hope that Emmaus securities may again trade on Nasdaq once the company meets Nasdaq's initial listing standards. Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications. We will continue to focus on our mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies.""

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

Operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was reduced to $1.2 million, versus $7.2 million last year.

As previously disclosed, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI were converted into shares of EMI common stock and cancelled in the merger in exchange for Emmaus shares, with a resulting increase in stockholders' equity. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock at a current conversion price of $9.52, subject to possible future adjustments.

Recent Highlights



Received clearance on its investigational new drug application from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the study of a new L-glutamine treatment for patients suffering from diverticulosis. EMI commenced a pilot/phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of its treatment at multiple study sites, with patents approved in the United States , the EU, China , Russia , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Australia and Indonesia . Emmaus has patents pending related to diverticulosis treatment in Brazil and India .

Entered into an exclusive agreement with taiba Healthcare for the registration, commercialization and distribution of Endari in certain countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

As previously reported, on July 17, 2019, Emmaus, formerly known as ""MYnd Analytics, Inc.,"" completed its merger transaction with EMI, whereby EMI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emmaus and the business of Emmaus became that of EMI. On July 18, 2019, Emmaus common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMA.""

Since the merger transaction occurred subsequent to the 2019 second quarter, Emmaus' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflects the historical business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and operations and financial results of the former MYnd Analytics which were spun off in conjunction with and prior to the merger. As a result, those results bear no relation to the company's current business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations. EMI's historical financial statements, along with pro forma financial information for Emmaus which give effect to the spin off and the merger, can be found in the exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A to be filed on August 14, 2019 which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.

Nasdaq Listing Status Update

Emmaus is currently reviewing a number of options related to maintaining the listing of its common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

Optical Fiber Market Overview :



Optical fiber refers to the medium and technology that is used to transmit information through a plastic or glass strand from one source to another. The information is transmitted through optical cables as rapid light pulses. The receiving end of a fiber optic transmission translates the light pulses into binary values. An optical fiber offers numerous advantages such as increased bandwidth, decreased size and weight, electromagnetic interference immunity, data security, electrical isolation, and others. These are used in communication applications, which include telecom, utility, community access television (CATV), military, and others and in non-communication applications such as sensor, fiber optic lighting, and others.



Growth in need for fast and improved networking and network services and increase in broadband connections in developing economies are anticipated to be the major drivers of the global optical fiber market. Moreover, rising demand for optical communication and sensing applications for different purposes, pressing demand for optical fiber cable (OFC) in the IT & telecom sector, increasing internet penetration, and surging adoption of fiber to the home (FTTH) connectivity are expected to drive the optical fiber industry growth. However, high installation cost and enhanced adoption of wireless communication systems are expected to impede the market growth.



Conversely, rise in government investments in fiber optic network cable (OFC network) infrastructures are expected to present major opportunities for market expansion during the forecast period. For instance, the Indian government has been investing in OFC network infrastructure to increase use and availability of internet across the country, which is in line with the government's initiatives such as Digital India and Smart Cities Mission.



The global optical fiber market is categorized based on mode, type, industry vertical, and region. Depending on mode, the market is bifurcated into single mode and multi-mode.

PlayTime with KittyPlays, a monthly series that will debut in the spring of 2019, will be a live esports entertainment and variety show, featuring top influencers and celebrity guests; competitive gameplay across a range of titles and genres; fan interaction and participation; and unique commentary on current news and esports issues, all streamed in front of a live studio audience at HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“I’m so excited to take my stream to the live stage and interact with my community in person,” said Michaela. “We are going to have an incredible lineup of guests on the show to talk, play and have some fun, and I can’t wait to share this experience with everyone in the arena and those watching on the live stream.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays will be the first of multiple original content debuts planned for release by Allied Esports this year. As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame Holdings International, will be acquired, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: BRAC), to form Allied Esports Entertainment. Creating premier live experiences, multiplatform content and interactive online services that reach and engage a worldwide audience of players and viewers, is a central part of Allied Esports Entertainment’s mission.

“Partnering with talented and popular streamers like KittyPlays to create fresh, interactive events and content is a key component of our growth strategy,” said Frank Ng, current CEO of Ourgame and expected CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “PlayTime is an outstanding kickoff to a year of what we intend to be a much larger, comprehensive content offering to come from Allied Esports, and we’re confident that Kristen’s magnetic personality and skill will carry this concept far beyond our own lofty expectations.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays, which will be produced by Allied Esports with Michaela serving as co-executive producer, will utilize Allied Esports’ multimillion-dollar broadcast studio and arena in the HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, featuring a two-story LED video wall, two-dozen cameras, wired player comms, and a dedicated control room for game observers called The Observatory, to create an unparalleled live experience and compelling streamed and post-produced content that will be available to viewers following each episode. Allied Esports has produced a number of original productions over the past year, including Ninja Vegas ’18 starring Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, which at the time set a new Twitch record for viewers on an individual stream and garnered 2.4 million unique viewers over the seven-hour event.

Each episode of PlayTime with KittyPlays will feature approximately six hours of original content, including:

Michaela and her guests leading into the live program with a “Just Chatting” pre-show stream on their individual channels starting two hours beforehand;

Topical and personal thought-provoking conversations with esports’ top influencers and celebrity guests energized by live audience member and stream chat participation;

Michaela’s unique perspective on recent events and issues facing today’s gaming communities;

Live, high-level gameplay, including “Squad Fills” and challenges with Michaela’s special guests and lucky audience members chosen at random.

Segments showcasing Michaela teaching pro athletes and celebrity gamers how to improve their craft;

Pre-recorded video shorts highlighting up-and-coming esports stars.

Led by Michaela’s naturally inclusive and positive personality, PlayTime with KittyPlays will also focus on giving a voice to those in the esports space who have gone unrecognized, who hail from diverse backgrounds, and who have overcome adversity to achieve personal bests in gaming and beyond.

Information about live guests, show dates, tickets and viewing platforms will be released in the coming weeks. Fans can follow @KittyPlays, @Allied Esports and @HyperXESALV and visit alliedesports.gg and hyperxesportsarenalasvegas.com for updates and additional news.

Michaela started her career in esports as a Counter-Strike player and began streaming her gameplay on Twitch while attending the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. After seeing success with her broadcasts, Michaela decided to leave school to pursue streaming full time, leading her to the wildly popular game of Fortnite. Since then, Michaela has taken streaming and social media by storm with her focus on positivity, community, and joy in gaming and everyday life. Whether broadcasting games, traveling the world, designing cosplay characters, or simply living a health-conscious life, Michaela’s style and personality play a large part in the creation of her content.

Michaela, who primarily plays Fortnite on her stream, is host to one million-plus followers on Twitch and boasts more than a million monthly viewers between Twitch, YouTube and other social media channels. During E3’s 2018 Celebrity Pro-Am event she paired with actor Chandler Riggs (The Walking Dead) and carried the duo to a third-place finish winning $250,000, with her portion donated to her local charity of choice, Kelowna BC SPCA. Most recently she teamed up with FaZe Clan’s Turner “Tfue” Tenney to compete in Korea’s Fortnite Open. Michaela again dominated the competition and together the pair took home a first-place prize of $1,000,000 to be donated to charity.

What started as a part-time hobby to meet likeminded friends has grown into a career that delivers enthusiasm and positivity to Michaela’s audiences, creating real connections around the world and leaving a lasting positive effect on everyone that watches her. Michaela is the founder of Team Kitty, a Twitch-based networking and mentorship team that enhances Michaela’s vision to create a network of female creators focused on upbeat personalities and high-level viewer interaction. Michaela is currently the Head of New Gaming Initiatives for esports organization Gen.G, with a focus on signing competitive players for its female Fortnite team, as well as sales and building of Gen.G’s newly renamed brand.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today provided an operational and financial update for its subsidiaries Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa Upstream”) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher Midstream”) and announced that Alta Mesa Upstream has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



Operational Update

Alta Mesa Upstream

First quarter 2019 production is estimated to be 37,800 BOE per day (48% oil, 71% liquids). Alta Mesa Upstream entered the year with six rigs actively working and reduced the rig count to zero by the end of January. A new development program was restarted in March by completing 16 drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) and operating two drilling rigs. The Company’s objective with the development program is to improve economic returns through a revised well spacing pattern of four or five wells per section, improved lateral placement and lower well costs. Under the reinvigorated development program, Alta Mesa Upstream has drilled 10 wells completing eight patterns (including the DUCs) and through May 17, 2019 had brought 22 new wells onto production. These wells are all tied into Kingfisher Midstream’s system.

The wells drilled and completed in 2019 have been averaging less than $3.0 million per well compared to $4.5 million per well experienced by the end of the previous drilling program. The Company has also made material progress on reducing lease operating expenses on a unit cost basis and lowering recurring general and administrative costs. More detail will be provided when it reports first quarter 2019 financial results.

Kingfisher Midstream

Kingfisher Midstream’s estimated first quarter volumes are summarized below.

System Gas Volumes 137 MMcf per day

Produced Water Volumes 85,000 Bbl per day

Crude Oil Volumes 6,600 Bbl per day

Proved Reserves

On February 25, 2019, Alta Mesa Upstream provided an initial estimate of 158 MMBoe for December 31, 2018 proved reserves. Based on its April 2019 assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and the uncertainty of funding the related development costs, Alta Mesa Upstream removed a total of 89 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2018, Alta Mesa Upstream had 69 MMBoe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 25 MMBbl of oil, 20 MMBbl of natural gas liquids and 144 Bcf of natural gas. The reserves have a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $813 million. Should Alta Mesa Upstream’s ability to fund the required development costs improve in the future, Alta Mesa Upstream expects to recognize all or a portion of the removed PUD reserves as proved.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update

At May 1, 2019, Alta Mesa Resources had debt with total face value of $1,061 million and $144 million of total liquidity, including $110 million of cash. Alta Mesa Upstream’s total debt was $868 million, comprised of $368 million utilized on its credit facility and $500 million of senior notes. The Company previously disclosed that Alta Mesa Upstream had drawn substantially all remaining capacity under its Credit Facility on April 1, 2019. As of May 1, Alta Mesa Upstream’s liquidity includes $95 million of cash.

Kingfisher Midstream had total borrowings on May 1, 2019 of $193 million within its available credit capacity of $225 million, resulting in liquidity of $47 million comprised of $32 million of available borrowing capacity and $15 million cash on hand. Until the delivery of audited 2018 and unaudited first quarter 2019 financial statements and the related compliance certificates, Kingfisher Midstream is limited to $225 million of borrowing capacity. Once those financials are delivered, the borrowing capacity, subject to continued covenant compliance, will return to $300 million.

The Company continues to make progress in finalizing its Form 10-K as well the first quarter 2019 Forms 10-Q for both Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Upstream but is unable to estimate the date at which these filings will be completed.

NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards

The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified Alta Mesa Resources on May 14, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and because the Company remains delinquent in filing its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Initial Delinquent Filing”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa Resources is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing by June 3, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Initial Delinquent Filing, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing.

Provides Bank Borrowing Update; Retains Financial Advisor; Receives NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards","HOUSTON, April 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today announced that Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“AMH”) had drawn substantially all of the remaining capacity under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of $370 million after the most recent borrowing base determination on April 1, 2019, which decreased the borrowing base by $30 million. The cash held following the draw, approximately $86 million, is intended for general corporate purposes.



James Hackett, the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In this challenging environment, we believe it is important to increase our liquidity to ensure we have adequate financial flexibility. We will continue to explore our options to strengthen our balance sheet, including options to address our indebtedness.”

Alta Mesa has retained Perella Weinberg Partners and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. as its financial advisor to assist with analyzing and considering financial alternatives.

Alta Mesa today also announced that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified the Company on April 2, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Annual Report”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing within 60 calendar days from the date of notification, or by June 1, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Annual Report's filing due date, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

The Annual Report was not filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time period because the Company needs additional time to complete its financial statements and related disclosures. As previously announced, the Company expects to report material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company has taken additional time to ensure the accuracy of its 2018 financial information, to complete the required discussion and analysis of the business and to finalize the conclusions regarding the assessment of internal control. Although the Company is still completing its testing of internal control, it has not identified material misstatements to its previously filed financial information and believes that no restatements to historical periods will be required. While covenant relief was not attained during the borrowing base redetermination, the Company continues to be in discussions with its lenders under the Credit Facility. If unsuccessful in obtaining relief, the Company may be unable to comply with the terms of the Credit Facility during 2019, which would permit the lenders to cease making amounts available under the Credit Facility, to require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and to exercise other rights under the Credit Facility.

Alta Mesa is working to complete the Annual Report and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Alta Mesa also announced today that NASDAQ notified the Company on April 3, 2019 that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the NASDAQ rules for continued listing. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ’s exchange. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 30, 2019, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 30, 2019, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and September 30, 2019 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed compliance period. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notice.

(Nasdaq:CRAY) today released the findings of its industry report on the State of Enterprise AI Adoption 2019 , which reveals that performance, data locality and security are the top considerations for choosing an AI infrastructure. The survey assessed whether organizations and individuals are prepared to run AI effectively and to take advantage of the capabilities it offers. Findings show that over 70% of companies already have AI applications in use or under development, and as the use of AI grows, IT professionals must consider what infrastructure is needed to maximize the value, scale and performance of their AI workloads.



The State of Enterprise AI Adoption 2019 survey was constructed to help identify the state of enterprise AI adoption, evaluate the perception and value of AI in the enterprise and determine the infrastructure being used to execute AI workflows. The report findings, based on responses of more than 300 IT professionals across a broad range of industries, show that many organizations, 39%, are using supercomputers, HPC systems or dedicated AI hardware to run their AI workloads. For these organizations using on-premises systems, over 60% expect to expand their infrastructure to keep pace with increasing storage and performance demands.

“The research highlights that supercomputing plays an important role in enabling mainstream AI adoption in the enterprise,” said Frederick Kohout, senior vice president and CMO at Cray. “IT professionals see the need to expand their use of on-premises infrastructure, like supercomputers and HPC clusters, to meet the expected growth of business-critical AI applications. Cray’s new Shasta supercomputing systems were designed to handle data-intensive workloads, like AI, and can scale seamlessly from a single cabinet to exascale-class systems so every Enterprise can start small and grow without interruption or penalty.”

Enterprise AI Production Environments Hybridized with Cloud and On-Premises Infrastructure

Nearly 40% of those surveyed said their organizations currently use on-premises systems to execute AI workloads. This includes infrastructure like supercomputers, high performance computing clusters and dedicated AI nodes. And according to these respondents, the top two considerations for utilizing on-premises systems are performance and data locality/security.

While about 40% report using on-premises systems,

65% of respondents with AI applications in use stated they need to expand their on-premises systems to keep pace with increasing performance requirements

35% of respondents are looking to move some of their cloud workloads to on-premises systems

53% of respondents noted that their organization utilizes public cloud services to run AI workloads

The research indicates that many organizations are operating a hybrid data center and rely on the use of multiple systems to run AI applications. Over 70% of those using on-premises systems have also implemented AI in the public cloud, and over half of all public cloud users also utilize on-premises infrastructure for their AI workloads.

Also of note, nearly 60% of IT professionals identified cost-effectiveness as a top consideration when selecting an infrastructure solution for AI. This was followed by the ability to integrate AI systems into existing architecture (50.8%), ease of use (49.2%) and scaling with increasing uses and demands (39.8%). With these being the top infrastructure considerations, it explains why so many organizations utilize both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. By utilizing both, enterprises get the ease of use and cost-effectiveness of the cloud with the performance and scalability of on-premises systems.

“This survey by Cray is consistent with our own AI research studies,” said Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research. “Training for machine learning requires high performance computing, either on-premise or in the cloud, and there is a significant overlap between AI investment and systems for HPC and hyperscale. One way or another, those interested in AI need to access a high-performance infrastructure.”

Other Key Research Findings

High levels of educational activity: 72% of respondents participated in one or more activities to educate themselves on AI in the past year. Over 48% attended AI conferences or received training, over 41% participated in vendor webinars, about 40% took self-study courses and over 35% downloaded and read reports on AI.

Reports 2018 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Feb. 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.

All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

For 2018, Cray reported total revenue of $456 million, which compares with $393 million in 2017. Net loss for 2018 was $72 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $134 million, or $3.33 per diluted share in 2017. Non-GAAP net loss, which adjusts for selected unusual and non-cash items, was $58 million, or $1.42 per diluted share for 2018, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $41 million, or $1.01 per diluted share in 2017.

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $163 million, compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $13 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $98 million, or $2.42 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Please note, 2017 GAAP results were impacted by both the new U.S. tax law and a change to the valuation allowance held against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The combined negative impact on the Company’s 2017 GAAP net loss was $103 million and was excluded for non-GAAP purposes.

For 2018, overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 29%, compared to 33% and 34%, respectively, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2017.

GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $204 million, compared to $196 million in 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $191 million, compared to $177 million in 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, cash, investments, and restricted cash totaled $246 million. Working capital at the end of 2018 was $291 million, compared to $354 million at December 31, 2017.

“Led by strength in our commercial business, we delivered solid growth for the year,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “While our target market continues to show signs of a rebound from its recent lows, 2019 is shaping up to be a transition year as we plan to begin shipping our next generation Shasta platform late this year. Shasta will deliver a balance of performance, flexibility and ease of use unlike anything available today, as well as a true exascale-class architecture capable of scaling well into the future. With continued focus and execution, we are well positioned to expand on our market leadership position and deliver strong long-term growth.”

Outlook

For 2019, while a wide range of results remains possible, Cray expects revenue to grow modestly compared to 2018. Revenue is expected to be about $70 million for the first quarter of 2019. For 2019, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be in the 30% range, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow compared to 2018. Based on this outlook, the Company expects to recognize a substantial GAAP and non-GAAP net loss for 2019.

Cray’s effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2019 are both expected to be in the low single-digit range.

Actual results for any future periods are subject to large fluctuations given the nature of Cray’s business.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

Additionally, we have not quantitatively reconciled the non-GAAP guidance measures disclosed under “Outlook” to their corresponding GAAP measures because we do not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items such as share-based compensation, adjustments to the provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles, costs related to acquisitions, purchase accounting adjustments, and gain on significant asset sales, as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations to the non-GAAP guidance measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our financial results.

(Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced that the first Cray Shasta™ supercomputing system for operational weather forecasting and meteorology will be acquired by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The powerful high-performance computing capabilities of the new system, named HPC11, will enable higher fidelity weather forecasts for U.S. Air Force and Army operations worldwide. The contract is valued at $25 million.



“We’re excited with our Oak Ridge National Laboratory strategic partner’s selection of Cray to provide Air Force Weather’s next high performance computing system,” said Steven Wert, Program Executive Officer Digital, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, and a member of the Senior Executive Service. “The system’s performance will be a significant increase over the existing HPC capability and will provide Air Force Weather operators with the ability to run the next generation of high-resolution, global and regional models, and satisfy existing and emerging warfighter needs for environmental impacts to operations planning.”

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a history of deploying the world’s most powerful supercomputers and through this partnership, will provide supercomputing-as-a-service on the HPC11 Shasta system to the Air Force 557th Weather Wing. The 557th Weather Wing develops and provides comprehensive terrestrial and space weather information to the U.S. Air Force and Army. The new system will feature the revolutionary Cray Slingshot™ interconnect, with features to better support time-critical numerical weather prediction workloads, and will enhance the Air Force’s capabilities to create improved weather forecasts and weather threat assessments so that Air Force missions can be carried out more effectively.

“The HPC11 system will be the first Shasta delivery to the production weather segment, and we’re proud to share this milestone with ORNL and the Air Force,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO at Cray. “The years of innovation behind Shasta and Slingshot and the success of prior generations of Cray systems continue to demonstrate Cray’s ability to support demanding 24/7 operations like weather forecasting. This is a great example of the upcoming Exascale Era bringing a new set of technologies to bear on challenging problems and empowering the Air Force to more effectively execute on its important mission.”

HPC11 will be ORNL’s first Cray Shasta system, as well as the first supercomputing system with 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ processors for use in operational weather forecasting. HPC11 will join the 85% bastion of weather centers that rely on Cray, and will feature eight Shasta cabinets in a dual-hall configuration.

“We are incredibly excited to continue our strategic collaboration with Cray to deliver the first Shasta supercomputer to the U.S. Air Force, helping to improve the fidelity of weather forecasts for U.S. military operations around the globe,” said Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager, Datacenter and Embedded Systems Group, AMD. “The 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors provide exceptional performance in highly complex workloads, a necessary component to power critical weather prediction workloads and deliver more accurate forecasts.”

The system is expected to be delivered in Q4 2019 and accepted in early 2020.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

(NASDAQ: DVCR), a premier provider of long-term care services, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019.



First Quarter 2019 Highlights

Net loss from continuing operations was $(3.3) million, or $(0.52) per share, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $(0.1) million, or $(0.01) per share, in the first quarter of 2018.

Our adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $15.5 million, compared to $18.2 million in the first quarter of 2018.

Under the new Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") 842, the Company recorded net leased assets and liabilities of $384 million and $389 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our operational and financial performance during the first quarter of 2019 continued to reflect the challenges we have been experiencing in our industry, but we do have some opportunities for improvement on the horizon. Our Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care rates all increased during the quarter. The increases are a combination of cost reimbursement along with acuity factors for our centers. We have enrolled the majority of our Texas centers in the state’s Quality Incentive Payment Program, which we expect to be effective for these centers in September of this year. This program rewards operators who maintain high quality measures with enhanced Medicaid reimbursements. We are implementing cost reductions to align our overhead cost structure with the current environment. CMS has proposed a net 2.5% market basket increase for this coming October. Year over year, our skilled mix patients decreased from 16.1% in the first quarter of 2018 to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2019. It should be noted though that this quarter was the highest skilled mix we have seen since the first quarter of 2018.""

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""I am extremely grateful for and proud of our team members as they continue to be devoted to our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

First Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.9 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 10.1 % 11.6 % Medicaid census 68.7 % 67.9 % Managed Care census 4.8 % 4.5 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 18.6 % 21.1 % Medicaid revenues 47.3 % 45.2 % Managed Care revenues 10.6 % 10.1 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 457.10 $ 455.72 Medicaid $ 181.13 $ 176.78 Managed Care $ 394.55 $ 391.96

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $134.4 million and $141.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $6.9 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 134,353 $ 136,571 $ (2,218 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,714 $ (4,714 ) Total revenue $ 134,353 $ 141,285 $ (6,932 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.7 million of the $6.9 million patient revenues decrease. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $2.2 million. Our average Medicaid and Medicare rates per patient day for the first quarter of 2019 increased compared to the first quarter of 2018, resulting in increases in revenue of $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, or 2.5% and 0.3%, respectively. Our Hospice average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 increased 15.8%, resulting in $1.0 million in additional revenue. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 13.4%, 0.1% and 10.1%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $4.1 million, $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Our ancillary revenue for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.3 million.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the first quarter of 2019 to $108.1 million as compared to $112.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.5% for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.5% for the first quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store operating expense $ 108,113 $ 109,101 $ (988 ) 2018 disposition operating expenses

— 3,177 (3,177 ) Total expense $ 108,113 $ 112,278 $ (4,165 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $3.2 million of the $4.2 million operating expense decrease. Our same-store operating expenses decreased by $1.0 million, which is mostly attributable to favorable variances in nursing and ancillary costs and salaries and related taxes of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable variances in dietary costs and maintenance and utilities expense of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $65.1 million during the first quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the first quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the $1.7 million impact of non-cash straight-line expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.4 million and $2.8 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.9 million and $1.1 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the accrual for professional liability.

General and administrative expense was $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2019 from 5.8% in the first quarter of 2018. The change in general and administrative expense is attributable to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in depreciation expense relates to the dispositions of Fulton, Clinton and Glasgow in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Interest expense was $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million first quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.2 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $4.3 million before income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. The benefit for income taxes was $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2019, and the benefit for income taxes was $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. Both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $0.52 for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations of $0.01 in the first quarter of 2018.

Receivables

Our net receivables balance decreased $2.4 million to $63.9 million as of March 31, 2019, from $66.3 million as of December 31, 2018.

We have included certain financial measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAR as EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as EBITDAR adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense and litigation contingency expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense, litigation contingency expense, tax impact related to those adjustments, and discontinued operations, net of tax. Funds Provided by Operations is defined as net income from operating activities adjusted for the cash effect of professional liability and other non-cash charges. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred tax benefit and other non-cash charges.

Our measurements of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses, separation costs and other items. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred taxes and other non-cash items. Our presentation of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

Second Quarter 2019 Highlights

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our primary update for the quarter is the announcement that we have reached an agreement in principle to settle the ongoing DOJ investigation into the Company’s therapy practices dating back to 2010. This investigation period predates our leadership team and has been a significant distraction for quite some time. We still have some work ahead of us to finalize the agreement and related Corporate Integrity Agreement, but reaching this agreement in principle represents substantial progress in resolving this matter. We ask that our investors please refer to our updated SEC filings for further information.""

Mr. McKnight continued, “You will note that we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this quarter via a non-cash tax expense item of $20 million. The accounting guidance related to matters like this is very complicated, but because of our government settlement and other financial factors we were required to complete the process of evaluating these assets this quarter. We believe we have significant positive financial evidence that we will continue to evaluate each quarter going forward.”

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""We made significant progress on our exit from Kentucky this quarter, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. Our industry continues to experience challenges and strong headwinds; however, I am proud and amazed by the level of commitment that our team members continue to exude in their efforts to deliver on our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

Second Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.8 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 9.7 % 10.6 % Medicaid census 69.2 % 68.9 % Managed Care census 4.6 % 4.2 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 17.9 % 19.7 % Medicaid revenues 47.5 % 46.5 % Managed Care revenues 10.5 % 9.4 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 458.33 $ 455.29 Medicaid $ 181.42 $ 177.58 Managed Care $ 393.81 $ 397.49

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $135.4 million and $141.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $5.7 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 135,370 $ 136,544 $ (1,174 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,538 (4,538 ) Total revenue $ 135,370 $ 141,082 $ (5,712 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.5 million of the $5.7 million decrease in patient revenues. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $1.2 million. Our average Medicaid rate per patient day for the second quarter of 2019 increased compared to the second quarter of 2018, resulting in an increase in revenue of $1.6 million, or 2.1%. Our Hospice and Managed Care average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 increased 14.2% and 7.6%, respectively, resulting in $1.0 million and $0.8 million in additional revenue, respectively. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 decreased 9.6%, 0.6% and 13.3%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $2.7 million, $0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the second quarter of 2019 to $108.6 million from $111.4 million in the second quarter of 2018, a decrease of $2.8 million. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.3% for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.0% for the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

2018

Change

Same-store operating expense $ 108,447 $ 107,850 $ 597 2018 disposition operating expenses

194 3,590 (3,396 ) Total expense $ 108,641 $ 111,440 $ (2,799 )





The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 reduced operating expenses by $3.4 million. Our same-store operating expenses increased by $0.6 million, which is mostly attributable to increases in health insurance costs of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by decreases in nursing and ancillary expenses and maintenance and utility costs of $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.8 million in the second quarter of 2018, to $65.2 million during the second quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the second quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the impact of non-cash straight-line rent expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.0 million and $3.2 million in the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.7 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims.

In June, 2019, the Company and the U.S. Department of Justice reached an agreement in principle on the financial terms of a settlement regarding a civil investigative demand. In anticipation of the execution of final agreements and payment of a settlement amount of $9.5 million, we recorded an additional loss contingency expense of $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 to increase our previously estimated and recorded liability related to this investigation.

General and administrative expense was $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $9.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019 from 6.6% in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease in general and administrative expense is mainly attributable to $1.2 million of executive severance expense in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining change is due to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in depreciation expense relates to the acceleration of depreciation for the leasehold improvements in Kentucky, which are expected to be abandoned in the third quarter of 2019.

Interest expense was $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.1 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

The Company recorded an income tax provision of $17.4 million during the second quarter of 2019 and an income tax benefit of $0.4 million during the second quarter of 2018. The increase in income tax expense is attributable to a non-cash charge for a valuation allowance recognized against our deferred tax assets in the amount of $20.0 million in the second quarter of 2019.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $7.2 million before income taxes for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2018.

We have included certain financial performance and valuation measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss), which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, debt retirement costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate and income (loss) from discontinued operations.

Our measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important financial performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses and separation costs. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

We have included Adjusted EBITDAR in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s valuation. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAR is an important financial valuation measure that is commonly used by our management, research analysts, investors, lenders and financial institutions, to compare the enterprise value of different companies in the healthcare industry, without regard to differences in capital structures and leasing arrangements. Adjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure and is not displayed as a performance measure as it excludes rent expense, which is a normal and recurring operating expense. As such, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR, should not be construed as a financial performance measure.

New Spin-Off Record Date Set for July 15, 2019



MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., July 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND) , a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, and Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today provided an update on the planned merger and spin-off transaction announced on January 7, 2019. The respective special stockholder meetings will be held today, July 9, 2019, to consider approval of the proposed merger and spin-off transaction. Subject to approval by holders of record of the companies at the respective special stockholder meetings, MYnd will issue a number of shares of common stock to the current Emmaus shareholders, which will result in MYnd shareholders retaining 5.9% of the fully diluted shares of the 'New Emmaus' post-closing and a pro rata distribution of one share of Telemynd’s common stock for each share of MYnd common stock held at the end of trading on July 16, 2019. The companies have set a new Spin-Off Record Date of July 15, 2019 in order to comply with certain NASDAQ and DTC requirements. Those individuals who hold shares at the close of trading on the 16th of July will receive the Telemynd dividend. MYnd shares will trade ex-dividend on July 17, which means that persons who purchase MYnd shares on July 17 will not receive shares of Telemynd.

It is expected that on July 16 and July 17, the necessary steps will occur to spin off Telemynd with the current MYnd assets, effectuate the merger and any adjustments needed to meet NASDAQ listing standards and commence trading on July 18, 2019 under the new symbol “EMMA.”

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “We are very grateful for this opportunity to merge with MYnd Analytics. The anticipated listing on Nasdaq via the merger with MYnd Analytics is an important step to maximize value for shareholders. We look forward to sharing with the public markets our progress on the market acceptance of Endari, which is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years and older. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other major clinical indications such as diverticulosis.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are pleased with the progress of the merger and spin-off transaction, which remains on track to close before the end of this month, subject to approval of shareholders. We believe this transaction will drive significant value for all shareholders, and we will provide further updates following the respective shareholder meetings.”

Endari addresses a $3 billion worldwide market

MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., Jan. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND), a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, today announced that it has entered into a definitive stock-for-stock merger agreement with Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Emmaus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MYnd Analytics in exchange for MYnd Analytics’ issuance of common stock to Emmaus shareholders and other equity holders. The exchange ratio will result in Emmaus securityholders owning approximately 94% of the MYnd Analytics’ common stock on a fully diluted basis after the merger. It is anticipated that the surviving company will change its name to Emmaus and receive a new ticker symbol to reflect the name change. The company expects to meet all applicable requirements for initial listing upon completion of the merger and, therefore, expects to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval from the shareholders of each company and Nasdaq approval. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as a financial advisor to Emmaus in connection with this transaction.

In connection with the transaction, MYnd Analytics intends to transfer all of its assets (including cash and its equity interest in Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services, LLC) and liabilities into its wholly-owned subsidiary, MYnd Analytics California, and to distribute the shares of MYnd Analytics California to MYnd Analytics’ shareholders as of a record date prior to the merger, which will be set prior to the merger effective time. MYnd Analytics expects that the MYnd Analytics California subsidiary, following the spinoff, will commence trading as an independent company at a date to be announced. Under the leadership of its new CEO, Patrick Herguth, the MYnd Analytics California spin off intends to continue operating, integrating and growing its technology-enabled telepsychiatry and teletherapy businesses in order to provide enhanced access to behavioral health services, improve patient outcomes and help lower the costs associated with behavioral health issues. MYnd-Arcadian customers include major health plans, health systems, and community-based organizations. The parties do not expect there to be any disruption to the existing business or customers.

Emmaus is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, including those in the rare and orphan disease categories. Its lead prescription product, Endari, demonstrated positive clinical results in a completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell disease and received FDA approval in July 2017. Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. The results of the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on July 19th, 2018.

Emmaus launched Endari in the United States in early 2018 and has experienced strong market uptake. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Additionally, Emmaus has distribution agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors, making Endari available to selected pharmacies nationwide.

Outside the United States, the treatment is currently available through an Early Access Program for sickle cell disease patients that have exhausted other treatment options. Emmaus is currently in the process of seeking marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency for its medication. Emmaus has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA which provides protection from competition in the United States and Orphan Medicinal designation from the European Commission for protection in the European Union.

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “The merger with MYnd Analytics, and concurrent Nasdaq listing, will be a major milestone for the company, and builds on our recent progress, including the FDA approval of Endari, the publication of our Phase 3 results in The New England Journal of Medicine , Medicaid coverage, the addition of major pharmaceutical distributors, and a presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 Annual Meeting. Just as important as these accomplishments was the launch and market acceptance of Endari – the first medication (FDA approved) for sickle cell disease in almost 20 years. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other clinical indications such as diverticulosis. Through this merger, we believe we can maximize value for shareholders and we are grateful to MYnd for this opportunity.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are excited to announce this definitive merger agreement with Emmaus, whereby the MYnd shareholders will own equity in Emmaus, and upon our expected spin-off, will continue to own 100% of the predictive analytics and telemedicine business, which we expect to begin operations as a new standalone public company. We are quite encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to further integrating and accelerating the growth of our offerings under Patrick Herguth’s leadership. We plan to provide further details on the new operational direction, branding, and growth strategy in the coming weeks and months.”

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle Cell Disease is an orphan disease with significant unmet medical needs, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide.

(NASDAQ: FRED) reported financial results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2019. Except as otherwise noted, the comparable results from the prior year contained herein have been adjusted for discontinued operations related to the sale of Fred’s specialty pharmacy business to an affiliate of CVS Health Corporation and certain assets of Fred’s retail pharmacy business to Walgreen Co. The amounts and percentages presented below, for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial conditions from Fred’s continuing operations.

Joe Anto, Fred’s CEO, stated, “We are disappointed with our operating results for the quarter, but are moving aggressively to right size our store footprint, reduce our cost structure, paydown our ABL and stabilize our operating model. As of June 17th, our ABL balance stood at $51.1 million versus $81.3 million at the end of Q1. We are continuing to work constructively with our banks and per our forbearance agreement, we have specific milestones related to refinancing our current facility, which we are actively working towards. We look forward to sharing updates on this process as soon as possible.”

Selling, general, and administrative expenses, adjusted for non-recurring items, were $93.4 million in Q1 2019, or 29.3% of sales, compared to $106.7 million in Q1 2018, or 31.7% of sales.

First Quarter 2019 Results



Fred’s net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 5.2% to $319.0 million from $336.4 million in the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 8.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. The sales decline was primarily the result of weak sales of consumables caused by the reduction in store traffic due to out-of-stock issues in certain product categories.

Fred’s gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 16.2% to $74.6 million from $89.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 309 basis points to 23.4% from 26.5% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage was primarily caused by discounting initiatives implemented during the quarter throughout the store chain.



Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter decreased $7.9 million to $101.4 million compared to last year’s first quarter of $109.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 68 basis points to 31.8% of sales from 32.5% of sales in the first quarter last year. The decrease is generally attributable to continued reductions in headcount and other general cost-containment initiatives implemented throughout the company.



Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $93.4 million, or 29.3% of sales, in Q1 of 2019 compared to $106.7 million, or 31.7% of sales, in Q1 of 2018.



Due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles in several underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. Comparatively, in the first quarter of 2018, no impairment expense was incurred.



For the first quarter of 2019, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $29.5 million, or $(0.84) per share, compared to a net loss of $22.0 million, or $(0.60) per share, during the same period in 2018. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to a decline in the sales volume during the period ended May 4, 2019 compared to the prior year.



Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(11.7) million compared to $(7.4) million in the first quarter of 2018.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 resulted in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which constitutes an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced store closures, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s has entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders pursuant to which Fred’s stipulated to the occurrence of certain events of default and such lenders agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to not take any action to accelerate our indebtedness or exercise other remedies until July 22, 2019. There can be no assurance that such lenders will not do so on or after such date or if the conditions in the forbearance agreement are not met in the future. For additional information regarding this agreement and Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern, please see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2019 and Fred’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 4, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 18, 2019.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation. amortization and impairment expense (i.e. Total selling, general and administrative expenses) and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(48.1) million in fiscal 2018 compared to $20.3 million in fiscal 2017.

Fourth Quarter 2018 Results

Fred’s net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 17.2% to $307.1 million from $370.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 9.7% compared to a 4.8% decrease in the fourth quarter of last year.

Fred’s gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 22.1% to $71.7 million from $92.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 147 basis points to 23.4% from 24.8% in the same quarter last year.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $23.6 million to $136.7 million compared to last year’s fourth quarter of $113.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses, increased 1,400 basis points to 44.5% of sales from 30.5% of sales in the fourth quarter last year.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $102.6 million, or 33.4% of sales, in Q4 of 2018 compared to $108.4 million, or 29.2% of sales, in Q4 of 2017.

Due primarily to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles related to underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $31.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Comparatively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Fred’s recorded impairment expense of $2.5 million.

For the fourth quarter of 2018, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $67.2 million, or $(1.86) per share, compared to a net loss of $25.4 million, or $(0.68) per share, during the same period in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(17.7) million compared to $31.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Fiscal Year End 2018 Results

Net sales for 2018 decreased to $1.272 billion from $1.396 billion in 2017 for a year-over-year decrease of $124.1 million or 8.9%. Comparable store sales for 2018 decreased 1.6% from the same period last year. Front store (non-pharmacy) sales decreased 11.8% over 2017 front store sales. The decrease year over year was primarily due to the clearance of merchandise that management identified as under-productive combined with our out of stock position of many key front store items.

Fred’s gross profit for the year decreased to $323.0 million in 2018 from $363.8 million in 2017, a year-over-year decrease of $40.8 million, or 11.2%. Gross margin rate, measured as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.4% in 2018 from 26.1% in 2017, an approximately 70-basis point decline. Factors contributing to the decline in gross margin were related to continued pressures Fred’s experienced in its retail pharmacy business, specifically related to prescription rebates in 2017 that did not recur in 2018 and an increase in DIR fees paid to PBMs. In the front store, gross margin was impacted by promotional markdowns as well as a shift in sales mix from general merchandise to food and consumables.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $452.5 million, or 35.6% of sales, in 2018 from $500.8 million, or 35.9% of sales, in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of bank fees, financing termination fees and professional fees incurred in 2017 related to the attempted Rite Aid acquisition and the closing of 39 underperforming stores in the prior year that were not repeated in 2018. Additionally, costs decreased as a result of the cost containment measures experienced during fiscal 2018.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $409.3 million, or 32.2% of sales, for the fiscal year 2018 compared to $439.2 million, or 31.5% of sales, for the same period in 2017.

Impairment expense of $33.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2018 related to long lived assets, including intangibles related to the decline in the results of operations compared to the $2.5 million recorded in fiscal 2017.

Net loss from continuing operations decreased $7.3 million to $137.2 million, or $(3.76) per share, in 2018 from a loss of $144.5 million, or $(3.87) per share, in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(48.1) million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $20.3 million in 2017.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 will result in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which will constitute an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement have indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced closure of 159 stores, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s is currently seeking an agreement with its lenders pursuant to which such lenders would forbear for a period of time from seeking remedies on account of, or waive, the foregoing events or potential events of default, but there is no assurance that Fred’s will receive such forbearance or waivers.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, announced today that the Company’s consolidated initial sales for its 2019/20 season pass offerings increased 20.8% on a unit basis and 19.8% on a dollar basis over the prior year through the discounted sales window, inclusive of Snow Time pass sales in both periods.



Jesse Boyd, Vice President of Operations, commented, “We are pleased with the continued robust growth for our season pass products as reflected in the 20.8% year over year growth in unit sales for the upcoming 2019/20 season, including healthy sales of our Peak Pass, which provides customers with unlimited skiing and riding across 14 of our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest resorts. Thanks to our investments and efforts to create consistent on-mountain conditions in the face of unpredictable weather, our customers know that their season pass will allow for season-long access to our mountains, regardless of weather. That consistency and the on- and off-mountain experience we provide are drivers of our season pass sales growth. In addition, our recent investments in customer outreach initiatives, including data and analytics attribution, social media, and strategic marketing and branding, are helping to better connect Peak Resorts with our customers as we showcase the value of our season pass offerings. We look forward to the upcoming season as we put further investments to work to create more compelling experiences across our mountains.”

The 2018/2019 season was one of the Company’s longest ski seasons in its history, including 147 days of skiing and riding at Mount Snow, 140 days at Hunter Mountain and an impressive 150 days at Wildcat. As our attention now turns to summer, Peak Resorts has a number of capital improvement projects planned for its growing resort portfolio. Work has already started on approximately $3.5 million in upgrades to the snowmaking infrastructure at Liberty Mountain, Whitetail and Roundtop Mountain in Pennsylvania. These investments across all three resorts will increase pump power and water capacity and add new state-of-the-art guns to markedly improve energy efficiency and overall snowmaking.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year as summarized below:



(in thousands, except per share data) Three months ended

April 30, Year ended

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues $ 85,458 $ 56,032 $ 184,426 $ 131,662 Resort operating costs $ 42,699 $ 31,951 $ 119,737 $ 96,593 Income from operations $ 30,402 $ 17,413 $ 28,916 $ 10,219 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders for basic EPS $ 17,283 $ 9,280 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Net income (loss) available to common shareholders adjusted for diluted EPS $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Income (Loss) per share (basic) $ 1.13 $ 0.66 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Income (Loss) per share (diluted) $ 0.83 $ 0.56 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding 15,166 13,982 14,504 13,982 Vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) 155 102 133 78 Dilutive effect of conversion of preferred stock 6,359 3,180 - - Dilutive effect of unvested RSUs 36 44 39 - Reported EBITDA* $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585 *See page 3 for Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Fiscal 2019 was a record year for Peak Resorts as we completed several transformational initiatives that drove robust year over year growth. We generated record revenue and Reported EBITDA of $184.4 million and $49.8 million, respectively, thanks to our successful Snow Time acquisition and the fantastic execution of our resort operating teams who provided our guests with great conditions throughout a season of variable weather. We also delivered double-digit growth across our season pass offerings, saw continued strength across key revenue streams including food and beverage, ski school and retail, and benefited from our geographic and market diversification and ongoing customer outreach initiatives.



“Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%. Many of our resorts benefited from our continued strategic investments, including at Mount Snow where we saw the benefit of the new Carinthia Base Lodge and at Hunter where we debuted a significant terrain expansion, contributing to increased visitation of 6% and 12%, respectively, at these resorts. In addition, consistent investments in snowmaking capacity and efficiency allowed us to ensure that our growing visitor base was able to access more terrain and more often throughout the season, even when challenged by variable weather.

“As expected, the Snow Time portfolio delivered strong results in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and throughout the season despite nearly 20 fewer operating days during the season. The initial implementation of our operating strategies at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop allowed us to more than offset the shorter season at each of the three resorts as we drove a significant improvement in profitability across the portfolio. Given that we completed the acquisition of Snow Time right before the start of the 2018-19 season, we expect to see added benefits going forward as we further refine operations at these resorts.

“As announced in early May, 2019-20 season pass sales were very strong through the discounted sales window and we expect this momentum to continue. Sales of season passes, including our Peak Pass, which allows for unlimited access to 14 of our resorts across the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, were up 20.8% on a unit basis and 19.8% on a dollar basis over the prior year, inclusive of Snow Time pass sales in both periods. Pass sales momentum has continued and we are well positioned heading into what we believe will be yet another great winter season in 2019-20. We see clear signs that our season pass offerings have become the leading choice for skiers and riders who make the East Coast their home.

“With a strong finish to the 2018-19 season and strong season pass sales for the upcoming 2019-20 season, Peak Resorts is positioned for further growth in fiscal 2020. We are already working on roughly $3.5 million in snowmaking upgrades at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, and expect to see a full year of benefit from our recently awarded liquor license at Whitetail and our continued efforts to enhance our food and beverage operations. We also expect to see further benefits from investments in our resorts, including at Mount Snow, Hunter and more recently at Hidden Valley. Looking at the summer and fall seasons, we expect to benefit from a packed event schedule that will leverage our amazing resorts to generate revenue during our seasonally slow periods, including food and beer festivals, concerts, outdoor entertainment events and on-mountain activities such as zip lining and mountain biking.”

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 fourth quarter revenue increased 52.5% year over year to $85.5 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time for the full quarter as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 11.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded an 81.1% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 34.4% rise in food and beverage revenue and 57.8% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter rose 33.6% year over year to $42.7 million due to the addition of Snow Time in the quarter as the Company managed its labor and other expenses in-line with its expectations. Power and utilities expenses were up 21.1% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity. Other operating expenses increased during the quarter due to the inclusion of the Snow Time resorts and organic spending on IT projects, repairs and maintenance and insurance costs. General and administrative expenses were up 184.3% to $4.7 million driven primarily by increased compensation expense as a result of the Company’s strong fiscal 2019 fourth quarter performance and additional professional service fees associated with the Snow Time acquisition.

Reported EBITDA for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 was $36.9 million, compared to $21.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The 71.5% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of operations from Snow Time as well as organic growth of roughly 14.3% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of April 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $30.2 million and total outstanding debt of $229.8 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and short and long-term debt of $217.4 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts exited fiscal 2019 positioned for further growth as we continue to integrate the Snow Time resorts and benefit from improved operations and greater scale across our resort portfolio. Our operating teams remain focused on managing costs and driving increased efficiency and enhanced profitability across each area of our business even as we maintain our commitment of providing the highest level of guest service possible.

“As our attention turns to fiscal 2020 and beyond, we believe we have the needed financial flexibility to continue to improve existing operations while also exploring opportunities to drive cash flow and improve our capital structure. With our focus on the continued improvement across the entirety of our business, we are excited by what the future holds and for the opportunities ahead.”

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

April 30, Year ended

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,987 4,273 4,704 (3,962 ) Interest expense, net 4,505 3,586 15,788 13,322 Depreciation and amortization 6,077 3,553 19,618 13,231 Acquisition related costs 419 - 1,045 - Restructuring and impairment charges - 549 190 2,135 Other income (90 ) (43 ) (159 ) (160 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (83 ) (83 ) (333 ) (333 ) Reported EBITDA $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2019 third quarter as summarized below:

*See page 3 for Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results and our good start to the 2018-19 ski season, given variable weather patterns and at times challenging conditions across the Northeast and Midwest. By combining our healthy organic growth with the addition of the three Snow Time resorts to our operating base beginning in late November, as well as our ongoing efforts to diligently manage expenses, Peak Resorts was able to overcome these challenges and generate revenue, net income and Reported EBITDA growth of 42%, 48% and 46% in the fiscal 2019 third quarter, respectively.

“Organic revenue and Reported EBITDA both grew roughly 10% in the 2019 fiscal third quarter, largely driven by the two major projects that debuted for the 2018-19 season. Mount Snow benefited from the new Carinthia Base Lodge, which dramatically expanded on-mountain services at the resort and provided a very popular parking, mountain access and après ski destination for our guests. Snowmaking investments at Mount Snow also allowed us to offer guests the predictable and stable conditions they have come to expect, despite variable weather throughout the quarter. Hunter Mountain also saw healthy visitation growth driven by the Hunter North terrain expansion, which has improved guest flows across the mountain and increased uphill capacity and parking access.

“The benefits of the Snow Time acquisition, which closed just before the start of the 2018-19 ski season in late November, are already evident as our three newest resorts delivered good financial performance despite a slightly later start to their seasons as a result of warm early winter temperatures. Through the addition of Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, we have diversified our business, allowing us to deliver improved financial performance across all conditions thanks to our broad geographic base, attractive amenities and our increasingly popular Peak Pass.

“Peak Pass sales for the 2019-20 season began last week as we continue to deliver on our promise to provide enhanced value and unlimited mountain access, including additional resorts for next season and flat pricing through the April 30 early season window. Adding the three Snow Time resorts to the pass for the first time further expands skiing and riding options for our guests which, combined with its attractive price point, should allow the Peak Pass to take additional market share as more Northeast and Midwest guests see the value of an unlimited, multi-mountain offering. We believe the Peak Pass is unmatched in the industry and we look forward to welcoming new and returning guests this summer and into the 2019-20 season and beyond.

“Peak Resorts has never been better positioned to grow our business and enhance value for our shareholders. Peak Pass sales grew at double-digit rates for the 2018-19 ski season as the pass benefits from increased visibility and growing acceptance across a broader geographic area, including some of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our on-mountain additions such as the Carinthia Base Lodge and the Hunter North terrain have greatly improved the guest experience. Ongoing efforts to enhance snowmaking across our mountain portfolio allow us to deliver great skiing and riding conditions even when Mother Nature does not cooperate. And the addition of Snow Time has favorably scaled up our business. The future is bright for Peak Resorts and we look forward to finishing out the 2018-19 ski season.”

Fiscal Third Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenue increased 41.7% year over year to $84.0 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time beginning on November 26, 2018 as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 9.7% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded a 54.4% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 45.5% rise in food and beverage revenue and 44.1% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 third quarter rose 36.3% year over year to $49.0 million, with the 28.6% increase in labor expenses driven by the addition of Snow Time’s operations and offset in part by lower labor expenses at the Company’s same-store resorts as a result of the Attitash Hotel closure and efforts to manage staffing levels to combat minimum wage increases. Power and utilities expenses were up 51.9% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity at Mount Snow and Hunter, in particular, to refresh terrain following warmer temperature cycles. Other operating expenses in the quarter included higher insurance costs, new groomer leases and increased sales commissions. General and administrative expenses were up 145.5% to $3.3 million driven primarily by the addition of Snow Time, one-time acquisition-related expenses and increased performance-driven compensation expenses.

Reported EBITDA for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 was $30.7 million, compared to $21.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The 46.0% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA included the addition of Snow Time beginning in November 2018 as well as organic growth of roughly 9.6% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of January 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $27.2 million and total outstanding debt of $230.6 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and long-term debt of $218.2 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts remains in a very healthy financial position as the tireless efforts of our mountain operations teams allowed the Company to drive efficiencies across the business and enhance our profitability in the 2019 fiscal third quarter and going forward. Furthermore, we have added Snow Time’s three mountain operations to our business and are already benefitting from the enhanced scale even as we plan for further efforts to drive additional synergies in the coming quarter. In addition, with the major capital investments at Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain now behind us, our capital expenditure needs will decline going forward, allowing Peak Resorts to further improve its balance sheet and cash flow.

“As we wrap up the 2018-19 ski season, we are confident that Peak Resorts’ financial flexibility will allow us to continue our efforts to invest in and improve existing operations while exploring further opportunities to scale up the business through acquisition. We are excited by what the future holds for Peak Resorts and our shareholders and the entire team remains committed to exceeding our guests’ high expectations for value, access and service.”

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

January 31, Nine months ended

January 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income (loss) $ 13,631 $ 9,181 $ (9,167 ) $ (8,328 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 5,574 3,433 (3,283 ) (8,235 ) Interest expense, net 4,458 3,529 11,283 9,736 Depreciation and amortization 6,809 3,379 13,541 9,678 Restructuring and impairment charges - 1,586 190 1,586 Acquisition related costs 295 - 626 - Other income (22 ) (28 ) (69 ) (117 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (84 ) (84 ) (250 ) (250 ) Reported EBITDA* $ 30,661 $ 20,996 $ 12,871 $ 4,070

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Snow Time Season Pass Upgrade Results Demonstrate the Strong Appeal of the Unlimited Peak Pass

WILDWOOD, Mo., Nov. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peak Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, announced today that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of Snow Time, Inc. (“Snow Time”). Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Peak Resorts paid approximately $70 million in cash consideration to Snow Time and issued approximately 1.18 million shares of its common stock to Snow Time’s shareholders at a price of $5.07 per share, for total consideration of approximately $76.0 million. Financing for the cash portion of the purchase price consists of: a $50 million, two-year senior secured term loan from CAP 1 LLC, which will accrue interest at an annual rate of 6.95% and carry no prepayment penalty; and $20 million in proceeds from the sale of 20,000 shares of Series A cumulative convertible preferred stock and issuance of accompanying warrants to CAP 1 LLC pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement.

The Company also announced today that through October 31, 2018, Snow Time pass sales increased by approximately 20% on a unit basis and by approximately 19% on a revenue basis, compared to the prior year. Approximately 27% of Snow Time season pass holders took advantage of the Company’s buy-up offer and upgraded to the Peak Pass.

“We are delighted to kick off the winter season by welcoming Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop to the Peak Resorts family following the completion of our acquisition of Snow Time,” said Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer of Peak Resorts. “Our entire team is excited to begin working with the Naylor family’s three beautiful resorts as we look to build on their legacy and further elevate the guest experience while introducing the Peak Pass and our other resorts to skiers across the Mid-Atlantic. The addition of the Snow Time properties to our growing portfolio of Northeast and Midwest operations further expands our reach into the affluent and densely populated Baltimore and Washington D.C. markets and provides our customers in the Northeast with three new complementary and conveniently located mountains where they can ski and ride as well as enjoy a four season resort experience.

“We have also seen strong acceptance for the Peak Pass as demonstrated by the 27% of Snow Time pass holders who elected to trade-up to our unlimited pass offering through October 31. We are very pleased that Snow Time’s season pass holders are upgrading to the Peak Pass at such healthy levels, reflecting what we believe is their excitement to have an opportunity to ski at their home resort while also exploring the Catskills in New York, the Green Mountains in Vermont and the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Since introducing the Peak Pass, our goal has been to provide an unlimited pass for all ages that offers unmatched value for guests who live within driving distance of our resorts and visit us frequently throughout the season. We believe this goal is a key driver of our success and we look forward to a great 2018/2019 ski season.”

As of today, the company will operate under the name Stabilis Energy, Inc. and its common stock will commence trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “SLNG”.

“Stabilis is pleased to complete this transaction with AETI,” commented James Reddinger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stabilis. “We believe that this transaction positions Stabilis to become a leading North American small-scale LNG production and distribution company. We will focus on consolidating existing LNG assets, as well as investing in new assets in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

About Stabilis Energy, Inc.

Stabilis Energy, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of small-scale liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production, distribution and fueling services to multiple end markets in North America. Stabilis has safely delivered over 200 million gallons of LNG through more than 20,000 truck deliveries during its 15-year operating history in the LNG industry, which it believes makes it one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America. Stabilis’ customers use LNG as a fuel source in a variety of applications in the industrial, energy, mining, utilities and pipelines, commercial, and high horsepower transportation markets. Stabilis’ customers use LNG as an alternative to traditional fuel sources, such as distillate fuel oil and propane, to lower fuel costs and reduce harmful environmental emissions. Stabilis’ customers also use LNG as a “virtual pipeline” solution when natural gas pipelines are not available or volumes are curtailed. Stabilis Energy, Inc. is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

This trial will enroll approximately 40 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with r/r MCL or r/r DLBCL. This trial will also explore the biologic predictors of response and resistance to dual B-cell receptor (BCR) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. Janssen Biotech, Inc. is providing ibrutinib as part of the study, with Xynomic providing abexinostat and funding support for the trial being conducted at MSK.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has an annual incidence of approximately 6,500 in G7 countries, according to DR/Decision Resources, LLC. Ibrutinib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsed MCL and has response rates of 60-70% and median duration of response of 18 months. Abexinostat as a mono therapy has been shown to have response rate of 15.4% (7.7% complete response and 7.7% partial response) in r/r MCL patients. Researchers at MSK are testing whether abexinostat/ibrutinib combo could potentially improve response rates and duration of responses in r/r MCL patients, subject to the assessment upon the completion of the trial.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) subtype according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). Researchers at MSK have shown preclinical data demonstrating that dual targeting of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in the BCR pathway with ibrutinib and inhibition of MyD88-driven NF-kB activation with a HDAC inhibitor lead to synergistic anti-lymphoma activity in MyD88 mutated, ABC-subtype DLBCL both in vitro and in vivo.

Abexinostat is a novel HDAC inhibitor in global pivotal trials against NHL and renal cell carcinoma. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class BTK inhibitor jointly developed and commercialized as IMBRUVICA® by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company and has been approved for multiple hematological malignances and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD).

Our investigation concerns whether Yangtze has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated.” The Hindenburg report described Yangtze as “a scheme run by its Chairman & controlling shareholder to siphon money away from U.S. public markets.” Among other allegations, the Hindenburg report asserted that Yangtze’s “only operating entity has been declared insolvent in China and is involved in multiple undisclosed legal proceedings” and, citing “government-sourced documents and interviews with local officials, we believe that at least 77% of the company’s reported assets are fabricated.”

On this news, Yangtze’s share price fell by more than 28%, closing at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced in a recent Form 6-K report that on September 4, 2019, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company stating that The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market.



The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting. Additionally, as of the date of this release, the Company continues to make progress with the completion of its delinquent annual report and intends to file these reports with the SEC. The Company intends to complete and file its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as soon as possible with the SEC. Thereafter, the Company intends to work with a market maker to file a Form 211 with FINRA to enable the Company’s shares to begin trading on the over-the-counter markets.

“While there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to execute its plan. If the shares resume trading on the over-the-counter markets, the shares may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on Nasdaq. While trading on the over-the-counter-markets the Company expects to apply for a Nasdaq listing at a future time.” concluded Mr. Liu.

(NASDAQ: CCIH) on Behalf of ChinaCache Stockholders and Encourages ChinaCache Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, May 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is investigating potential claims against ChinaCache International Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: CCIH) on behalf of ChinaCache stockholders. Our investigation concerns whether ChinaCache has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



Click here to participate in the action.

On April 29, 2019, ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for the 2018 fiscal year. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (“Chairman”), Song Wang (“Wang”), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

On May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019 because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the “NASDAQ Letter”). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache’s engagement of its new independent auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

(the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions. Engaged Capital and certain of its affiliates, collectively holding nearly 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, have entered into voting agreements committing them to, among other things and subject to its terms, vote in favor of adopting the acquisition agreement.

“Over the course of our review, the Committee evaluated a full range of strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives to best serve the interests of our stockholders. After a thorough process, including considering Del Frisco’s current operations and future prospects, the Committee and the Board is confident that this transaction offers the most promising opportunity to realize the highest value for our stockholders,” said Joe Reece, Committee Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“In consultation with our outside advisors, the Board has been evaluating several strategic and financial alternative options since December 2018. This transaction offers immediate liquidity at a significant premium for our stockholders while providing the best path forward for our Del Frisco’s brands, our employees, and loyal guests,” said Ian R. Carter, Board Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“L Catterton brings a distinguished track record of fostering the growth and success of world class experiential brands. Together with their deep operational expertise in the restaurant industry, I am confident L Catterton will be a great long-term partner,” said Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

Del Frisco’s comprises four leading brands across two distinct business lines -- Del Frisco’s Grille and Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in the steak and grill category, and bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar in the upscale regionally-inspired cuisine category. Upon the close of the transaction, L Catterton plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar businesses separately from the steakhouse brands in order to nurture the unique attributes of the brands.

“At L Catterton, we bring more than just capital – we bring significant operational expertise to our investments,” said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. “Over the last 30 years, L Catterton has invested in nearly 30 restaurant concepts globally to create a number of industry leaders. Del Frisco’s has four outstanding brands in two distinct and attractive categories – upscale regionally-inspired cuisine, and steak and grill. We’re excited to partner with the Company to harness the power of these brands by operating the upscale regionally-inspired brands separately from the steak and grill concepts.”

L Catterton has invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin' Brands Inc. (including Outback Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill), CÉ LA VI, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Crystal Jade, Culinary Concepts by Jean-Georges, P.F. Chang's, Uncle Julio’s and many more.

Piper Jaffray & Co. acted as financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal counsel to Del Frisco’s and its Board of Directors. Credit Suisse served as financial advisor and Gibson Dunn LLP served as legal advisor to L Catterton.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results","IRVING, Texas, Aug. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 25, 2019.



On June 24, 2019, Del Frisco’s announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton, a consumer-focused private equity firm, will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.

The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by the Board with the assistance of the Board’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

In view of the pending transaction, Del Frisco’s has withdrawn its fiscal year 2019 guidance and long-term outlook and will not host a conference call to discuss these second quarter 2019 financial results.

Key Highlights from the 13-Week Second Quarter 2019 Compared to the 13-Week Second Quarter 2018 Include:

Consolidated revenues increased 73.9% to $131.7 million from $75.7 million due primarily to $21.1 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $28.2 million in contributions from bartaco.



Total comparable restaurant sales increased 0.5%.

GAAP net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.



Adjusted net loss* of $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income* of $3.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.



GAAP operating loss of $0.6 million, compared to GAAP operating loss of $3.0 million

Adjusted EBITDA* increased 60.3% to $13.1 million from $8.2 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 10.0% from 10.8%.



Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased 74.9% to $28.3 million from $16.2 million due primarily to $5.2 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $6.9 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 21.5% from 21.4%. Sequentially, restaurant-level EBITDA margin improved 260 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2019.

* Adjusted net loss/income, adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP net income and operating (loss)/income, respectively, and a discussion of why we consider them useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.

Review of Second Quarter 2019 Operating Results

Consolidated revenues increased $56.0 million, or 73.9%, to $131.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $75.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. All results exclude any contributions from Sullivan’s Steakhouse, which was sold in the third quarter of 2018, and which sale is reflected as discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2018. The increase is due primarily to $21.1 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $28.2 million in contributions from bartaco, which were acquired on June 27, 2018.

Comparable Restaurant Sales

General and administrative costs increased to $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2018. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, general and administrative costs increased to 13.0% from 10.5%.

Non-GAAP Measures

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted EBIDTA and restaurant-level EBITDA. Adjusted net (loss) income represents GAAP net loss plus the sum of GAAP income tax expense (benefit), lease termination and closing costs, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, reorganization severance, non-recurring legal expenses, donations, non-recurring corporate expenses, and discontinued operations minus income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 68% during 2019, and (52)% during 2018. We believe that this non-GAAP operating measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors as it excludes certain non-operating related expenditures. Adjusted EBIDTA is calculated by adding back to operating income, pre-opening costs, donations, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, non-recurring legal costs, reorganization severance, lease termination and closing costs, and depreciation and amortization. Restaurant-level EBITDA is calculated by adding back to adjusted EBIDTA general and administrative expenses. We believe that these operating measures also represent useful internal measures of performance. Restaurant-level EBITDA margin represents restaurant-level EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. Adjusted net (loss) income per share represents income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on divestitures and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe that this measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors.

Accordingly, we include these non-GAAP measures so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing our underlying performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these measures as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP measurements. The following tables include a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and operating income to restaurant-level EBITDA.

Recast 2018 Financial Information

The unaudited combined adjusted financial information for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended June 26, 2018 in the following tables represent information derived from financial statements prepared by the former management of Barteca (""Barcelona and bartaco Brands""), recast to align with our fiscal calendar, and historical recast financial information of Del Frisco's Heritage Brands, which represent Double Eagle and Grille, prior to the Barteca Acquisition. This unaudited combined adjusted financial information has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s results of operations actually would have been had the Barteca Acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited combined adjusted financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or results of operations of the combined company and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved from the combined operations.

Adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted EBITDA and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. See the discussion above under ""Non-GAAP Measures"" regarding how we define these measures and why we believe they are useful for investors.

Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended (Amounts in thousands) June 25, 2019 June 26, 2018(1) June 25, 2019 June 26, 2018(2) Operating income $ (608 ) $ (7,539 ) $ (12,422 $ (4,949 ) Add: Pre-opening costs 1,301 1,892 4,050 3,303 General and administrative costs 17,117 20,631 33,489 31,888 Donations 163 16 195 58 Consulting project costs 3,450 621 7,954 854 Acquisition costs — 5,462 — 6,070 Reorganization severance 480 — 777 113 Lease termination and closing costs (1,754 ) 589 1,154 591 Depreciation and amortization 8,144 6,206 15,795 12,030 Restaurant-level EBITDA $ 28,293 $ 27,878 $ 50,992 $ 49,958 Insurance settlement (Barteca) pre acquisition(3) $ (601 ) $ (1,190 ) Adjusted Restaurant-level EBITDA $ 28,293 $ 27,277 $ 50,992 $ 48,768

Recast amounts for the 13 weeks ended June 26, 2018 include historical amounts for Barcelona and bartaco Brands, which were acquired during the third quarter of 2018, prior to acquisition. Recast amounts for the 26 weeks ended June 26, 2018 include historical amounts for Barcelona and bartaco Brands, which were acquired during the third quarter of 2018, prior to acquisition. Prior to the Barteca Acquisition, starting in Q4 of 2017 and continuing through the first half of 2018, Barteca management recognized insurance settlement proceeds from a location-specific incident as a reduction to restaurant operating expenses, which therefore increased restaurant-level EBITDA margins by the amount of those proceeds for that period of time. Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company. Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

II-VI has agreed with SAMR that it will operate separately, for a period expected to be three years, the wavelength selective switch business of Finisar. The clearance decision from SAMR satisfies the closing condition set forth in the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger regarding the receipt of antitrust approvals. II-VI expects the closing of its acquisition of Finisar (the “Merger”) to occur on or about September 24, 2019.



In accordance with the merger agreement governing the Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), holders of Finisar common stock and holders of certain restricted stock units issued by Finisar (collectively, the “Voting Securities”) have previously been provided the opportunity to elect the form of Merger consideration they wished to receive for each Voting Security they hold, being either (i) $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration”). The deadline for that election was July 15, 2019 (the “Election Deadline”), and the total amount of cash and II-VI Common Stock to be paid in the aggregate by II-VI is fixed. Holders of Voting Securities are deemed to have made no election if they failed to make an election, or revoked a prior election without making a new election, by the Election Deadline, or if their election materials were not received in proper form by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”) prior to the Election Deadline.

Holders of Voting Securities who made no election, or have validly withdrawn their election, are deemed to have elected the Mixed Consideration. Holders of Voting Securities who have validly made, and not previously withdrawn, an election prior to the Election Deadline regarding the form of merger consideration they wish to receive in the Merger will have until 5:00 p.m., New York time, on September 20, 2019 to withdraw their election if they wish to receive the Mixed Consideration. All other holders of Voting Securities who have validly made an election that is not so withdrawn will receive either the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration they have elected, in each case prorated as described below.

The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to automatic proration so that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of II-VI Common Stock paid to all holders of Voting Securities as a group will not change as a result of these elections.

In recent years, the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and the STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko, Canadian and Kingfisher) basins drew producers and private equity firms willing to wager billions of dollars on what many considered the next Permian basin, the largest and most prolific U.S. oilfield.

(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2R3NhN5)

But while their many layers of oil mimicked the Permian, the region’s geology proved more inconsistent, undercutting results and making it a higher-cost U.S. shale area for producers.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc, which turned a $3.8 billion investment in the oilfield into under $30 million in just two years, last month said it may not be able to pay creditors.

Others are downsizing: Devon Energy Corp, for example, cut capital spending earmarked for its STACK position to 20% of the total in 2019 from 31% in 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on company presentations. The reallocation aims to improve cash flow from the STACK while focusing investment where returns are better, spokesman Tim Hartley said.

Cimarex Energy also forecasts a cut in spending, to 15% in the region in 2019, down from 30% last year, company presentations showed.

“Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year,” Thomas Jorden, chief executive of Cimarex, said in a first-quarter earnings call.

Producers also are narrowing development to areas where wells have produced better results: Marathon Oil Corp and Continental Resources both have anchored recent activity on two sub-areas - the STACK-Meramec and the SCOOP Woodford.

STRUGGLERS

Geology has stymied hopes for a “Permian Jr”: Exploration wells pointed toward uniform rocks that produced high levels of oil, but producers instead encountered more complexity underground, and production weighted toward gas - at a time of a global glut and stubbornly low prices for the commodity.

“The SCOOP/STACK is not a traditional shale play, so when you think about developing it, there are a number of different rock types,” said Denise Yee, vice president at consultancy RS Energy Group. “As it’s so complex, the hydrocarbon mix changes across the play, and the oil window is limited.”

Another disappointment has been poorer results from subsequent wells. Perhaps more than any other U.S. shale basin, the SCOOP/STACK has suffered from a condition known as the “parent/child” well problem, where secondary wells produce less oil than the original.

These problems are reflected in a higher median breakeven price needed to cover costs in the SCOOP and STACK, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

(Reuters) - Supercomputer manufacturer Cray Inc said on Friday it would be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co in a deal valued at about $1.30 billion, net of cash.

The $35 per share value represents a premium of 17.4% to Cray’s last close.

HPE said it expects the deal to increase its footprint in federal business and academia, and sell supercomputing products to its commercial clients.

The deal, expected to close by the first quarter of HPE’s fiscal year 2020, will add to its adjusted operating profit in the first full year after closing.

As part of the deal, HPE expects to incur one-time integration costs that will be absorbed within its fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion that remains unchanged.

Seattle-headquartered Cray has U.S.-based manufacturing operations and about 1,300 employees worldwide. It earned $456 million in revenue in its last fiscal year.

Cray’s supercomputing systems can handle massive data sets, converged modeling, simulation, artificial intelligence, and analytics workloads."

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago said they are working on a supercomputer dubbed Aurora with Intel, the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

If the project succeeds, Aurora would represent nearly an order of magnitude leap over existing machines that feature so-called petaflop performance, capable of doing 1 quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations a second.

It also heightens the stakes in a race in which the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

One of Aurora’s primary functions would be simulating nuclear blasts, a pillar of weapons development since the ban of live detonation testings.

Aurora will be built with artificial intelligence capabilities for projects such as developing better battery materials and helping the Veterans Administration prevent suicides, Rick Stevens, an associate lab director with Argonne overseeing the exascale computing project, said during a news briefing.

The project is a win for Intel, which will supply its Xeon CPU chips and Optane memory chips for Aurora.

Intel has been fending off rival U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp’s rise in the chip content of supercomputers as the machines take on more artificial intelligence work. Nvidia’s chips are found in five of the world’s current top-10 supercomputers, though the Nvidia chips are found alongside chips from its rivals, according to TOP500, which ranks the machines.

The world’s current most powerful machine, the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, contains chips from International Business Machines Corp and Nvidia.

The source of chips for supercomputers has become a factor in trade tensions between the United States and China. The world’s third-fastest supercomputer - the Sunway TaihuLight in China - has chips developed domestically in China.

Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner who studies the supercomputing market, said that despite the small contract size relative to Intel’s overall revenue, the work done on Aurora will eventually filter down to the company’s commercial customers.

“It’s not just a jingoistic race between the U.S. and China,” Dekate said. “The innovations that Intel is developing here will percolate down to other parts of its business.”"

The export restriction announcement adding the firms to what is effectively a trade blacklist is the latest effort by the Trump administration to restrict the ability of Chinese firms to gain access to U.S. technology amid an ongoing trade war.

The department said it was adding Sugon, the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology - along with numerous aliases of the five entities - to the list over concerns about military applications of the supercomputers they are developing.

Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology is owned by the 56th Research Institute of the General Staff of China’s People’s Liberation Army, the Commerce Department said, adding “its mission is to support China’s military modernization.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment.

China’s state broadcaster, China Radio International, said in an editorial on Saturday that the move was one of a series of recent actions by the United States that violated the consensus reached by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina last December.

“No matter whether it is aimed at suppressing Chinese technology or its long-term economic development, or put pressure on China in the trade negotiations, the United States will not achieve its aims,” it said.

In 2015, the Commerce Department added China’s National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) to the list “because of its use of U.S.-origin multicores, boards, and (co)processors to power supercomputers believed to support nuclear explosive simulation and military simulation activities.”

The Commerce Department said on Friday that since 2015 NUDT has procured items under the name Hunan Guofang Kei University using four separate, additional addresses not already on the entity list. The department said on Friday it is now adding Hunan Guofang and the four addresses to the list.

The companies “pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,” the Commerce Department said.

In May, the Trump administration added China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to the entity list and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that the United States could resolve complaints about Huawei as part of a trade deal.

The world’s two largest economies have ratcheted up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China’s unfair trade practices.

The United States, China, the European Union and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

In March, a U.S. government-led group said it was working with chipmaker Intel Corp and computermaker Cray Inc to develop and build the country’s fastest computer by 2021 for conducting nuclear weapons and other research.

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois are working on a supercomputer dubbed “Aurora with Intel,” the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

Earlier this week, Nvidia Corp, a major chip supplier to supercomputer makers, said it was working with Softbank Holdings Group owned chip firm Arm Holdings to make its chips work with Arm’s for supercomputers.

Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia’s accelerated computing unit, said that the effort was aimed at European and Japanese customers rather than Chinese groups, which are increasingly turning to domestic chips.

“In terms of China, I think they’ve clearly stated that they have a domestic accelerator and processor strategy that they will pursue, and that’s clearly what they are doing,” Buck said."

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred’s said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

By Uday Sampath Kumar

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Early gains on Wall Street fizzled out by afternoon on Monday as losses in technology and healthcare stocks overshadowed increased expectations of stimulus from central banks around the world.

Microsoft Corp and Amgen Inc were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Amgen fell 3.19% after analysts raised questions about data on the company’s lung cancer drug, dragging the healthcare sector down 0.94%.

Lenders, however, were up on broad gains in U.S. Treasury yields on risings bets of an interest rate cut in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s September meeting.

Financial stocks rose 1.20%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, with banks gaining 2.62%. Technology stocks fell more than 1% and were the biggest drag on the benchmark index.

“The markets are continuing last week’s positive sentiment but with a reduction in pessimism and fear,” said Scott Brown chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Stocks gained last week on easing U.S.-China trade negotiations and global political tensions as well as increased hopes of an interest rate cut.

Cementing those expectations, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said late last week the central bank would “act as appropriate” to sustain economic expansion, a phrase that financial markets have read as a sign of an impending of rate cut.

Earlier on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not see the threat of a recession as the Trump administration seeks to revive trade negotiations with China, adding that he expected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy.

Energy stocks led gains among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors with a 1.41% rise, as oil prices got a boost from the new Saudi energy minister committing to output cuts.

At 13:11 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.95 points, or 0.08%, at 26,818.41, the S&P 500 was down 2.34 points, or 0.08%, at 2,976.37 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 22.49 points, or 0.28%, at 8,080.59.

Among other stocks, AT&T Inc gained 2.61% after shareholder Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and pushed for changes.

Boeing Co fell 0.84% after it suspended load testing of its new widebody 777X aircraft over the weekend as media reports said a cargo door failed in a ground stress test.

Shares of Fred’s Inc plunged 50.82% to a record low after the discount retailer said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.44-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 33 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 50 new highs and 47 new lows. (Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)"

In recent years, the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and the STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko, Canadian and Kingfisher) basins drew producers and private equity firms willing to wager billions of dollars on what many considered the next Permian basin, the largest and most prolific U.S. oilfield.

But while their many layers of oil mimicked the Permian, the region’s geology proved more inconsistent, undercutting results and making it a higher-cost U.S. shale area for producers.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc, which turned a $3.8 billion investment in the oilfield into under $30 million in just two years, last month said it may not be able to pay creditors.

Others are downsizing: Devon Energy Corp, for example, cut capital spending earmarked for its STACK position to 20% of the total in 2019 from 31% in 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on company presentations. The reallocation aims to improve cash flow from the STACK while focusing investment where returns are better, spokesman Tim Hartley said.

Cimarex Energy also forecasts a cut in spending, to 15% in the region in 2019, down from 30% last year, company presentations showed.

“Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year,” Thomas Jorden, chief executive of Cimarex, said in a first-quarter earnings call.

Producers also are narrowing development to areas where wells have produced better results: Marathon Oil Corp and Continental Resources both have anchored recent activity on two sub-areas - the STACK-Meramec and the SCOOP Woodford.

STRUGGLERS

Geology has stymied hopes for a “Permian Jr”: Exploration wells pointed toward uniform rocks that produced high levels of oil, but producers instead encountered more complexity underground, and production weighted toward gas - at a time of a global glut and stubbornly low prices for the commodity.

“The SCOOP/STACK is not a traditional shale play, so when you think about developing it, there are a number of different rock types,” said Denise Yee, vice president at consultancy RS Energy Group. “As it’s so complex, the hydrocarbon mix changes across the play, and the oil window is limited.”

Another disappointment has been poorer results from subsequent wells. Perhaps more than any other U.S. shale basin, the SCOOP/STACK has suffered from a condition known as the “parent/child” well problem, where secondary wells produce less oil than the original.

These problems are reflected in a higher median breakeven price needed to cover costs in the SCOOP and STACK, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

Del Frisco’s, which owns Eagle Steak House and Frisco’s Grille chains, said its shareholders will receive $8 per share, which represents a premium of 18.9% to Friday’s close.

Including debt, the deal is valued at $650 million. As of March 26, the company had $336.1 million in debt.

Del Frisco’s shares were up 17.4% before the bell at $7.90, slightly below Catterton’s offer price.

The restaurant chain in December said it was evaluating options for its business, including a possible sale, amid pressure from activist investor Engaged Capital, the company’s third-largest shareholder with a near 10% stake.

Engaged Capital pushed Del Frisco’s to add a board member, saying the company’s steakhouse restaurants were poorly managed and had rushed into buying two chains to avoid an acquisition.

Del Frisco’s said on Monday Engaged has agreed to vote in favor of the acquisition, which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019.

The company bought two restaurants - Barcelona and bartaco - for $325 million in cash last year, even as traffic declined in its own restaurants.

Upon closing of the deal, L Catterton said it plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona businesses separately from the steakhouse brands.

L Catterton has also invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin’ Brands Inc, Unclue Julio’s Mexican restaurants, P.F. Chang’s and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Piper Jaffray & Co was the financial adviser to Del Frisco’s, while Credit Suisse served as financial adviser to L Catterton."

"Shutterfly, Inc. | SFLY",Reuters,https://news.google.com./articles/CAIiEJS1TcFeGpA2Th-CDAk657IqFggEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMNT5lwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2019-05-13T07:00:00Z,2019-10-07-14-47,Exclusive: Amazon rolls out machines that pack orders and replace jobs,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is rolling out machines to automate a job held by thousands of its workers: boxing up customer orders.

The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years, which scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelops them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters.

Amazon has considered installing two machines at dozens more warehouses, removing at least 24 roles at each one, these people said. These facilities typically employ more than 2,000 people.

That would amount to more than 1,300 cuts across 55 U.S. fulfillment centers for standard-sized inventory. Amazon would expect to recover the costs in under two years, at $1 million per machine plus operational expenses, they said.

The plan, previously unreported, shows how Amazon is pushing to reduce labor and boost profits as automation of the most common warehouse task – picking up an item – is still beyond its reach. The changes are not finalized because vetting technology before a major deployment can take a long time.

Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.

“We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. “We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.”

(Dave Clark is Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations)

Amazon last month downplayed its automation efforts to press visiting its Baltimore fulfillment center, saying a fully robotic future was far off. Its employee base has grown to become one of the largest in the United States, as the company opened new warehouses and raised wages to attract staff in a tight labor market.

A key to its goal of a leaner workforce is attrition, one of the sources said. Rather than lay off workers, the person said, the world’s largest online retailer will one day refrain from refilling packing roles. Those have high turnover because boxing multiple orders per minute over 10 hours is taxing work. At the same time, employees that stay with the company can be trained to take up more technical roles.

The new machines, known as the CartonWrap from Italian firm CMC Srl, pack much faster than humans. They crank out 600 to 700 boxes per hour, or four to five times the rate of a human packer, the sources said. The machines require one person to load customer orders, another to stock cardboard and glue and a technician to fix jams on occasion.

CMC declined to comment.

Though Amazon has announced it intends to speed up shipping across its Prime loyalty program, this latest round of automation is not focused on speed. “It’s truly about efficiency and savings,” one of the people said.

Including other machines known as the “SmartPac,” which the company rolled out recently to mail items in patented envelopes, Amazon’s technology suite will be able to automate a majority of its human packers. Five rows of workers at a facility can turn into two, supplemented by two CMC machines and one SmartPac, the person said.

The company describes this as an effort to “re-purpose” workers, the person said.

It could not be learned where roles might disappear first and what incentives, if any, are tied to those specific jobs.

But the hiring deals that Amazon has with governments are often generous. For the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last year in Alabama, for instance, the state promised the company $48.7 million over 10 years, its department of commerce said.

PICKING CHALLENGE

Amazon is not alone in testing CMC’s packing technology. JD.com Inc and Shutterfly Inc have used the machines as well, the companies said, as has Walmart Inc, according to a person familiar with its pilot.

Walmart started 3.5 years ago and has since installed the machines in several U.S. locations, the person said. The company declined to comment.

Interest in boxing technology sheds light on how the e-commerce behemoths are approaching one of the major problems in the logistics industry today: finding a robotic hand that can grasp diverse items without breaking them.

Amazon employs countless workers at each fulfillment center who do variations of this same task. Some stow inventory, while others pick customer orders and still others grab those orders, placing them in the right size box and taping them up.

Many venture-backed companies and university researchers are racing to automate this work. While advances in artificial intelligence are improving machines’ accuracy, there is still no guarantee that robotic hands can prevent a marmalade jar from slipping and breaking, or switch seamlessly from picking up an eraser to grabbing a vacuum cleaner.

Amazon has tested different vendors’ technology that it may one day use for picking, including from Soft Robotics, a Boston-area startup that drew inspiration from octopus tentacles to make grippers more versatile, one person familiar with Amazon’s experimentation said. Soft Robotics declined to comment on its work with Amazon but said it has handled a wide and ever-changing variety of products for multiple large retailers.

Believing that grasping technology is not ready for prime time, Amazon is automating around that problem when packing customer orders. Humans still place items on a conveyor, but machines then build boxes around them and take care of the sealing and labeling. This saves money not just by reducing labor but by reducing wasted packing materials as well.

These machines are not without flaws. CMC can only produce so many per year. They need a technician on site who can fix problems as they arise, a requirement Amazon would rather do without, the two sources said. The super-hot glue closing the boxes can pile up and halt a machine.

Still other types of automation, like the robotic grocery assembly system of Ocado Group PLC, are the focus of much industry interest.

But the boxing machines are already proving helpful to Amazon. The company has installed them in busy warehouses that are driving distance from Seattle, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Manchester and elsewhere, the people said.

The machines have the potential to automate far more than 24 jobs per facility, one of the sources said. The company is also setting up nearly two dozen more U.S. fulfillment centers for small and non-specialty inventory, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which could be ripe for the machines.

This is just a harbinger of automation to come.

“A ‘lights out’ warehouse is ultimately the goal,” one of the people said."

Here are the key numbers:

Earnings: 45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Revenue: $7.22 billion, vs. $7.26 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

HPE's revenue declined 7% on an annualized basis in the fiscal third quarter, which ended July 31, according to a statement. The company's revenue has now declined year over year for three consecutive quarters.

With respect to guidance, HPE raised full-year guidance to $1.72 to $1.76 in earnings per share, excluding certain items. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting $1.68 in earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the full fiscal year.

The majority of HPE's revenue comes from its Hybrid IT business segment, which includes servers, storage and networking equipment for data centers. The segment produced $5.55 billion in quarterly revenue in the fiscal third quarter, down 9% on an annualized basis and below the $5.70 billion consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. Compute revenue, which represents more than half of Hybrid IT revenue and includes sales of servers, fell 10% on an annualized basis in the quarter.

""While elongated sales cycles persist and remain more pronounced for large enterprise deals there are not materially worse than in June,"" Tarek Robbiati, HPE's chief financial officer, told analysts on a Tuesday conference call. ""HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets. We have also been able to successfully navigate all of the recent tariff increases on China exports that have been factored into our outlook.""

HPE executives disclosed sales execution issues one quarter earlier, with CEO Antonio Neri saying the company had taken steps to improve.

""Fiscal year 2019 was not a year where we wanted to dial up the growth,"" Robbiati said on Tuesday's conference call. ""Fiscal year 2019 is a year where we had to deliver on EPS commitment drive free cash flow. These are the two most important metrics prepare ourselves to dial up the growth in the subsequent quarters.""

In the fiscal third quarter, HPE made a one-time arbitration award to DXC, a company that was formed as HPE's Enterprise Services Business spun out and merged with CSC in 2017. Also in the quarter HPE announced its intent to buy supercomputing company Cray in a deal valued at around $1.3 billion. HPE now expects the deal to close by the end of the 2019 fiscal year, which is earlier than expected.

Shares of HPE are down 2% from the beginning of 2019.

Deere — The heavy equipment maker reported quarterly profit of $3.52 per share, 10 cents a share below estimates. Revenue exceeded analysts' expectations. Deere cut its full-year forecast, saying ""persistent uncertainty"" in its agricultural markets is weighing on its outlook, but that its long-term fundamentals and overall economic conditions remain positive.

Pinterest — Pinterest lost $41.4 million during the first quarter in its first quarterly report since going public in April. Pinterest reported $201.9 million in revenue, but noted that expenses grew by almost a third compared to a year earlier due mostly to the cost of adding new employees. Pinterest reported a higher-than-expected number of monthly active users.

Applied Materials — Applied Materials reported adjusted quarterly profit of 70 cents per share, beating consensus estimates by 4 cents a share. The semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker also reported better-than-expected revenue, and its guidance for the current quarter is largely above analysts' forecasts. The results are alleviating some concerns about a slowing semiconductor market.

Luckin Coffee — Luckin priced its initial public offering at $17 per share, at the high end of the projected range. Luckin is the second largest coffee train in China, trailing only Starbucks.

Nvidia — Nvidia beat estimates by 7 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 88 cents per share, The graphics chipmaker also reported slightly better-than-expected revenue. Nvidia's results were helped by growing demand for its gaming chips.

Baidu — Baidu missed estimates on both the top and bottom lines in its latest earnings report. The China-based search engine company also gave a quarterly revenue outlook that falls below analysts' expectations.

Amazon.com — Amazon has taken a stake in British online food delivery company Deliveroo, a competitor to Uber's Uber Eats and other delivery services. Deliveroo said Amazon was the lead investor in a new funding round that raised $575 million.

Richards | AFP | Getty Images

Despite the year being more than halfway over, the pace of store closures doesn't appear to be slowing down in the retail industry. More companies piled on the bad news this week. So far, 7,062 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers this year, according to a tracking done by Coresight Research. And the tally could top 12,000 by the end of 2019, setting a new record, Coresight says. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time high of 8,139 closures announced in 2017. With the back-to-school shopping season and winter holidays looming, most retailers planning to shut stores this year have already shuffled through those announcements so they can shift their focus toward the industry's busiest times. But analysts say there are still some exhausted businesses teetering on the brink of survival, as sales continue to shift to the internet and younger brands like Warby Parker, Casper and Allbirds steal shoppers' attention. Take Mattress Firm as one example. The company emerged from bankruptcy back in October. But it's still suffering in an increasingly competitive landscape with newer entrants like Casper and Eight Sleep. And it hasn't been able to achieve all the concessions from landlords that it desired. All the store closure announcements have also been bad news for U.S. mall owners like Simon and Macerich, which were already struggling with traffic to department stores falling off. The landlords are getting creative with their malls, now, bringing in more food options, e-commerce brands and even apartments, hotels and office spaces. The mall model is being reinvented. Amid all the closings, there are still retailers opening stores. Coresight has tracked 3,017 store opening announcements so far this year. This past Thursday, Lululemon opened its biggest store ever in Chicago. And there's a massive, 3-million-square-foot mall called American Dream slated to open in New Jersey on Oct. 25. Below is a running list of some of the most significant retail store closure announcements so far this year.

Fred's

Fred's said Friday it will shutter another 129 stores this year, as the company works to repay its debt and diversify its product selection. It was already planning to close 263 shops in 2019. Now, the discount retailer says it will have roughly 80 retail stores and 166 pharmacies still operating following all the closures. Fred's, which sells groceries and other everyday items like cleaning supplies, has been a victim of e-commerce's ascent in many households. Its shares have tumbled more than 75% this year to trade below $1.

Charming Charlie

Accessories chain Charming Charlie filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week and said with that it plans to close all 261 stores by the end of August. This marks the second time the retailer has filed for bankruptcy in under two years. The company said it hasn't been able to come up with a plan to win shoppers back and ""ensure long-term profitability"" for the business.

Bed Bath & Beyond

Bed Bath & Beyond plans to close at least 40 locations this year — and likely more — while opening 15 stores. The company has said unless it's able to ""negotiate more favorable lease terms with ... landlords,"" the number of closures will grow. Bed Bath & Beyond, which also owns Christmas Tree Shops, lost its CEO Steven Temares in May, with its financial performance weakening and activist investors pushing for change. The company's stock is down about 1% for the year.

Dressbarn

Women's fashion retailer Dressbarn, owned by Ascena Retail Group, is going out of business for good this year. Ascena said it decided to wind down that business entirely in order to be able to turn its focus to its more profitable brands like Ann Taylor and Loft. Just last month, it released a list of the first 28 Dressbarn stores expected to close this year but hasn't announced anything beyond that. All told, about 650 stores across the country will go dark.

Topshop

Fast-fashion chain Topshop is shutting all 11 of its stores in the U.S. The retailer's London-based parent company, Arcadia Group, filed for bankruptcy protection in May, citing ""challenging retail headwinds, changing consumer habits and ever-increasing online competition."" Topshop's U.S. stores are in major markets like New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Miami. The company hasn't yet said when it expects the 11 stores to close.

Party City

Party City plans to shut about 45 stores in the U.S. this year. That's more than normal. The party-supply retailer had been closing 10 to 15 stores, on average, annually. Following the announcement, some speculated a global helium shortage was straining its business of selling balloons for birthday parties, weddings and other special occasions. But the retailer said it was able to secure a new source of helium and that the decision to close more stores in 2019 was unrelated to the global shortage. Party City shares are down more than 28% this year.

Pier 1 Imports

Pier 1 Imports is planning to shut 57 stores in 2019, and potentially more. The home goods retailer in June said if it's ""unable to achieve our performance goals, sales targets and reductions in occupancies and other costs,"" it could shutter as much as 15% of its fleet. Pier 1 closed 30 stores in 2018, leaving it with about 1,000 locations in total across the U.S. Many shoppers have navigated to Amazon and other online retailers to buy things like dishes, wall art and the small furniture accessories that Pier 1 sells. The retailer's shares are up a little more than 1% for the year.

CVS

CVS is closing 46 of its ""underperforming"" locations across the country this year. That's still less than 1% of CVS' roughly 9,600 stores nationwide. But the drugstore chain, like many retailers today, must work toward culling its massive footprint and adding unique services to stores to keep customers coming back. As it shuts some stores, CVS is adding hundreds of SmileDirectClub shops inside certain CVS locations, offering shoppers a cheaper way to straighten their teeth. It's also opening up locations known as HealthHUBS that boast services and products like blood testing and sleep apnea machines. CVS' stock is down nearly 12% in 2019.

Gap

Gap Inc. is planning to shut 230 of its namesake brand's stores over the next two years. This fiscal year, Gap said it expects to close about 50 company-owned stores, net of any new openings or repositionings. The apparel retailer in February announced its plans to split its business into two publicly traded companies, one that includes Gap, Banana Republic, Intermix and its women's and men's athleisure brands Athleta and Hill City, and another with just Old Navy. Gap Inc. shares have fallen more than 27% this year.

Victoria's Secret

L Brands' Victoria's Secret is planning to shut 53 stores this year, as the lingerie retailer struggles to appeal to women with its outdated and over-the-top bras and underwear. On average, the company has been closing roughly 15 stores each year. Meantime, online-based lingerie brands like Adore Me and Lively are opening up stores, potentially making it more difficult for Victoria's Secret to win back market share. L Brands' stock is up about 3% year to date.

Bath & Body Works

L Brands' Bath & Body Works also has some closures planned. The retailer said it intends to shut two dozen locations this year. But it will also be opening 46 stores and renovating more than 170 locations. As Victoria's Secret's sales have been in a slump, Bath & Body Works has been a bright spot for L Brands. The company reported in May that Bath & Body Work's same-store sales surged 13% during the fiscal first quarter. The upbeat news led L Brands to hike its profit outlook for the full year.

Abercrombie & Fitch

Specialty apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. said it plans to close up to 40 stores during fiscal 2019, after closing 29 locations last year. The company has, meanwhile, been working toward reducing the size of its stores and remodeling existing locations. Abercrombie also said it plans to open additional stores this year, to make up for the closures, after opening 22 stores in 2018. It also owns the Hollister clothing brand. The retailer's stock has fallen roughly 10% in 2019.

Charlotte Russe

Teen apparel retailer Charlotte Russe is liquidating and closing all of its stores, after filing for bankruptcy protection in February. At the time, it was only planning to shut 94 stores. But now, the company will be closing more than 500 locations across the country, after a liquidator won the auction for its business in bankruptcy court. Many of its stores are found within shopping malls.

Payless ShoeSource

Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy in February and has started the process of shutting all 2,500 of its stores across North America. Payless struggled with a heavy debt load and also said in court documents it faced ""unanticipated"" delays from its suppliers in recent years that forced it to sell inventory at deep discounts. It's also fallen victim to more consumers shopping for footwear online.

Gymboree

When kids clothing company Gymboree filed for bankruptcy protection in January, it said it would close all 800 of its Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores. It's since sold the rights associated with both Gymboree and its Crazy 8 brand to Children's Place, while Gap has acquired Gymboree's Janie and Jack brand's intellectual property, its website, customer data and other assets.

Family Dollar

Discount chain Dollar Tree said it plans to close 390 Family Dollar stores this year while it renovates 1,000 other locations. After buying Family Dollar in 2015, Dollar Tree has been left with the task of improving the appearance of those stores, many of which are run down. It's also been trying to cut costs. Dollar Tree shares are up more than 24% year to date.

Chico's

Women's clothing retailer Chico's said it will shut between 60 to 80 stores in fiscal 2019. The company overall intends to close at least 250 stores in the U.S. over the next three years. It joins a list of apparel companies that are struggling to stay afloat, as more sales move online and shoppers are lured to fast-fashion brands like Zara. Chico's shares have tumbled more than 38% this year.

Drew Angerer | Getty Images

The store closures just keep coming, from Dressbarn, CVS, Party City, Pier 1 Imports and more. Already, more than 7,150 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers in 2019, according to Coresight Research. And it's not even June. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time record 8,139 closures announced in 2017. Meanwhile, Coresight has tracked 2,726 store opening announcements so far this year.

With the threat of additional tariffs taking effect on consumer-facing goods like apparel and footwear imported from China hanging over retailers, things could get even worse, according to one analyst. UBS' Jay Sole recently said in a note to clients: ""The market is not realizing how much brick & mortar retail is incrementally struggling and how new 25% tariffs could force widespread store closures. ... We think potential 25% tariffs on Chinese imports could accelerate pressure on these [companies'] profit margins to the point where major store closures become a real possibility."" The store closures already announced this year also mean more bad news for U.S. mall owners, which have already been struggling with traffic to department stores, their anchor tenants, largely on the demise. So these mall owners are having to get creative, bringing in more food options, and even apartments and office spaces, to their properties. Here are some of the biggest retailers that have announced store closures so far this year.

Dressbarn, owned by Ascena Retail Group, is going out of business. There's no timeline yet on when Dressbarn's roughly 650 stores across the country are expected to shut. But Ascena said it's beginning to wind down that business entirely, and then will turn its focus to its more profitable brands Ann Taylor and Loft.

Fred's

Fred's said in April that by the end of this month, it will have shut 159 stores across the U.S., or almost 30% of its fleet of 557 stores nationwide. The discount retailer said at the time, ""most of these stores have near‐term lease expirations and limited remaining lease obligations."" Then, just earlier this month, it said it plans to shutter another 104 Fred's stores by the end of June, bringing the total closures to 263.

Qualcomm, Xilinx, Broadcom –Chipmakers were under pressure led by declines in Qualcomm and Xilinx, which tumbled 6% and 3.6%, respectively. Broadcom also dropped 6%. The drop came after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and effectively halted its ability to buy American-made parts and components. This led Google to suspended business activity with the Chinese telecom giant. Other Huawei suppliers, including Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel and Xilinx, will reportedly stop selling to the Huawei until further notice. U.S. chip suppliers are losing a big customer as Huawei purchases $20 billion of semiconductors each year.

Sprint, T-Mobile — Sprint shares surged 18.8% after the Federal Communications Commission's chairman said he would recommend the company's $26.5 billion merger with T-Mobile. T-Mobile shares also rose 3.9%.

Deutsche Bank — The German bank's U.S.-listed shares slid 2% after UBS downgraded it to sell from neutral. The UBS analyst said Deutsche is a ""levered market play vulnerable to external events and rising rates are currently a distant hope.""

Tesla — Tesla dropped 2.3% after a Wedbush analyst lowered its price target on the electric car maker's stock to $230 from $275. The analyst cited concerns that CEO Elon Musk's expansion into other products is distracting the company from what should be its main goal: gathering core demand for its Model 3.

Apple — Shares of Apple slid 3.1% after HSBC cut the tech company's price target to $174 per share from $180 due to concerns over the looming tariff concerns between the U.S. and China. HSBC believes tariff increases would force Apple to raise prices on its products, which are already seen as expensive. The bank also said there is a risk that Chinese consumers would shift to local brands with comparable products such as Huawei and Xiaomi.

Dish Network — Dish shares slid nearly 6% after announcing it will buy streaming company EchoStar's satellite business for $800 million. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019.

Tata Motors — Shares of Indian automaker Tata Motors climbed 5.7% following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings released before the bell Monday. Tata Motors earned $160.26 million in net profit for the quarter ended on March 31, topping a Refinitiv estimate. The company, however, said it struggled to sell its Jaguar Land Rover in key markets like China.

Delta Air Lines — Delta fell 1.1% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight. Morgan Stanley cited concerns that the airline's free cash flow yield is falling, and the investment bank's updated 2020 estimates which are below the consensus estimates.

Ryanair — Europe's low-cost airline Ryanair fell 2.1% after reporting its weakest annual profit in fours years on Monday. Ryanair cited issues with overcapacity, Brexit and problems with the grounded Boeing 737 MAX for its disappointing quarterly results.

Del Frisco's Restaurant — The steakhouse chain's stock skyrocketed 31.2% higher after The Deal reported that final bids for the company were around $9 per share. That number is 89.5% above Del Frisco's closing price on Friday of $4.75.

Looking for a new restaurant to try out before its lines get too long? Fishbowl Analytics has got you covered. The firm released its sixth annual list of emerging restaurant brands Tuesday. Past lists have tapped up-and-coming brands like Sweetgreen, which reached a valuation of $1 billion last year, and Shake Shack as chains to watch. The analytics firm rates brands using a combination of nominations, media mentions and social media buzz to curate its list, Fishbowl analyst Katharine Dalton said. To be considered, chains must have five to 75 locations. This year's list is one of its most diverse, representing a range of flavor profiles and restaurant concepts, Dalton said. But one characteristic that most of the chains have in common is their health-focused menus. According to Dalton, that's now the price of entry, not a distinguishing feature.

Millennials are all about experiences, according to marketing professionals. Punch Bowl Social aims to take advantage of that with a mix of dining and entertainment that echos Dave & Buster's. Customers can find corn hole, arcade games, pingpong tables and bowling lanes in its locations. The budding chain also offers a full food and drink menu when players need more sustenance. And if there isn't a location near you yet, there might be soon. The company has plans to add seven restaurants this year to its existing fleet of 16.

9. Bibibop Asian Grill

Bibibop Asian Grill lets you customize your entree from start to finish. The chain takes its inspiration from the Korean rice dish bibimbap. The Columbus, Ohio-based chain, which has 30 locations, is also focused on bringing food to its customers that leaves them feeling happy and healthy. Fishbowl pointed to menu items like bubble tea and cucumber wasabi as fan favorites. Founder Charley Shin is no newcomer to the industry. He's behind Charleys Philly Steaks, which has been around since 1986 and has more than 500 locations.

8. The Little Beet

While its name suggests a beet-focused menu, The Little Beet's menu includes a much wider variety of veggies. Its produce is locally sourced, with a number of vegan friendly choices. The Little Beet also says all of its menu items are both gluten-free and ""guiltin' free."" For now, the fast-casual chain has nine locations in New York and Washington, D.C., but is expanding to Florida in 2019.

7. Lemonade

Founded 11 years ago, Lemonade offers a variety of both lemonade flavors and entrees. Diners move through the restaurant selecting their salads, braised meat dishes and sandwiches cafeteria-style, complete with trays. The California fast-casual chain has 28 locations, but a recent merger with Modern Market Eatery will result in 58 stores in 10 markets between the two of them, with licensing and franchising plans ahead. Lemonade will continue to focus its growth on California, at least initially.

6. Urban Plates

This restaurant is already seeing its lines extend past its doors. Customers love their grass-fed steak and sustainable produce, according to Fishbowl. Like Lemonade, the food here is served cafeteria-style. Urban Plates has locations on both coasts, with 13 eateries in California and 3 in Washington, D.C. The company completed a $38 million fund round in late 2018.

5. Mendocino Farms

Mendocino Farms

The California-based sandwich shop is back on the list again this year thanks to its friendly service and varied line-up of salads and sandwiches. According to Dalton, Mendocino Farms is a ""massive fan favorite."" It's also starting to expand outside of its home market in Southern California to Northern California and Texas. The chain has 25 locations and five more are on the way. In 2015, Whole Foods — prior to its acquisition by Amazon — invested in the company.

4. Dig Inn

This fast-casual eatery takes pride in its locally sourced ingredients. Dig Inn also has it owns farm in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. To keep its prices low, the chain tries to minimize waste by using the entire vegetable. When mixed together, those ingredients result in dishes that diners love to recommend. It has taken the chain eight years to reach 26 locations, mostly in New York City and Boston, but it has much bigger expansion goals this year. It could open as many as 15 stores in 2019 alone.

3. True Food Kitchen

Last year's Number 1 emerging restaurant brand, True Food Kitchen is known for its health-focused menu with vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. It slipped two spots this year in a tight race, but reviewers still love its food, which ranges from quinoa burgers to edamame dumplings to chocolate cake. Oprah Winfrey joined the company's board in 2018 after making an undisclosed equity investment, which the chain plans to use to double its store count over the next two years, focusing mostly on the East Coast. True Food Kitchen has 23 locations. ""I think this could be the year that True Food really explodes,"" Dalton said.

2. Bartaco

Bartaco specializes in street food favorites found in Southern California, Mexico and South America. During its fiscal fourth quarter, the brand opened two more locations, bringing its total to 18. Customers ""highly recommend"" the restaurant and say that they definitely plan to return, Fishbowl found. Fishbowl isn't the only one that sees Bartaco's potential. Del Frisco's Restaurant Group last year acquired the chain's parent company, which also owns a more upscale brand called Barcelona, for $325 million in cash. The company said that it plans to add three to four locations in 2019.

As a result, the stock has gained 6.4% in a month, outperforming the industry 's 3.7% growth. However, the company's dismal top-line performances over the past three quarters have been concerning. Let's delve deeper.

Factors Driving Growth

Marriott continues to impress investors with its solid bottom-line performance. In third-quarter 2018, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.70 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 and increased 62% year over year. Notably, Marriott's earnings have topped the consensus mark for the 17 straight quarters. As a result, the company raised its 2018 earnings view. Currently, it anticipates the metric in the band of $6.15-$6.18 per share, up from $5.81-$5.91 estimated earlier. Earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 5.1% upward over the past 30 days.

RevPAR in North America rose 3% in the third quarter. Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, Marriott is well-poised to grow in the near as well as long term. With global travel estimated to witness a CAGR of 7% over the next 10 years and international trips are anticipated to top 1.8 billion by 2030.

Moreover, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Moving ahead, the company plans to significantly expand its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. For 2018, Marriott anticipates 7% net room growth, which is likely to continue building economics, scale, and consumer preference for its brands.

Earlier, Marriott announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company's loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent. Additionally, it will offer members more than what was promised by the prior programs. Notably, the company's total loyalty membership has increased to 120 million.

Starting 2019, Marriott will implement a fresh program services fee structure for owners, which will help the company to manage cost for programs and services.

Concerns

Marriott's lower-than-expected top-line performance over the past three quarters have disappointed investors. The company's revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first, second and third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, total revenues came in at $5.05 billion, which fell short of the consensus mark of $5.37 billion and declined 0.6% from the year-ago quarter figure.

Meanwhile, in the domestic market, the company is facing competition in New York due to a continuous increase in supply of hotels, which is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR in the region. On the whole, although leisure demand remains strong, cautious corporate, group and transient demand raises concern.

Marriott, which shares space with Choice Hotels International, Inc. CHH , has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Key Picks

Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Belmond Ltd. BEL and Peak Resorts, Inc. SKIS , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Belmond and Peak Resorts current-year earnings are expected to grow by 150% and 342.9%, respectively.

The property marks Hyatt's second management agreement with Tamdeen Group, one of the largest privately held conglomerates in Kuwait.

The new property is under renovation and is likely to open in January 2019. It is in close proximity to Kuwait International Airport that will provide easy connectivity to business travelers. Meanwhile, Grand Hyatt Kuwait, the company's first collaboration with the group, will be launched in 2020.

The latest move underscores Hyatt's efforts to expand and strengthen its Regency brand in the Middle East. Meanwhile, shares of Hyatt have declined 1.2% compared with the industry's decline of 17.6% in a year.

Continual Expansion - A Major Growth Driver

Hyatt continues to expand its presence in Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Meanwhile, the company's new brand signings globally have consistently outpaced its openings and this trend is expected to continue. Hyatt registered net room growth of 7.6% on a year-over-year basis in third-quarter 2018, which marked the 14th successive quarter of growth above 6%.

The company's development pipeline grew roughly 6% in the third quarter compared with the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company expects to grow units on a net room basis by roughly 6.5-7%. As of Sep 30, 2018, the company entered into management or franchise contracts for around 340 hotels or 73,000 rooms.

Meanwhile, the recent hotel addition should fortify the Hyatt Regency brand's global presence and boost revenues from EAME/SW Asia Management and Franchising segment. In fact, in the third quarter of 2018, revenues at the segment increased 17% (21.1% in a constant currency) year over year to $21 million.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer-Discretionary sector are Belmond Ltd. BEL , Peak Resorts, Inc. SKIS and DISH Network Corporation DISH . While both Belmond and Peak Resorts carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DISH Network carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Belmond has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 150%.

Peak Resorts has an expected 2019 earnings growth rate of 342.9%.

DISH Network has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 11.8%.

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

It's not the one you think.

CWCCC's main goal is to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector through education and outreach. The coalition is an integral part of a greater national effort by the U.S. Department of Energy's Clean Cities program. CWCCC is one of almost 100 coalitions across the United States who are working together to reduce petroleum consumption on a grassroots level.

Assisted by Brian Trice the Executive Director of CWCCC, ADOMANI Sales Directors Jim O'Connell and Doug Lollar were on hand to help public fleets from across the Willamette Valley and the greater Portland area, gain familiarity with two of ADOMANI's medium-duty electric commercial vehicles: an electric low-cab forward truck with a stake-side body and an electric logistics van. Public fleet invitees included Oregon Department of Transportation, Oregon Department of Agriculture, Oregon Department of Education, Oregon Department of Administrative Services, City of Corvallis, City of Salem, Salem Electric, Portland General Electric and the Port of Portland.

ADOMANI will have commercial zero-emission electric products available for demonstration and sale to public and private fleet managers, utility companies and others in Oregon and Washington over the next few weeks.

(OTCQB:ADOM), a provider of advanced zero-emission and hybrid vehicle drivetrain solutions and purpose-built electric vehicles, presented at the Florida Utility Electric Vehicle Roundtable in Orlando on September 17th, 2019.

The host utility, Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC), and Florida Municipal Electric Association (FMEA) invited Florida's electric utilities to come together for their third Florida Utility Electric Vehicle Roundtable to discuss the current electric vehicle (EV) landscape in Florida, the impact EVs are having and will have on the electric utility industry, what utilities are doing to prepare, and issues, challenges and opportunities the industry is facing. The roundtable was open to all Florida electric utilities - municipal, cooperative and investor-owned and to Sustainability Program Managers, Conservation and Efficiency Managers, Regulatory and Compliance Personnel, Renewables Coordinators, Electrical Engineers, Utility Directors and Managers, Policymakers and EV Coordinators.

Florida's 33 municipal electric utilities, combined, are the third largest electric provider in the state. Florida's public power utilities serve more than 1.4 million customer accounts and are a statewide employment leader with 5,400+ employees.

Doug Lollar of ADOMANI spoke about its zero-emission product offering of electric trucks, vans and neighborhood electric vehicles. Other speakers included Peter King of Duke Energy who spoke about choosing electric vehicle charging station locations, April Groover Combs of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services provided information to those in attendance about the Florida Electric Vehicle Roadmap, and John Paul Fraites of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection reviewed and gave an overview of the Volkswagen Settlement - Mitigation Plan and Timeframe as it pertains to Florida. The Diesel Emissions Mitigation Program (DEMP) uses funding from the Volkswagen Settlement and the EPA's Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) State Grant Program to provide project-specific funding to mitigate mobile sources of emissions. The primary objective of the Diesel Emissions Mitigation Program is to fund projects that reduce mobile source emissions such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and organic hazardous air pollutants.

ADOMANI will have a zero-emission electric cut-a-way commercial van product in Florida for demonstrations to utility companies and other interested parties over the next few weeks.

Second Quarter 2019 Revenue of $7.3 Million, Up 18% Quarter-Over-Quarter



First Half 2019 Revenue of $13.6 Million, Up 40% Year-Over-Year

Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AESE) (or the “Company”), today provided financial results for the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2019 as well as an update on several key business initiatives. As previously announced, the Company was formed on August 9, 2019 as a result of the completion of a business combination among Black Ridge Acquisition Corp., Allied Esports International, Inc., WPT Enterprises, Inc. and other affiliates.

“In the second quarter and through the first half of 2019, we successfully executed on our business plan and are excited about how both Allied Esports and WPT are performing,” said Frank Ng, CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “We are confident in our long-term strategy and look forward to continuing to drive growth and maximize shareholder value.”

Capital Structure and Liquidity

The business combination generated $20.8 million in gross proceeds for the Company. The table below outlines total cash following transaction-related expenses and payments.

(USD, millions) Cash on Balance Sheet1 $ 7.0 Proceeds From Business Combination 20.8 Transaction Expenses and Cash Considerations2 (6.1 ) Total Cash3 $ 21.7

After close of the business combination, the Company’s basic and diluted common shares outstanding totaled 23.1 million shares.

Allied and WPT Financial Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

Revenues: Total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased 17.7% to $7.3 million from $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a $0.3 million increase in In-person revenues primarily generated from the Company’s flagship Esports Arena Las Vegas and gaming truck events, as well as a $0.8 million increase in Multiplatform revenues related to the distribution of WPT content. Total second quarter 2019 revenues derived from WPT grew 5% to $5.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019 while revenues from Allied Esports grew 60% to $2.3 million over the previous quarter. The Allied Esports growth was driven by an increase in revenues generated at the Company’s flagship HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, which opened in March 2018, as well as increased revenue from the company’s gaming truck events.

Costs and expenses: Total costs and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $10.1 million, consistent with the previous quarter. Increases of $1.0 million in multiplatform costs due primarily to increased productions costs and commissions were largely offset by reductions in Interactive expenses and the lack of any additional impairment related to the company’s reduced ownership of Esports Arena Orange County and Esports Arena Oakland.

Loss from operations in the three months ended June 30, 2019 improved to $2.7 million from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net loss improved to $2.8 million from $3.9 million in the previous quarter.

Second quarter adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, improved by 35.5% to $(1.0) million from $(1.6) million in the first quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of the GAAP-basis net loss to EBITDA is provided in the table at the end of this press release.

Operational Update

Strategic Alliances: As previously announced, Simon, a global leader in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, and TV Azteca, a premier sports television network in Mexico, have made equity investments into Allied Esports Entertainment and are launching strategic alliances with the Company.

Simon and Allied Esports will collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the U.S. The in-mall venues will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events. The two companies plan to announce additional details for The Simon Cup, a co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival this fall combining online and in-person play at select mall locations in the New York and Los Angeles markets, with the winners of the regionals moving on to HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas for the final.

TV Azteca and Allied Esports will continue to work together to expand the esports landscape in Mexico through a number of immediate initiatives, including creating a 24-hour digital esports channel dedicated to esports and video gaming for the Mexican market and developing a network of esports talent across Mexico and Latin America. Future considerations also include building a flagship esports venue and additional esports and content facilities in Mexico and developing a localized online esports tournament platform for the market.

(NASDAQ:AESE)?,"A look at the shareholders of Allied Esports Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:AESE) can tell us which group is most powerful. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.'

With a market capitalization of US$96m, Allied Esports Entertainment is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions don't own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about AESE.

View our latest analysis for Allied Esports Entertainment

NasdaqCM:AESE Ownership Summary, August 22nd 2019 More

What Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Allied Esports Entertainment?

We don't tend to see institutional investors holding stock of companies that are very risky, thinly traded, or very small. Though we do sometimes see large companies without institutions on the register, it's not particularly common.

There are multiple explanations for why institutions don't own a stock. The most common is that the company is too small relative to fund under management, so the institition does not bother to look closely at the company. It is also possible that fund managers don't own the stock because they aren't convinced it will perform well. Allied Esports Entertainment might not have the sort of past performance institutions are looking for, or perhaps they simply have not studied the business closely.

NasdaqCM:AESE Income Statement, August 22nd 2019 More

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Allied Esports Entertainment. As far I can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.

Insider Ownership Of Allied Esports Entertainment

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Leading Destination Operator to Purchase $5 Million of Shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. and Collaborate with Allied Esports to Build Esports Venues at Simon Properties

“Simon Cup” Tournaments and Activations with HyperX Esports Truck to Launch at Select Simon Locations This Fall

Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (BRAC), a public acquisition vehicle, today announced that it has entered into a letter agreement for Simon Equity Development, LLC, a wholly-owned and indirect subsidiary of Simon Property Group (SPG), to become a shareholder of Allied Esports, a global esports entertainment company, through an equity investment in Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.

As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame International Holdings Limited, will be acquired, once all applicable shareholder and regulatory consents have been obtained, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. to form Allied Esports Entertainment (the “Business Combination”).

Highlights from the letter agreement include:

Simon acquiring $5 million in shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.;

Simon and Allied Esports creating dedicated esports venues and experiences at select Simon locations throughout the United States; and

Simon and Allied Esports launching a new competition tour called The Simon Cup.

The obligations of the parties to move forward with the transactions contemplated by the letter agreement are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including but not limited to the execution of definitive agreements between the parties documenting the obligations of Simon to purchase the shares of Black Ridge and consummation of the Business Combination.

Simon and Allied Esports will also collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the country. The in-mall arenas will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events.

“We're extremely pleased to collaborate with Black Ridge and Allied Esports, leading innovators in esports and gaming, to bring cutting-edge venues to our iconic properties around the country. This is exactly the type of innovative activation that excites our customers and drives traffic for our centers at Simon. Simon's successful locations are ideally suited to provide these new and exciting community spaces, complementing our other dynamic offerings,” said Mark Silvestri, Simon's Chief Operating Officer for Development.

“The agreement with Simon is a landmark opportunity to bring Allied Esports’ vision for the future of competitive gaming to Simon's world class property network,” said Lyle Berman, Director of Black Ridge. “As we work to close the transaction combining our NASDAQ-listed Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. with Allied Esports and WPT, the significant investment by Simon would be a testament to our unrivaled plans and to the opportunity Simon sees to participate in this growing industry.”

In addition, Allied Esports and Simon will this year launch The Simon Cup, a groundbreaking, co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival combining online and in-person elements into a uniquely integrated content format. The activation includes regional tournament events at select Simon centers in the New York and Los Angeles markets, culminating in a Grand Final at the iconic HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“Simon’s commitment and investment in our growing esports ecosystem will immediately strengthen our foundation for creating live experiences and compelling content for gamers and fans around the world,” said Frank Ng, co-CEO of Ourgame, owner of Allied Esports. “We are thrilled for the opportunity to work closely with the forward-thinking team at Simon to design specialized mall-based esports concepts that we hope will attract new audiences and partners through their network and enhance our global presence.”

Assuming the parties execute a definitive agreement for the transaction, Simon would purchase $5 million of newly issued shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. at a price equal to the price at which Black Ridge shareholders can have their shares converted for a pro rata portion of the Black Ridge trust account upon closing of the Business Combination; however, the dollar amount of newly issued shares will be reduced by the dollar amount Simon spends, at its sole option, purchasing shares of common stock of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Simon has agreed not to seek conversion of any shares it purchases pursuant to this investment at the meeting called to approve the Business Combination. In consideration of the purchase commitment, Black Ridge would issue to Simon on closing of the Business Combination one additional share of Black Ridge common stock for every ten (10) shares that are purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment and a warrant to purchase one (1) share of Black Ridge common stock for every two (2) shares purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment. For additional information on the transaction, see Black Ridge’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed promptly and which can be obtained, without charge, on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website (http://www.sec.gov).

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. Given the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and the Company’s pending Chapter 11 cases, the Company does not plan to appeal the Nasdaq determination to delist the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, trading of the Company’s common stock and warrants will be suspended at the opening of business on September 24, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company expects the common stock and warrants to be traded over-the-counter under the symbol “AMRQ” and “AMRWWQ” and expects to continue filing its annual, quarterly and current reports in accordance with the requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

SEATTLE, Aug. 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced an entirely new, open and extensible software platform to address the growing need for supercomputing across government and private industries. As advanced simulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation create new, data intensive workloads, the need for performance at scale is growing rapidly. Recognizing the challenges presented by the exascale era, Cray’s software fuses supercomputing performance and capability with the modularity, composability and ease-of-use of cloud computing. In a separate press release issued today, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) announced that Cray has been awarded a third U.S. exascale system contract. The system, dubbed “El Capitan,” will be sited at LLNL. Cray now has $1.5 billion in business for Shasta™ supercomputing systems and the new software platform.



“The Shasta software used with the El Capitan system expands traditional supercomputing to support the complex workflows and numerous 3D studies necessary to unlock the full potential of exascale computing,” said Bill Goldstein, lab director at LLNL. “The flexibility and extensibility of El Capitan’s software and hardware environment will enable the NNSA laboratories to explore and develop capabilities that leverage the combination of AI and machine learning with modeling and simulation to accelerate time-to-solution for our national security codes. These technologies could apply equally well to multi-physics codes employed outside of the national security domain.”

Cray has a rich history of developing the most performant, scalable and reliable software in supercomputing. This is validated by the vast majority of global weather centers that rely on Cray to deliver time critical numerical weather forecasts. These weather centers are at the forefront of the convergence of HPC, AI and IoT workloads that operate at immense scale.

Cray’s new software platform improves performance and reliability by including new key capabilities:

Extends traditional HPC batch workflow scheduling for modeling and simulation with new Kubernetes container orchestration to enable converged HPC and AI workflows.

Adds support for multi-tenancy between HPC and AI partitions and sub-partitioning within AI jobs to enable workflow isolation.

Provides highly resilient containerized services with separate compute and management planes to minimize planned and unplanned downtime.

Creates an open supercomputing platform by including standardized and supported APIs for integration, data access and software ecosystem extensibility and interoperability.

Delivers a new and fully integrated telemetry for the system as well as user application level monitoring to quickly correlate and remediate issues.

“As we enter the exascale era, modern applications are creating the need for applying supercomputing capability to a new class of digital transformation problems. What is the domain of a few national laboratories today is fast becoming a necessity for every enterprise,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO, Cray, Inc. “With our new software platform, Cray is delivering a fully featured, extensible software and tools environment that performs like a supercomputer and runs like a cloud. The same Cray technology that powers exascale systems can be delivered in a single, low-cost rack and ready to integrate into any data center environment.”

With this next generation supercomputing software platform, Cray has addressed key requirements:

Application development and portability : Developers can easily compose converged modeling, simulation, analytics and AI workflows using modern microservices and a robust suite of tools and compilers that support a broad spectrum of processors and accelerators. Applications can easily move from laptop to supercomputer for maximum scalability of code with minimal refactoring.

Interoperability: IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols.

IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols. Investment protection: CXOs and business owners benefit from a multi-user and multipurpose platform with support for heterogeneous processor architectures (x86, AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, FPGAs and other accelerators) and the scalability to meet their rapidly growing analytics and AI initiatives.

“Shasta is designed to support extremely heterogeneous workloads not just from science and engineering, but also from the growing contingent of enterprises that acquire supercomputers to outcompete their rivals in the new era of digital transformation and AI,” said Steve Conway, COO and senior vice president of research at Hyperion Research. “Cray Shasta supercomputers aim to move leading enterprises beyond proof-of-concept to production, and to operate on premises or in the cloud. By integrating extremely heterogeneous requirements into the new Shasta system hardware and software, Cray has substantially expanded its addressable market to include enterprise analytics, AI and cloud computing.”

Cray’s new software platform will be available starting Q4 of 2019. For more information, please contact your authorized Cray sales representative or www.cray.com .

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

(CRAY) ?,"How do we determine whether Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) makes for a good investment at the moment? We analyze the sentiment of a select group of the very best investors in the world, who spend immense amounts of time and resources studying companies. They may not always be right (no one is), but data shows that their consensus long positions have historically outperformed the market when we adjust for known risk factors.

Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) shareholders have witnessed an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. Our calculations also showed that CRAY isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in our short portfolio.

(NASDAQ:DVCR) Share Register?","Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!

The big shareholder groups in Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:DVCR) have power over the company. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes 'a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people'. So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

Diversicare Healthcare Services is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$17m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about DVCR.

Check out our latest analysis for Diversicare Healthcare Services

NasdaqCM:DVCR Ownership Summary, June 19th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Diversicare Healthcare Services?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

Diversicare Healthcare Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 26% of the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Diversicare Healthcare Services's historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

NasdaqCM:DVCR Income Statement, June 19th 2019 More

Our data indicates that hedge funds own 6.8% of Diversicare Healthcare Services. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Our information suggests that there isn't any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies include constipation, nausea, headache, and abdominal pain.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment, today released the following summary review of the clinical trials and efficacy findings for Endari®.

""In light of our decision to withdraw our marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine), there is some confusion relating to the previous clinical trials and efficacy findings that led to Endari's approval by the FDA in 2017,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following summary to our shareholders and the SCD community.""

Endari Clinical Trial Results

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

https://www.emmausmedical.com/content/ceoletters/ceo-letter-sep-10-2019-193

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock.

The pro forma combined balance sheets as of March 31, 2019, after giving effect to the conversion, as well as the final terms of the merger agreement and additional information about Emmaus, can be found in the company's July 22, 2019 Form 8-K filing which can be accessed on the Emmaus investor relations website at ir.emmausmedical.com.

Additionally, Emmaus has officially requested a hearing to appeal the previously announced determination of the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to delist the company's common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing, which is scheduled for September 5, 2019. In the event the appeal is unsuccessful, Emmaus common stock is expected to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Market.

""Our recent merger was a great step toward solidifying our balance sheet and providing us with greater access to the capital markets, which can help fund Emmaus' growth strategy as well as potential future acquisitions or other strategic transactions,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We strongly believe that Emmaus is on the right trajectory to achieve its mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies. The merger was one of the catalysts for Emmaus' improved financial position, putting us in a great place to move the company forward.""

Taps SB360 As Exclusive Consultant To Conduct Store Closing Sales In The Last Remaining 81 Fred's Stores,"BOSTON, Sept. 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fred's Inc., a discount value retailer, has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners as their exclusive consultant to conduct Store Closing Sales in all 81 remaining Fred's locations. SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

SB360 Capital Partners, LLC. A Schottenstein Affiliate (PRNewsfoto/SB360 Capital Partners) More

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Fred's Inc said on Monday it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, months after the pharmacy and discount retailer began shuttering hundreds of unprofitable stores in the United States, sending its shares down 44% before the bell.

Since the start of 2017, over 20 U.S. retailers, including Sears Holdings Corp and Toys 'R' Us, have filed for bankruptcy, succumbing to the onslaught of fierce e-commerce competition from Amazon Inc.

Fred's, which has been making losses since 2015, has been trying to turn around its business. In April, it said it would close at least 159 underperforming and unprofitable stores, or nearly 30% of its total outlets.

""Despite our team's best efforts, we were not able to avoid this outcome,"" Chief Executive Officer Joe Anto said.

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred's said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

Shares of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company, which have lost nearly all their value since the company was forced to scrap its bid for 1,200 Rite Aid Corp stores in June 2017, plunged to 15 cents in early trading.

On October 27, 2015, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens jointly announced an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9.00 per share in cash. To convince the investing public that it would receive FTC approval to complete the merger, Walgreens and Rite Aid had entered into an agreement with Fred's to sell 865 Rite Aid Corp stores for $950 million in an all-cash transaction in order to complete the Original Merger (the ""Fred's Asset Purchase Agreement""). On January 30, 2017, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens announced that they had entered into a new merger agreement (the ""Revised Merger""). On June 29, 2017, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc announced that they had terminated the Revised Merger. Following the termination of the Revised Merger, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc terminated the Fred's Asset Purchase Agreement.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Relatives of the late Raymond Sackler hold a 54% stake in Peak Resorts Inc., which operates 17 ski areas including New York’s Hunter Mountain and Mount Snow in Vermont. Vail Resorts Inc. completed its acquisition of Peak on Tuesday, two months after the deal was announced.

The Sacklers own stock and warrants through Delaware-based Cap 1 LLC, which has held a stake since at least 2015, according to regulatory filings. Beneficiaries of the trust that owns Cap 1 include Raymond’s widow Beverly, son Richard and grandson David. They’re among the eight family members accused in state lawsuits of contributing to the nationwide public-health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans from overdoses.

It’s unclear how much profit the Sacklers reaped from the ski resort deal, because some stock purchases may not have been publicly disclosed. Vail is paying $11 a share for Peak Resorts, a 116% premium over its July 22 closing price. That would value the Sackler stake at $114 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg.

Davidson Goldin, a spokesman for portions of the Sackler family, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Purdue Bankruptcy

Heirs of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler gained notoriety over the past several years as the opioid crisis worsened. Their wealth is founded on drug company Purdue Pharma Inc., maker of the painkiller OxyContin.

Purdue filed for bankruptcy this month to settle claims that it pushed sales of the addictive drug. The Chapter 11 filing is designed to short-circuit more than 2,000 lawsuits against Purdue and the Sackler family by the states, cities and counties that have sued to recoup billion of dollars they spent battling opioid addictions and overdoses. Under a settlement proposal, the governments, hospitals and individuals suing Purdue would take ownership from the Sacklers, who have also agreed to pay at least $3 billion and to sell other assets. Such a deal would be expected to raise a total of more than $10 billion.

Opponents argue Purdue’s plan isn’t enough of a reckoning for the Sacklers, who made billions from the over-prescribing of OxyContin by doctors, spurred by the company’s marketing. The family got more than $4 billion from OxyContin sales from 2008 through 2015, court filings show.

The lawsuits describe a web of trusts, holding entities and investment vehicles comprising the Sackler fortune, including Summer Road LLC, a family office run by David A. Sackler that provides investment-management services to Cap 1.

Summer Road has also invested in hedge fund strategies and bought an office building in West Palm Beach, Florida, for $6.8 million, the Palm Beach Post reported last week. It also owned 8% of eye-care product developer Ocular Therapeutix Inc. and about 7% of Correvio Pharma Corp. as of June 30, according to its latest 13-F filing.

Purdue made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin and is widely blamed for fueling a nationwide crisis that has left more than 400,000 people dead from abuse of prescription opioids over the past two decades.

According to the filings obtained by the Post, members of the family are benefitting from the sale of 17 resorts in the Northeast and Midwest. The Sacklers, known for a complex network of business interests, had a stake in the company Peak Resorts Inc., which owned the ski areas, according to the Post.

Some of the winter resorts lie within the Catskills of New York and the vast hills of New Hampshire, Vermont and Pennsylvania -- places known to have battled the wave of opioid addiction.

Peak Resorts Inc. declined to comment on the matter.

The sale, finalized last week, comes just after Purdue filed for bankruptcy in New York following a tentative settlement with many state and local governments suing it over the toll of opioids.

Representatives for Purdue Pharma didn't mmediately respond to request for comment from FOX Business.

The plan calls for turning Purdue into a “public benefit trust” that would continue selling preecription opioids but use its profits for lawsuit settlements. The Sackler family would give up control of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.

The ""framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,” Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue’s board of directors, said in a statement, “and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis.”

Two dozen states have signed on to the settlement plan along with lawyers who represent many of the 2,000-plus local governments suing the company.

But legal battles still lie ahead for Purdue, which did not admit to any wrongdoing. Several states plan to object to the settlement in bankruptcy court and to continue litigation in other courts against members of the Sackler family. They argue the family has funneled a fortune from the firm into shell companies and Swiss bank accounts, and is getting off too easily

A court filing by the New York Attorney General's Office earlier this month contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves.

The Sacklers are simply ""throwing the carcass of this drug company into bankruptcy,” said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, whose state plans to join Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York in pursuing the company.

Since OxyContin was introduced in 1996, addiction and overdoses have surged. In both 2017 and 2018, opioids were involved in more than 47,000 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Associated Press and FOX Business' Ken Martin contributed to this article.

While Wall Street groaned over the struggles of Uber Technologies, Inc., Lyft, Inc., and WeWork parent The We Company in recent months, a cousin of the traditional IPO has flourished, often delivering a healthy exit for private owners and strong aftermarket trading for public shareholders. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are on course to break records in 2019 both in terms of fundraising and target companies acquired. The structure, which allows a sponsor to raise cash in a new listed vehicle and bring a private company public through M&A, has been around since the 1990s but evolved dramatically since. What have been the key features behind successful deals? What elements of the structure are likely to change? And are there limits on the size and variety of deals going forward?

These were some of the questions addressed at SPAC in Action!, IPO Edge’s first SPAC-focused roundtable featuring four leading experts who are all active players in the field. The participants included Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP; Phil Denning, Partner at communications and advisory firm ICR Inc.; Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds; and Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II.

Mr. Smith, who has advised clients on notable deals including WillScot Corporation and Limbach Holdings, stressed that successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. He also believes that the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets and that SPACs that are too large can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. He ultimately believes that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges.

As an institutional investor in recent deals such as at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited and payments company Repay Holdings Corporation, Mr. Greenberg noted that SPACs offer distinct advantages over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg said he was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Story continues

Mr. Heyer brings perspective as both the CEO of two recent SPACs and a veteran business executive with decades of experience. He believes that SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. Mr. Heyer’s latest deal was to bring OneSpaWorld public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target.

Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group, said that SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs.

The complete interviews with each of the four roundtable participants can be found below.





Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP

Successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. Often the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets. And while some SPAC IPOs have approached a billion dollars, huge SPACs can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. That’s according to Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP, which has advised clients in SPAC transactions including New Frontier Corporation, Netfin Acquisition Corp., WillScot Corporation, Target Hospitality, and Limbach Holdings. Mr. Smith also says that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges. The full interview is below.

Elliott M. Smith focuses his practice on corporate and securities law. Elliott advises clients on a wide variety of capital markets transactional matters, including IPOs, follow-on offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities. Elliott has particular experience representing SPACs and their sponsor teams in IPOs and back-end business combinations. Elliott also advises public company clients on corporate governance matters and compliance with the federal securities laws.

IPO Edge: How has the warrant feature on SPACs evolved and where do you see it going?

Mr. Smith: Way back in the 1990s, SPACs issued units consisting of one share and two warrants, one of which was struck in-the-money, meaning the strike price was below the per-unit IPO price. The in-the-money warrant functioned like an immediate capital raise following the closing of a business combination, but created a lot of dilution to stockholders which put pressure on the stock price. In the 2000s, SPAC IPO units evolved to typically include one in-the-money warrant. Towards the end of that cycle, around 2008, SPACs starting issuing units with one share and one warrant which was struck out-of-the-money.

These days, SPACs issue units in their IPO for $10.00, and the units include a share and a warrant (or a fraction of warrant). The warrants have an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Some repeat sponsor teams or sponsors affiliated with well-known private equity funds are able to leverage their deal-making track record in order to reduce the number of warrants issued as part of the units to one-half or even one-third of a warrant. By reducing the warrant coverage (i.e., the number of shares issuable upon exercise of all the warrants), these sponsors can market their SPACs as more attractive vehicles to target companies and investors as compared to other SPACs that have more warrants outstanding, since the former represent less potential dilution to stockholders upon completion of the business combination.

The warrants are a necessary sweetener in order to bring investors into a SPAC’s IPO, but can be unattractive to potential investors in the stock later on after a business combination because of the overhang. Over the years SPACs have tried to mitigate this by eliminating or ‘cleaning up’ the warrants at the time of the business combination or shortly thereafter, usually through amendments to the warrant agreement that effectively convert the warrants into cash and/or shares. In terms of the future, warrants will likely always be part of a SPAC’s IPO units in one form or another, and I don’t see SPAC units including less than one-third of a warrant anytime soon.

IPO Edge: How do you convince investors to take fewer warrants with their IPO shares?

Mr. Smith: It’s really a function of investors’ regard for the quality of the sponsor team and their track record and the investors’ perception of their ability to find a good target business and complete a business combination. Top-tier sponsor teams that generate a lot of investor interest in their IPOs can offer less favorable terms (i.e., less warrants). First-time sponsor teams rarely can get away with including less than a full warrant in their SPAC units. And when the market slows down, even repeat sponsors will sweeten their IPOs with additional warrant coverage in order to get the IPO sold.

IPO Edge: What are the key ingredients in getting a SPAC IPO to work?

Mr. Smith: Frankly, in recent years we’ve seen a lot of first-time sponsor teams able to complete IPOs, which makes it look like it’s not too difficult to raise a SPAC if the sponsors are willing to provide favorable terms to IPO investors, such as overfunding the trust account or providing significant warrant coverage.

That said, we have seen some IPOs downsize or get pulled due to investor skepticism of teams that come in to SPACs who have not been involved in public deals or growth equity transactions before, like distressed asset investors, or even successful executives who want to do a SPAC because they like the look of the potential returns but don’t have much of a track record for deal making. The SPAC product is really best suited to growth equity stories where the right combination of a savvy sponsor and a solid target business generate investor interest. Distressed assets and value transactions have generally not fared so well with SPACs.

IPO Edge: Some SPACs have recently raised several hundred million dollars in their IPOs. Can they keep growing? What are the remaining issues?

Mr. Smith: In the past few years the size of SPAC IPOs has increased, in some instances to nearly a billion dollars. But oddly enough there are challenges with big SPACs. Generally, in order to mitigate the dilution from the founder shares and warrants, a target business should be 3-4x the value of the SPAC’s trust account. Finding a target business with valuation of $2+ billion can be challenging for SPACs. Companies that size often don’t need some of the things a SPAC offers and can just go do a traditional IPO if desired. So the pool of target companies can be smaller for big SPACs and we’ve had some sponsor teams ask whether it’s possible to reduce a SPAC’s size after the IPO, which is not really possible. As a result, depending on the industry in which a SPAC is focused, we see repeat sponsors opting to raise SPACs in the $200-$400 million range for maximum flexibility to look for a target 3-4x its size, or sometimes larger. If needed, SPACs can scale up for larger deals by raising additional capital at the time of the business combination.

IPO Edge: What kind of advantages do combinations with SPACs have over traditional IPOs?

Mr. Smith: It can be faster, easier, and often cheaper to go public through a SPAC than a traditional IPO. The traditional IPO process typically takes 9-18 months. A SPAC business combination can get done in four months.

With SPACs, there’s greater flexibility regarding deal structuring, marketing materials and communications with investors. Target sellers can take more cash off the table than is otherwise possible in a traditional IPO. SPAC marketing materials can include projections, which is rare for IPOs. There is also flexibility on timing. In an IPO, if the market is not there, the deal often will need to be pulled and the company is back to square one. With SPACs, the transaction terms can be re-cut to be more favorable to investors, additional capital can be brought in through a PIPE or debt financing if needed, and these changes can be made in real time during the marketing process right up until the closing. In an IPO, those kinds of changes would need to be pushed through a Form S-1 and would likely delay the SEC review process, so that’s another advantage for SPACs.

One potential downside of all that flexibility with SPACs is that sponsors and targets can get deals done even if the transaction is not well received by the market. That can lead to real challenges for the post-closing company. If too many public investors redeem at the time of the business combination, the stock will be thinly traded which can make it hard to raise additional capital. It can be challenging for post-SPAC companies to attract institutions to invest in the secondary market if there is low trading volume in the company’s stock.

Another thing to remember is that with a traditional IPO, the Company is typically selling a minority stake in the company to the public, so the potential to be oversubscribed can be higher. In a traditional IPO, the offering size can be calibrated to investor demand and the underwriters can ensure there is healthy aftermarket trading in the stock. With a SPAC, particularly the large ones, sponsors have to turn over all the outstanding stock of the SPAC, which can soak up all the demand in the market make for choppy trading following the closing.

IPO Edge: What about limitations on SPACs and can they be improved?

Mr. Smith: The product itself is inherently flexible to accommodate all types of transactions. It’s really about the sponsor team and the kind of target business that they bring to the market. If a SPAC doesn’t bring a good target business to its shareholders, then it doesn’t matter what the warrant coverage is or if the founders are giving up some of their founder shares, public stockholders will redeem their shares and the stock price is going to suffer. On the other hand, we’ve seen SPACs that have a full warrant do a deal that is well received and they are able to withstand the overhang issue and create value for investors post-closing. So it’s really a function of the quality of the transaction, as well as the target management team’s ability to execute on its growth plan.

That said, there are headwinds for SPACs. One is perception. People continue to view SPACs as high risk. Unfortunately, there are several examples of deals that have gone south after closing, or people remember 2008 when several SPACs liquidated with no deal. Unfortunately, with each business combination that gets done and the stock price tanks, it’s a ding on the SPAC product, which isn’t really right but it’s about the perception.

Some think that SPACs have a tendency to overpay when time is running out for them and they need to find a deal. There’s probably some truth to that, but again, if a sponsor team and target company’s sellers understand the product and the process and are focused on positioning the company to perform post-closing, then I think those negative factors can be overcome.

Lastly, we’ve heard some sponsors lament that their banks don’t ‘show up’ for them to market the business combination with the same energy compared to a traditional IPO. That may be because of how the deferred underwriting fee gets allocated within the bank, and so there probably is room for improvement there that would help back-end deals get executed successfully.





Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds

SPACs can offer distinct advantages to institutional investors over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. That’s according to Cliff Greenberg, SVP and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds, which has invested in a number of recent SPAC companies including at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld (ticker: OSW) and payments company Repay Holdings (ticker: RPAY). Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Cliff Greenberg is the Portfolio Manager of Baron Small Cap Fund. He invests in small-sized U.S. companies with significant growth potential. Investments include fallen angels with strong long-term franchises that have disappointed investors, and special situations where lack of investor awareness creates opportunities. Mr. Greenberg has 35 years of investing experience, including 22 years at Baron Funds.

IPO Edge: Your fund was instrumental in the process of Repay going public through a SPAC, with Baron Funds participating in a private placement that helped extinguish 75% of the warrants in the deal. How did you view that situation?

Mr. Greenberg: Repay had enough money to close the deal, but we advised them to take a little more to immediately buy the warrants. The warrants were dilutive and added confusion to the capital structure. We also preferred that they run with a little less leverage and have more capital to pursue accretive acquisitions.

IPO Edge: SPACs have been raising larger and larger amounts of money. What’s your view on investing in a SPAC at the time of IPO?

Mr. Greenberg: I don’t like to invest in blind pools. I invest in companies, so my approach is to wait until the SPAC identifies a target and then decide.

Sometimes, I’ll put more money in if they need it like I did with Repay. In other cases, I’ll just go out and buy SPAC shares in the market as we did with Clarivate.

IPO Edge: What do you like about SPACs compared with IPOs?

Mr. Greenberg: I can get size with a SPAC. In a regular IPO, I may get $5 million or $10 million in the allocation. But then the stock may jump, and I won’t want to buy any more since it’s too expensive. You’re often not able to establish a full position at a reasonable price.

A big advantage with a SPAC is that I can invest more capital upfront at what I believe is a reasonable price.

Another advantage is there is more disclosure and more time to do due diligence. You can learn more about a SPAC’s acquisition target, see projections, and communicate with management. I take advantage of the ability to meet these companies and get to know them well before investing.

IPO Edge: What’s contributed to the success of SPACs over time?

Mr. Greenberg: There has been an evolution. These used to be $20, $50, $100 million raises. They were acquiring flaky companies and there was a big risk that the deal wouldn’t get approved. Also excess compensation was going to sponsors who didn’t play a role in the acquired companies.

Now, you have $300, $400, $500 million raised. The sponsors are playing a very significant role in the future of the company and are more reasonably compensated for their role.

IPO Edge: Getting back to the Repay deal, what role do you think warrants will play going forward?

Mr. Greenberg: Warrants complicate financial structures and are dilutive. There used to be two warrants issued per share, then one. You’ve had deals done with less than one warrant and there are some in the market now with a quarter of a warrant, which is a favorable development for new long-term investors.

Investors aren’t demanding as many goodies upfront as they were in the past. Institutional buyers don’t need as much incentive.

It’s a positive that Repay was able to retire a good portion of the warrants that were issued upon approval of the deal. I believe this will be emulated going forward and is a major positive.

Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II

SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. That’s according to Steven Heyer, a veteran business executive who brought OneSpaWorld Holdings (ticker: OSW) public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean, has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target. The full interview is below.

Steven Heyer is Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II. He is also lead director of OneSpaWorld Holdings and serves as a director of Lazard Ltd and Lazard Group. Mr. Heyer has over 40 years of experience in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries leading a range of companies and brands. He has applied his leadership and analytical skills in a variety of leadership positions across diverse industry groups, including broadcast media, consumer products, along with hotel and leisure companies. Mr. Heyer was the Chief Executive Officer of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and President and Chief Operating Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. He also was President and Chief Operating Officer of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., and a member of AOL Time Warner’s Operating Committee. Among other roles, he is an advisor and director to, and investor in, several private companies, including startups and turnarounds.

IPO Edge: What type of leadership qualities are most important in a successful SPAC?

Mr. Heyer: The most successful SPACs should have a mix of an operator who can see the potential in a business and someone with the financial mind needed to craft a deal. I really enjoyed working with Andy on Haymaker and we’re doing the same thing with Haymaker II. I’ve come to love him even more.

IPO Edge: What kind of company makes a good SPAC target?

Mr. Heyer: You look for a good business that has both growth and free cash flow. It should be differentiated from the rest of the market with a wide moat around the business. OneSpaWorld has all of those features and we were able to get a deal done with a fabulous company. We had almost no redemptions and great enthusiasm for the transaction.

IPO Edge: What are the reasons to do a SPAC versus a traditional IPO?

Mr. Heyer: If the owner wants to take significant money off the table immediately, a SPAC is better. It’s also an opportunity for the owner to roll some of the investment to participate in the upside of a well-performing stock.

However, for a SPAC to succeed, you need trust and motivation on both sides. That’s how we got a friendly, fast negotiation with OneSpaWorld.

IPO Edge: Is there a size limitation for SPAC IPOs? What’s helping them get bigger?

Mr. Heyer: We raised $400 million for Haymaker II but it could be a billion dollars. The issue is that you’re probably looking for a middle market deal, so you don’t need that much in the SPAC IPO. You’re not going to raise $5 billion.

With a more successful track record, you can attract investors who want to bet on your team before the target is known.

IPO Edge: How have SPACs been perceived over the years?

Mr. Heyer: If you go back 20 years, SPAC was a dirty word. The reason is that people were using them to line their pockets. They were being bad stewards. Even recently, we had a handful of investors who had a knee-jerk negative reaction to a SPAC because of that history. But with more successful deals, attitudes are changing. It’s evolved from being a niche vehicle to becoming a real asset class.

IPO Edge: You talked about cash flow. Could a SPAC deal be done with a fast-growing company that’s not yet profitable?

Mr. Heyer: I would do it if the growth story were compelling enough and the potential for meaningful profit creation was clear. The expectation needs to be that the business can float on its own and doesn’t hinge on a dozen promises or flawless integration. At some point it stretches credibility.

Phil Denning, Partner, ICR Inc.

SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. That’s according to Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay Holdings (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs. The full interview is below:

IPO Edge: What has been the main driver of the success of SPACs in the last several months?

Mr. Denning: One key feature of many successful deals has been the presence of a well-regarded private equity firm that has elected to keep a significant stake in the company after it goes public. It not only sends the message that the private equity firm believes in the business, but can be helpful as the company plots its strategy moving forward. We saw that with both OneSpaWorld, which has L Catterton as a shareholder and Repay, which has Corsair Capital as a shareholder. The role of the private equity firm is generally to advise in the form of one or more board directors. But you can also go with informal advisory roles or even more formal – such as an executive position created.

There has also been an element of creativity in recent deals that made them succeed. The Repay deal would have closed without the PIPE investors, but their additional capital made the terms even better because of the dilution that was eliminated. I think that the flexible nature of the product has fostered creative thinking, which has led to success.

IPO Edge: Warrant “coverage” has decreased in many recent deals – with some as low as ¼ per share. Do you believe that the warrant feature is likely to keep shrinking or do some deals need them?

Mr. Denning: The warrant can be a great incentive to get investors into a SPAC IPO, especially with a team that has a lot of potential but not a proven track record. There are investors out there who really just buy into a deal to get the warrant and have no intention of keeping the shares, and that’s fine – because it helps get the cash raised. But the idea is to attract investors who believe enough in a management team that they want to stick with the SPAC shares and wind up owning the target company.

You will probably always need some warrant feature to keep investors incentivized. After all, if you’re going to let your cash sit in a trust account and just earn minimal interest, you need a carrot.

There will be deals with very small fractions of a warrant. Those are going to be the SPACs whose leadership have very strong track records. For those newer to the game, a full warrant per share is probably going to remain the norm.

IPO Edge: Do you expect SPACs to get even larger in the next few years?

Mr. Denning: I actually think that SPACs under a billion dollars are the ideal size. If you get much bigger the company is probably best suited to go the typical IPO route.

The reason why SPACs may do so well at the current size is that there’s plethora of middle-market target companies owned by private equity. Many of those private equity firms are in a difficult position because the companies aren’t an ideal fit for an IPO, meaning they can only rally be sold to a strategic or another private equity firm. So SPACs have created an entirely new exit path.

And SPACs are more appealing than a straight sale because many private equity owners want to participate in further upside. If you sell the company to another firm, you obviously can’t do that.

IPO Edge: What are the key advantages to going public via a SPAC rather than a traditional IPO?

Mr. Denning: One major advantage I have observed relates to disclosure. With a SPAC, it’s relatively easy to communicate a target company’s growth plans once the deal is announced. You’re able to show the investment community specific targets for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda that you can’t with a traditional IPO. That takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for potential investors.

Another advantage from the perspective of a company owner is the ability to sell a large stake but also remain a significant holder. With an IPO, you’re really only selling a sliver of the company at the time of the deal.

SPACs can also happen much more quickly. If you raise money and find a target right away, a deal can be done in a matter of months. The IPO process is much more long and arduous.

IPO Edge: Are there specific industries that are best suited for SPACs?

Mr. Denning: There has been a lot of success with consumer and consumer-related deals, looking back to Hostess Brands and more recently to OneSpaWorld. But I think there is plenty of scope to grow in different industries. Just recently we had a real-estate SPAC deal announced with Broadmark, which is merging with Trinity Merger Corp. (ticker: TMCX). I would expect sponsors to get more creative as we see successful deals done in new industries.

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.'

With a market capitalization of US$635m, Repay Holdings is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about RPAY.

NasdaqCM:RPAY Ownership Summary, August 9th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Repay Holdings?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that Repay Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold 23% of the stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Repay Holdings's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

NasdaqCM:RPAY Income Statement, August 9th 2019 More

It would appear that 3.7% of Repay Holdings shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Repay Holdings

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

(“Chart”) (GTLS) announced a strategic investment in Stabilis Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLNG) (“Stabilis”) of up to $7 million for up to 9% of common equity. The transaction is scheduled to close within the next thirty days subject to both parties meeting certain closing conditions. The actual investment and ownership will be determined by an agreed upon formula at closing.

Small-scale LNG is a key aspect of the global LNG infrastructure buildout, as these smaller liquefaction plants serve specific uses such as marine bunkering, fuel for over the road transport, gas-LDC peak storage and power generation. Stabilis and Chart together built a 100,000 LNG gallon per day liquefier in Texas, with the intended purpose to service multiple end markets, including energy, industrial, mining, and Mexican exports. Chart supplied the liquefaction train, storage, gas pre-treatment, and truck loading facilities, which contributed to the record production levels of the plant.

“We are pleased to announce this strategic investment in Stabilis Energy,” said Jill Evanko, Chief Executive Officer of Chart. “We look forward to providing equipment and process to Stabilis and other customers as they expand in the small-scale and utility-scale LNG market. We expect over $650 million of opportunity in this market for our products in the next three years.”

“Stabilis welcomes Chart Industries as a shareholder,” commented James Reddinger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stabilis. “As a global market leader in LNG production equipment and process systems, we appreciate Chart’s confidence in us. This transaction better positions Stabilis to pursue our North American small-scale LNG growth strategy, which is currently focused on plant development opportunities in the United States and Mexico.”

Reddinger continued, “Chart’s investment will increase our publicly traded float and total shares outstanding, thereby helping Stabilis meet its NASDAQ listing requirements. Furthermore, the investment will reduce our financial leverage and give us a stronger balance sheet to support our growth plans.”

Stabilis completed a share exchange transaction with American Electric Technologies, Inc. on July 26, 2019 and subsequently commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “SLNG” on July 29, 2019.

Chart Industries and Stabilis Energy will hold a joint conference call at 1:30pm eastern time tomorrow, August 6, 2019. Participants may join the call by using the toll-free dial-in number of 877-312-9395, or internationally 970-315-0456. The conference ID is 1987854.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

Its current pipeline mainly consists of 3 drug candidates; Xynomic owns global exclusive development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to each of these. Its lead drug candidate, abexinostat, is in global potentially pivotal clinical trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (in combination with pazopanib) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (as a single agent).

Xynomic’s pre-clinical oncology drug candidate XP-102 (BI 882370) is a pan-RAF inhibitor.

So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

Does Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 69% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Do The Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?

The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings. Nice! Along with insider transactions, I recommend checking if Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is growing revenue. This free chart of historic revenue and earnings should make that easy.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (NASDAQ:YRIV).

What Is Insider Selling?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

See our latest analysis for Yangtze River Port and Logistics

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Yangtze River Port and Logistics

Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Director, James Coleman, for US$402k worth of shares, at about US$1.14 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$0.89. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. The only individual insider seller over the last year was James Coleman.

James Coleman divested 513k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$1.05. The chart below shows insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Does Yangtze River Port and Logistics Boast High Insider Ownership?

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Yangtze River Port and Logistics insiders own about US$104m worth of shares (which is 68% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Yangtze River Port and Logistics Insiders?

An insider hasn't bought Yangtze River Port and Logistics stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP (“Scott+Scott”), an international securities and consumer rights litigation firm, is investigating whether certain directors and officers of Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (“Yangtze” or the “Company”) (YRIV) breached their fiduciary duties to Yangtze and its shareholders. If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may contact attorney Joe Pettigrew for additional information: 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

Scott+Scott is investigating whether members of Yangtze’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts, about Yangtze’s business, operations, prospects, and financial health. Specifically, Scott+Scott is investigating whether the Board failed to disclose material information, including whether: (1) Yangtze’s purported lease of Wuhan Newport, the Company’s main asset, was a fabrication; (2) Yangtze’s only operating subsidiary, Wuhan Newport, was declared insolvent in China due to a number of default judgments against it; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

On August 27, 2018, Barron’s published, “A Troubled Chinese Company Is Seeking a Lifeline From U.S. Investors,” revealing that Wuhan Newport was “showing up on official websites in which Chinese courts list debtors with unpaid legal judgments.” On this news, Yangtze stock fell $0.11 per share, or almost 1%, to close at $11.53 on August 27, 2018.

On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report, entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated,” which caused Yangtze stock to fall $3.34 per share – over 28% – over the next two trading days to close at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

What You Can Do

If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may have legal claims against Yangtze’s directors and officers. If you wish to discuss this investigation, or have questions about this notice or your legal rights, please contact attorney Joe Pettigrew toll-free at 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

LD Micro has always held the belief that our industry needs a truly accurate indicator of what is occurring in the micro-cap world.

With this reconstitution the index will contain 984 companies, a surprisingly similar number to what we had back in February. Nearly as many companies have “graduated” out of the index as those that have “graduated” in.

Performance since the close of January 31st, 2019:

Nasdaq: +12% (Very nice)

S&P500: +10.2% (Solid)

Dow Jones: +7.5% (Respectable)

Russell 2000: +5% (Better than CDs)

LD Micro Index: -2.8% (The night is still young)

A breakdown by exchange, sector, and complete constituent list is available at our website: http://www.ldmicro.com/the-index.

Chris Lahiji, President of LD Micro, stated ""As we turn four, more people in our industry are using the Index as an additional indicator for what is taking place on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Our goal has always been to add much needed insight to the space, and based on the dichotomy between micro, small, and large-cap, we feel our index provides the most accurate picture of micro-cap as a whole. As evidenced, micro-cap performance thus far in 2019 has been incredibly disconcerting.”

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. Given the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and the Company’s pending Chapter 11 cases, the Company does not plan to appeal the Nasdaq determination to delist the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, trading of the Company’s common stock and warrants will be suspended at the opening of business on September 24, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company expects the common stock and warrants to be traded over-the-counter under the symbol “AMRQ” and “AMRWWQ” and expects to continue filing its annual, quarterly and current reports in accordance with the requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

The notification also stated that the Company would be provided 180 calendar days, or until February 11, 2020, to regain compliance with the foregoing listing requirement. To do so, the bid price of the Company's common stock must close at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to that date.

If the Company does not regain compliance by the compliance deadline, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to remedy the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq staff will inform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the Nasdaq staff that the Company will not be able to remedy the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, the staff will provide notice that its securities will be subject to delisting. The Company cannot provide any assurance that its common shares will trade at levels necessary to regain and maintain compliance with the above-referenced bid price rule before the compliance deadline. The Company intends to continue to monitor the bid price for its common stock. If the Company's common shares do not trade at a level that is likely to regain compliance with the Nasdaq requirements, the Company's Board of Directors will consider alternative options that may be available to achieve compliance.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced in a recent Form 6-K report that on September 4, 2019, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company stating that The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market.



The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting. Additionally, as of the date of this release, the Company continues to make progress with the completion of its delinquent annual report and intends to file these reports with the SEC. The Company intends to complete and file its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as soon as possible with the SEC. Thereafter, the Company intends to work with a market maker to file a Form 211 with FINRA to enable the Company’s shares to begin trading on the over-the-counter markets.

“While there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to execute its plan. If the shares resume trading on the over-the-counter markets, the shares may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on Nasdaq. While trading on the over-the-counter-markets the Company expects to apply for a Nasdaq listing at a future time.” concluded Mr. Liu.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced that a special committee comprised of independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”) has concluded the fact-finding portion of an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Song Wang (“Mr. Wang”), and allegations of enterprise bribery involving the Company that date back to 2014.



The Special Committee retained the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP to assist in conducting this investigation. While the Special Committee identified potential concerns relating to certain Company transactions that may indicate that improper payments were made in connection with the 2014 transaction at issue, it did not identify direct evidence indicating that Mr. Wang or any member of Company Management or the Board of Directors (the “Board”) engaged in or approved of any improper payment. It should be noted that the Special Committee’s investigation was constrained to some extent by the passage of time, significant turnover in Company personnel since 2014 and the lack of direct access to Mr. Wang. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Committee did identify weaknesses in the Company’s compliance program and recommended several improvements, including the addition of resources for compliance and internal audit functions and enhanced training. The Board has approved the adoption of all of these recommendations and the Company has begun implementing them.

The Board also accepted the resignation of two senior managers (including one who was also a director of the Company), who did not notify the Board of the arrest of Mr. Wang until May 16, 2019. It is the understanding of the Special Committee that during the absence of Mr. Wang, from around January 16, 2019 until May 16, 2019, the Company’s operations were managed by other members of the Company’s management team, including a member thereof who exercised certain management authority under power of attorney granted by Mr. Wang prior to his detention.

To enhance its commitment to stringent corporate governance standards, the Board was recently reconstituted by appointing three new directors. The reconstituted Board consists of two independent directors and two executive directors. The Chairman of the Board and all members of the audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance committees are independent. In addition, the management of the Company is currently led by Mr. Bin Liu, the acting chief executive officer, who was appointed to replace Mr. Wang on May 17, 2019. The Company intends to add a third independent director to the Board in the near term to ensure that there are three independent directors on the audit committee and that a majority of the directors on the Board are independent, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules.

L Catterton Enters Into Definitive Agreement to Sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille to Landry's, Inc.

IRVING, Texas and GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Del Frisco's"") and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced the completion of the transaction under which L Catterton has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Del Frisco's for approximately $650 million. As a result of the transaction's close, Del Frisco's stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In conjunction with closing, L Catterton has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille assets to Landry's, Inc. (""Landry's"") for an undisclosed consideration. The transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""We are confident that the separation of the business and the sale of the steak concepts to Landry's creates the best opportunity to unlock value in all of the Company's restaurant brands,"" said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. ""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Mr. Taub added, ""We look forward to leveraging L Catterton's deep restaurant experience and operational capabilities to help bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar reach their full potential. We are confident that running as separate businesses, these highly experiential and unique restaurant concepts will be best positioned for growth and expansion.""

bartaco

bartaco combines fresh, upscale street food with a coastal vibe in a relaxed environment. With 22 restaurants in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, bartaco is recognized as a local neighborhood favorite for outdoor dining, date night, and the best tacos and margaritas by both national and regional outlets.

Today, Barcelona Wine Bar has 17 locations in Colorado, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., each with its own vibrant energy.

Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille

Landry's, which operates more than 500 high-end and casual dining establishments around the world, including well-known steak concepts Morton's The Steakhouse, Mastro's Restaurants and Strip House, is well-positioned to own the Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille restaurants and maintain their leadership position in the industry.

L Catterton was advised by Credit Suisse, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

IRVING, Texas, June 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions. Engaged Capital and certain of its affiliates, collectively holding nearly 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, have entered into voting agreements committing them to, among other things and subject to its terms, vote in favor of adopting the acquisition agreement.

“Over the course of our review, the Committee evaluated a full range of strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives to best serve the interests of our stockholders. After a thorough process, including considering Del Frisco’s current operations and future prospects, the Committee and the Board is confident that this transaction offers the most promising opportunity to realize the highest value for our stockholders,” said Joe Reece, Committee Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“In consultation with our outside advisors, the Board has been evaluating several strategic and financial alternative options since December 2018. This transaction offers immediate liquidity at a significant premium for our stockholders while providing the best path forward for our Del Frisco’s brands, our employees, and loyal guests,” said Ian R. Carter, Board Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“L Catterton brings a distinguished track record of fostering the growth and success of world class experiential brands. Together with their deep operational expertise in the restaurant industry, I am confident L Catterton will be a great long-term partner,” said Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

Del Frisco’s comprises four leading brands across two distinct business lines -- Del Frisco’s Grille and Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in the steak and grill category, and bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar in the upscale regionally-inspired cuisine category. Upon the close of the transaction, L Catterton plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar businesses separately from the steakhouse brands in order to nurture the unique attributes of the brands.

“At L Catterton, we bring more than just capital – we bring significant operational expertise to our investments,” said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. “Over the last 30 years, L Catterton has invested in nearly 30 restaurant concepts globally to create a number of industry leaders. Del Frisco’s has four outstanding brands in two distinct and attractive categories – upscale regionally-inspired cuisine, and steak and grill. We’re excited to partner with the Company to harness the power of these brands by operating the upscale regionally-inspired brands separately from the steak and grill concepts.”

L Catterton has invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin' Brands Inc. (including Outback Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill), CÉ LA VI, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Crystal Jade, Culinary Concepts by Jean-Georges, P.F.

The billionaire owner of casinos, restaurants and the NBA’s Houston Rockets had coveted Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group Inc. since 2012. This summer it looked improbable that his Landry’s Inc. restaurant group would get a shot. Private equity firm L Catterton had struck a deal to acquire the high-end chain in June and, as recently as Tuesday, bankers were busy trying to sell debt to fund the transaction.

But, in a surprise twist, Fertitta popped up to snare the coveted steakhouses.

L Catterton completed its $650 million purchase Wednesday, but immediately announced it was selling Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouses and Del Frisco’s Grilles to Landry’s for an undisclosed sum. The buyout firm will keep bartaco, a purveyor of tacos and tequila, and Barcelona Wine Bar brands.

“It’s something that I’ve looked at for years and sometimes you just have to wait for the deal to come back to you,” Fertitta, 62, said in a phone interview.

Del Frisco’s operates more than 35 restaurants, including Del Frisco’s Double Eagle in Midtown Manhattan, a favorite with the finance crowd, offering its signature 45-day dry-aged double-bone prime ribeye for $140 and a tasting of three wagyu steaks at $205.

It also has locations in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, and one in Washington that caters to lobbyists and politicians. On the night of the deal, a sign indicated that Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was there.

Despite the chain’s popularity with Wall Street, bankers labored to sell $425 million of debt to fund L Catterton’s buyout. Credit Suisse Group AG offered an all-in yield of 9.6%, people familiar with the matter said this month. But with concerns growing about the effects a potential recession may have on a cyclical business, especially expensive steakhouses and wine bars, some investors remained skeptical.

A spokeswoman for L Catterton declined to comment.

Fertitta, who’s worth $3.9 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, also said he couldn’t comment on why L Catterton sold the assets, but he’s a big believer in steak.

The Houston businessman already owns nine steakhouse chains, including Morton’s and Mastro’s. He even opened a female-focused one with actress Eva Longoria in 2013 that’s now closed. Fertitta said he’s willing to put more equity into the Del Frisco’s business and isn’t concerned about the long-term prospects, including the threat from meat substitutes.

“I’ll do whatever I need to do,” said Fertitta, who’s also the chairman and chief executive officer of Fertitta Entertainment, which operates the Golden Nugget casinos. “Steak’s always gonna be the most popular food in the world.”

Fertitta may see a challenge from meat substitutes as consumers flock to restaurants for plant-based burgers from Beyond Meat Inc. and Impossible Foods Inc. Fertitta said the hype of meatless burgers is overblown and that consumers will return to red meat once they realize the products aren’t as healthy as they’re made out to be.

Still, he’s open to serving the trendy plant-based product “if the customers want them,” he said.

Fertitta, who counts Jefferies Financial Group Inc. head Richard Handler as a close friend, used the bank as Landry’s lead adviser on the deal, along with Deutsche Bank Securities and North Point Advisors.

TORRANCE, Calif., Sept. 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants.

Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies include constipation, nausea, headache, and abdominal pain.

Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation included one case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash.

The safety and efficacy of Endari in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease younger than five years of age has not been established.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment, today released the following summary review of the clinical trials and efficacy findings for Endari®.

""In light of our decision to withdraw our marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine), there is some confusion relating to the previous clinical trials and efficacy findings that led to Endari's approval by the FDA in 2017,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following summary to our shareholders and the SCD community.""

Endari Clinical Trial Results

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

https://www.emmausmedical.com/content/ceoletters/ceo-letter-sep-10-2019-193

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

XLRN announced the discontinuation of a phase II study evaluating its pipeline candidate, ACE-083, in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Although the candidate achieved growth in muscle volume in FSHD patients, it failed to deliver a meaningful functional benefit on top of it.

Data from the study showed that ACE-083 achieved statistically significant increase in mean total muscle volume, the study’s primary endpoint. However, the company announced that the increase in muscle volume failed to translate into improvements in functional tests of statistical significance, representing secondary endpoints. This failure resulted in the company’s decision to discontinue further development of the candidate in FSHD patients.

So far this year, Acceleron stock has gained 2.7% against the industry’s decline of 1.2%.

Meanwhile, the company continues to develop ACE-083 as a treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, another neuromuscular disorder in a phase II study. Top-line data from this study is expected in the first quarter of 2020.

We note that the company had discontinued development of another pipeline candidate, ACE-2494 in April. The candidate was being developed in a phase I study as a potential treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Higher frequency of anti-drug antibodies generation was observed in patients, which was the primary reason behind the discontinuation of its development.

Acceleron is developing its lead pipeline candidate, luspatercept, in collaboration with Celgene CELG for the treatment of chronic anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes, beta-thalassemia and myelofibrosis.

Two regulatory applications seeking approval for the candidate as a treatment for beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes associated anemia are under review with the FDA.

Currently, the company is also developing sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”), a rare disease with high unmet medical need. The FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to sotatercept for PAH earlier this month.

In June, Acceleron completed enrolling patients in the PULSAR study and plans to report top-line data from the same in the first quarter of 2020. Also, the company is currently recruiting subjects in the SPECTRA exploratory study to have a better understanding of sotatercept's potential impact on PAH. Preliminary results from this study are expected in 2020.

The acquisition of Finisar was first announced on November 9, 2018.



Under the terms of the merger agreement, Finisar shareholders will receive on average $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI common stock per 1.0 share of Finisar common stock depending on each shareholder’s election as laid out in the merger agreement. This transaction is fully taxable to Finisar shareholders. The company expects to achieve $150M in run rate synergies over the next three years. The financing for the transaction was $1.9B of cash raised in a combination of Term Loans A and B with a combined interest rate of L+251 and $1.1B of the company’s stock.

The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $22.33 to $23.29 in the past one-month time frame.

The company has seen three negative estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few weeks, suggesting there may be trouble down the road. So, make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.

Finisar currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is negative.

Finisar will demonstrate the latest form factors, laser technology, and test equipment for high-speed connections in hyperscale data centers, 5G wireless networks, and optical test systems. See these demonstrations and more in Finisar's booth 62 at the RDS Venue in Dublin, September 23-25.

400GBASE-SR4.2 QSFP-DD transceivers for high-speed data centers

Finisar and Foxconn Interconnect Technology are showcasing the industry's first interoperability demonstration of 400G SR4.2 QSFP-DD optical transceivers at the Finisar booth. These IEEE-compliant transceivers use eight fibers and an MPO-12 optical connector which provide a low total cost solution for 400G data rate upgrades using the installed base of multimode cabling deployed for 100G SR4 in data centers today. The IEEE P802.3cm task force has made a baseline proposal for 400GBASE-SR4.2 which includes support for up to 70m on OM3 and 100m on OM4 multimode fiber, aligned with the 400G BiDi MSA. This is the second short-reach 400G multimode transceiver announced by Finisar, following the 400G SR8 OSFP module demonstrated at OFC earlier this year.

100G PAM4 VCSEL technology for hyperscale data centers

Finisar is unveiling the industry's first public technology demonstration of a multimode VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) transmitting at 100G data rates using PAM4 modulation. This technology demonstration is a critical milestone towards product developments that can enable 800G short-reach optical modules and active optical cables (AOCs) needed for next-generation hyperscale data centers. Traditionally, multimode transceivers and AOCs that utilize VCSEL technology have offered the lowest cost for short-reach interconnect applications, a trend that is expected to continue with 800G+ products that are based on 100G PAM4 per lane. Attendees will be able to observe the optical performance of the prototype VCSEL’s over multimode fiber using a high-speed scope.

5G Wireless Front-haul Ecosystem featuring Tunable SFP28 transceivers

Finisar is showcasing various optical transceiver modules for 5G wireless front-haul networks. Driven by the anticipation of very large volume deployments, wireless front-haul applications will require cost-efficient high data rate solutions. Such applications in 5G networks are expected to require primarily 25G data rates, and Finisar is already offering several products covering 300m, 2km and 10km reaches. For 10km, Finisar provides both duplex and bidirectional transceiver solutions to help customers with optical fiber constraints. For C-RAN applications, Finisar is demonstrating LAN-WDM and O-band CWDM solutions, which enable more efficient wireless front haul networks with a minimum number of optical fibers.

As part of its 5G product offering, Finisar is also demonstrating full C-band DWDM wavelength tunable SFP28 modules operating at 25Gb/s over 15km of single mode fiber. These transceivers provide significant advantages over fixed wavelength solutions for carriers upgrading their networks to the latest wireless standards. Leveraging DWDM technology allows more efficient use of the limited installed fiber in the front-haul network. Finisar’s market-leading wavelength tunable SFP28 transceivers also provide operational efficiencies and savings over fixed wavelength products. These products will be available with Finisar’s patented Flextune™ wavelength self-tuning functionality.

WaveAnalyzer 1500S High Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer

The WaveAnalyzer™ 1500S demonstrates high speed and high-resolution measurements on optical signals in the L-band of telecommunications, including OSNR and WDM analysis. This instrument has been designed to support developers of next-generation optical systems. In addition, the WaveAnalyzer 200A Portable Optical Spectrum Analyzer will demonstrate spectral measurements in a compact, portable, battery operated platform. This instrument supports trouble shooting in Data Center Interconnects as well as mobile measurements in a lab environment.

Establishing the date of the Election Deadline is not intended, however, to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (“SAMR”).



To make an election, all Finisar stockholders who have not previously made their cash, stock, or mixed consideration elections, or who desire to revoke a prior election and make a new election, must submit their properly completed and signed election forms with respect to their shares, together with all required documents and materials set forth in the election form and the instructions thereto, to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), the exchange agent for the Merger, by the Election Deadline. Finisar stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may be subject to an earlier deadline and should read carefully the instructions from their bank, broker or nominee regarding making elections for their shares. Finisar stockholders with questions should contact AST at (877) 248-6417 or (718) 921-8317.

In accordance with the previously announced merger agreement, Finisar stockholders may elect to receive either $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration”), 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI, no par value (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Election Consideration”), or a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Election Consideration”). Finisar stockholders may also choose to make no election with respect to their shares, and will be deemed to have made no election with respect to their shares if they fail to make an election, revoke a prior election without making a new election, or their election materials are not received in proper form by AST prior to the Election Deadline, in which case such stockholders will receive the Mixed Election Consideration. The Cash Election Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration are subject to automatic proration adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement such that the aggregate merger consideration paid to all Finisar stockholders as a group will consist of approximately 60% cash and 40% II-VI Common Stock (assuming a II-VI Common Stock per share price equal to the closing price as of November 8, 2018), as further described in the merger agreement and the joint proxy statement/prospectus provided to Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders in connection with the special meeting of Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders, each of which was held on March 26, 2019.

Under the terms of the merger agreement for the Merger, the deadline for Finisar stockholders to submit their elections is to be 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the date which the parties to the merger agreement agree is as near as practicable to two business days prior to the closing date of the Merger. The Election Deadline has been chosen by II-VI and Finisar in accordance with the merger agreement in order to provide sufficient notice to enable Finisar stockholders to elect their preferred form of merger consideration, while still enabling the parties to consummate the Merger within two business days following the satisfaction of the various conditions to the Merger. The date selected for the Election Deadline does not, however, in any way guarantee or indicate that the Merger will actually close two business days after the Election Deadline, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or certainty of the closing of the Merger. The date of the Election Deadline also is not intended to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by SAMR, and the parties continue to anticipate that SAMR’s approval of the Merger will be received mid calendar year 2019. It is possible, however, that factors outside the control of the parties could result in SAMR’s approval being received at a different time or not at all. II-VI and Finisar reserve the right to set a revised election deadline.

This compares to earnings of $0.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.55%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering no surprise.

Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.

Gladstone Capital, which belongs to the Zacks Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry industry, posted revenues of $12.52 million for the quarter ended March 2019, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.64%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.09 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Gladstone Capital shares have added about 30.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.5%.

What's Next for Gladstone Capital?

While Gladstone Capital has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gladstone Capital was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.22 on $12.51 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.86 on $49.91 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry is currently in the bottom 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Loan investors expect commitments due on at least 10 deals for $6 billion, while the pipeline is thin for junk-rated issuance. Investment-grade borrowers may sell about $15 billion of bonds.

The syndication of loans and a high-yield bond to finance Apollo Global Management Inc.’s buyout of online retailer Shutterfly are expected to continue this week after failing to sell following investor pushback on price and terms. Commitments on the reworked debt sale were due Friday after banks had to fund the LBO, which closed before the loans and bonds could price after negotiations with investors dragged out.

Loans with commitments this week include technology solutions provider CDW’s $1.45 billion refinancing loan, Guidehouse’s $640 million of debt to help finance its planned acquisition of Navigant Consulting Inc. and Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc.’s $440 million loan. Meanwhile, Merlin Entertainments may launch a jumbo cross-border deal as soon as this week. The buyout loan may include about $592 million in U.S. dollar term loans as well as a U.S. dollar bridge facility.

Borrowers have launched loans worth about $50 billion so far this month, making September the biggest month for new deals in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Several companies including Shutterfly struggled to attract demand last week as investors forced some issuers to hike yields and sweeten terms.

Some junk-rated borrowers may hold off on plans to issue new debt this week to give investors time to digest the recent deluge of new bonds. Supply is favorable for money managers despite issuance remaining light, with net sales currently at negative $3.2 billion year-to-date, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. About $49 billion of bonds have left the junk market as companies got upgraded to investment-grade, which more than offset the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance that added to junk volume, according to the bank.

“More than 72% of this year’s gross issuance has been associated with debt repayment and/or refinancing,” Goldman Sachs credit analysts led by Lofti Karoui wrote in a report last week. “As a result, a portion of the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance likely includes maturities that have been ‘pre-funded’ but have not yet reached their call (or maturity) date, resulting in an artificially inflated net supply figure (until those maturities formally roll off).”

In the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market, dealers are projecting as much as $15 billion in new supply over the five days. A record 127 issuers have taken advantage of the current low interest rates and heightened investor demand to borrow over $154 billion for debt refinancing in September.

“If rates stay here I think supply will be heavy going into the end of the year,” Scott Colyer, chairman and chief executive officer at Advisors Asset Management Inc., said in an interview. “Because the absolute cost of borrowing is so low, companies will think of borrowing and with rates this cheap, M&A and share buyback look pretty good.”

In the distressed world, bondholders will be keeping a close eye on debt payments due Monday, including from Intelsat SA, Mallinckrodt Plc, Iconix Brand Group Inc., Jason Industries Inc. and Ultra Petroleum Corp.

Credit investors will also be watching for potential market volatility that may be sparked by the repurchase agreements market. The Federal Reserve is gearing up for the third quarter, with $100 billion overnight repo operations expected to be repeated Monday.

“Spreads are narrow, there’s plenty of liquidity so at this point in time, the credit markets are just fine, operating as they should,” said Colyer. “As we get closer to the end of the cycle, we have started to move up the credits quality scale.”

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

Marks 20th Anniversary of ePort Debut with “Powering Your Unattended World” Themed Booth; Showcases Cutting-Edge Technologies, Partnerships and New Research

The NAMA Show - Today, USA Technologies (USAT) (“USAT”), a premier digital payment, consumer engagement and logistics service provider for the self-service retail market, marked the 20th anniversary of the debut of the ePort which was first unveiled at NAMA in 1999, bringing one of the first cashless payment platforms to the self-serve retail industry. With an eye toward USAT’s continued leadership in innovation, USAT branded its booth, “Powering Your Unattended World,” and showcased new technologies, partnerships and research throughout the show.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190426005366/en/

“Twenty years ago, we ushered in the era of cashless in the vending market with ePort Connect,” said Stephen P. Herbert, CEO of USA Technologies. “Since then, USAT has been at the helm of industry innovation, a change agent powering cashless adoption industry-wide. Early on, we began to recognize the benefits and opportunities possible through cashless technologies. USAT has since grown to support over 15,000 customers and approximately one million connections. We believe we have one of the largest NFC mobile footprints in the US retail market. We were excited to celebrate this incredible accomplishment at NAMA and look forward to continuing to drive innovation and shape the self-serve retail marketplace for decades to come.”

During the show, USAT’s booth focused on the strength of its enterprise platform for unattended retail through its booth design and messaging: bringing consumer engagement and rewards, the benefits of both top-line revenue opportunities through digital payments and the bottom-line margin opportunities through increased efficiencies, logistics and merchandising.

Seed Markets Expansion: USAT announced that Seed Markets is now fully integrated with some of the industry’s large micro market providers, including 365 Retail Markets, Avanti Markets, Company Kitchen, Three Square Market and Yoke Payments. Through the Seed Markets’ cloud-based and mobile solution, micro market operators can now benefit from one standard set of tools including simplified route management, efficient warehouse pre-picking, a single reporting interface and cash accountability. Seed Markets was also featured in NAMA’s New Product Zone.

Apple Pay Cash Study: In its main booth, USAT highlighted a rewards program promoting Apple Pay Cash where a consumer can receive a discount if they use Apple Pay Cash at a participating ePort location.

Michigan State University Study on Low Performing Machines: While many vending operators prioritize equipping high-volume machines with cashless technology, USAT’s study in partnership with Michigan State University found that low performing machines can offer significant revenue growth as well. Vending operators who added cashless technology to machines with less than $2,000 a year in sales experienced top line sales growth of 110 percent on average over the first 18 months following deployment, and cash sales increased by an average of 97 percent on the low performing machines during that same period. The results were presented on the show floor on Thursday, April 25th during NAMA Learning Lab and the full press release announcing the results can be found here.

Partnerships in Action: In its Partner Pavilion, USAT showcased its technology in real life scenarios such as in workplace break rooms, the airport and more, with various industry partners across the vending, micro-market and office coffee services segments. Participating partners include 365 markets, ShelfX, and Bunn. Starbucks and Avanti Markets are also showcasing USAT’s technology in their booths.

“USA Technologies has been a great partner,” said Karalynn McDermott, Senior Vice President of Market Development at Bunn-O-Matic Corporation. “The support and reliability we receive from USA Technologies, as well as their proven system, allows us to grow and innovate. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the company as the convenience service industry continues to grow.”

“Imperial has been a Seed customer for more than 10 years, and it has completely revolutionized our business,” said Lance Whorton President of Imperial Companies. “Through USAT’s Seed technology, we can now ensure our machines are full, our routes are growing and our products are targeted to the preferences of consumers. This ensures we are bringing a better experience to our clients and consumers while increasing our top line sales which continue to grow year-over-year-over-year.”

The NAMA show ran from April 24-26 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, NV.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), in addition to such initial grace period, the Company could be afforded an additional 180-calendar day compliance period, provided that on the 180th calendar day of the initial grace period, the Company (i) met the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement) and (ii) notified NASDAQ of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency.

Additionally, in a press release issued on May 9, 2019, it was announced that on May 6, 2019 the Company received a letter (the ""Failure to File Notice"") from NASDAQ stating that, because it had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the ""Form 20-F""), it was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Failure to File Notice stated that the Company had until May 20, 2019 to submit to NASDAQ a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In setting the May 20, 2019 deadline for submitting a plan of compliance, the NASDAQ Staff determined to apply more stringent criteria and shorten the normal time period for the Company to submit its plan. The Failure to File Notice stated that if NASDAQ accepted the Company's plan, then NASDAQ could grant the Company up to 180 days from the prescribed due date for filing the Form 20-F to regain compliance.

On May 20, 2019, the Company submitted its plan for compliance for filing the delinquent Form 20-F in which it undertook to file the Form 20-F by July 31, 2019.

On July 10, 2019, the Company received a letter (the ""Delisting Notice"") from NASDAQ advising the Company that its Staff had determined to deny the Company's request for an extension of time to file its Annual Report on Form 20-­F for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to delist the Company's Common Shares for failing to comply with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In addition, the Delisting Notice stated that conflicting public disclosures in the Company's SEC reports had created a lack of clarity regarding the composition of its Board of Directors, as well as its executive management, raising significant concerns regarding the governance of the Company, which the Staff believed constituted a separate and discrete basis for delisting in the exercise of the discretionary authority granted to the Staff by Listing Rule 5101. Listing Rule 5101 states, in part, that NASDAQ ""...has broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities in NASDAQ in order to maintain the quality of and public confidence in its market, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. NASDAQ may use such discretion to deny initial listing, apply additional or more stringent criteria for the initial or continued listing of particular securities, or suspend or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs that makes initial or continued listing of the securities on NASDAQ inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of NASDAQ, even though the securities meet all enumerated criteria for initial or continued listing on NASDAQ.""

The Notice stated that unless the Company requested an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist its Common Shares, trading of the Common Shares will be suspended at the opening of business on July 19, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Company intends to request a hearing with a Hearings Panel at NASDAQ to appeal the delisting determination and to request a stay of the trading suspension pending the outcome of the hearing. In addition, the Company will submit a plan of compliance to regain compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing of the Company's Common Shares with its request for a hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with such requirements.

The Delisting Determination stated that unless the Company requests an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist the Company's ADSs, trading of the ADSs will be suspended at the opening of business on September 17, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on the Nasdaq. After due deliberation, the Company does not intend to appeal the Delisting Determination by requesting a hearing before a hearings panel. After the Company is delisted from the Nasdaq, its ADSs may be traded over-the-counter on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the ""pink sheets"" if one or more market makers seeks and obtains approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to continue quoting in the Company's ADSs. Many over-the-counter stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the Nasdaq, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of the Company's ADSs.

This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a Staff delisting determination.

It has resulted from the fact that the bid price of the Company's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") closed below US$1 per share for the last 30 consecutive business days. The Company has a grace period of 180 calendar days, expiring on December 9, 2019, in which to regain compliance.

This research evaluates key technologies involved in digital transformation including 5G, AI, Big Data Analytics, Blockchain, Cloud and Mobile Edge Computing, Connected and Wearable Devices, Cybersecurity, Digital Twins and Teleoperation, IoT, Robotics, Smart Cities, and Virtual Reality solutions.

These technologies will all be germane to the evolution of many areas important to enterprise and industrial organizations including internal and external processes, products and services, virtualization, OSS/BSS, and more.

The enterprise and industrial sectors are rapidly digitizing their products and services including software-controlled and virtualized infrastructure as well as leveraging next-generation connectivity, signaling, and automated decision-making algorithms. This will have a profound effect on both overall strategic positioning and day to day tactical operations. New technologies and tools being rapidly integrated into production and service systems, which are facilitating the transformation of processes, creating new business opportunities, and enabling an overall smarter workplace for humans and machines alike.



Telecom infrastructure and services providers are also undergoing a massive transformation. For example, the combination of 5G and edge computing will transform wireless carrier operations and facilitate enhanced services, new applications, and completely new business models for mobile network operators. In addition, software-defined control and infrastructure virtualization are poised to transform network and service architecture thanks to improvements in technologies that offer improved performance and lower costs. As the border between cloud computing and network infrastructure continues to blur, so does the demarcation between the network as a whole and those network elements (servers, terminals, etc.) that comprise the network.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms enhance the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The combination of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to dramatically accelerate the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The author sees the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) as transformational for both technologies as AI adds value to IoT through machine learning and decision making and IoT adds value to AI through connectivity and data exchange.



AIoT solutions dramatically accelerating the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective smart city solutions in terms of decision making. 5G provides substantial bandwidth where needed as well as significantly lower latency for next-generation applications and services such as virtual reality controlled teleoperation and other enhanced user interfaces.



We see smart cities providing significant opportunities for technology integration in support of highly customized, yet scalable services. There will be a positive feedback loop created and sustained by leveraging the interdependent capabilities of AI, IoT, and 5G (AIoT5G). For example, AI will work in conjunction with IoT to substantially improve smart city supply chains. Metropolitan area supply chains represent complex systems of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer.



The Industrial IoT (IIoT) market is much more than the sum of its parts, but its parts alone can be daunting, especially considering how emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and modified reality is being rapidly integrated into industrial processes. AI alone is anticipated to dramatically reduce costs and improve processes as well as facilitate completely new products and services that improve production, quality, and the producer-supplier relationship.



This is the most comprehensive research available anywhere that evaluates each of these technologies and assesses their convergence and integration opportunities. The research provides a wide-ranging view into the ecosystem including companies, strategies, and solutions for each technical domain as well as cross-domain implementation and operations. The research provides detailed forecasts by application and service, use case, and industry vertical.

Market leading companies are rapidly integrated big data technologies with IoT infrastructure

The big data market consists of infrastructure providers, data centers, data as a service providers, and other vendors. Solutions for managing unstructured data are evolving beyond systems aligned towards primarily human-generated data (such as social networking, messaging, and browsing habits) towards increasingly greater emphasis upon machine-generated data found across many industry verticals.



For example, manufacturing and healthcare are anticipated to create massive amounts of data that may be rendered useful only through advanced analytics and various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as machine learning and cognitive computing. The long-term prospect for these technologies is that they will become embedded in many different other technologies and provide autonomous decision making on behalf of humans, both directly, and indirectly through many processes, products, and services.



Emerging networks and systems such as IoT and edge computing will generate substantial amounts of unstructured data, which will present both technical challenges and market opportunities for operating companies and their vendors. Emerging big data tools such as open APIs much be implemented to facilitate data capture and processing with the ability to perform localized processing and decision making.



Big data solution provider dynamics are evolving almost as much as the data management technologies themselves. While some companies rely upon proprietary solutions, many leading companies such as Hortonworks and Cloudera offer products and services primarily based on open source Apache Hadoop technology. One important distinction between market leaders is collaboration vs. competition. For example, Cloudera competes with IBM, Microsoft, and others in data science and AI whereas Hortonworks partners with these companies.



In terms of data management and analytics technologies, the big data industry is experiencing profound changes across the entire stack including infrastructure, security, analytics, and the application layer. The data services industry as a whole is shifting from host-based network topologies to cloud-based, data-centric architectures, thereby creating enormous challenges and opportunities for transitioning and securing data systems. In concert with this shift, big data infrastructure will require strategic governance and framework for optimized security.



Advanced analytics provide the ability to make raw data meaningful and useful as information for decision-making purposes. AI enhances the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective decision making, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks.



The ability to capture streaming data, determine valuable attributes, and make decisions in real-time will add an entirely new dimension to service logic. In many cases, the data itself, and actionable information will be the service. However, real-time data is anticipated to become a highly valuable aspect of all solutions as a determinant of user behavior, application effectiveness, and an identifier of new and enhanced mobile/wireless and/or IoT related apps and services.



Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) are perhaps best known as data-intensive immersive technologies that require high bandwidth for operations. One of the least evaluated opportunities is the market opportunities associated with visualizing data and information in AR, VR, and MR environments. Much of this data will be unstructured, requiring big data analytics tools to process, categorize, and display in a meaningful manner. This will allow the end user to visualize and utilize information in ways previously inconceivable.



In addition, leading data management companies are developing tools for improved general data visualization, facilitating improved information interpretation and decision making. Coupled with AI and cognitive computing, the field of advanced data visualization and analytics known as augmented analytics is transforming otherwise useless data into highly valuable and actionable smart data, often enabling dynamic decision making that may positively impact business operations as processes, transactions, and other events occur. Much of this smart data will be monetized in a data as a service approach by enterprise thanks to leading big data service provider solutions.



Additional topics covered in this report include:

Market Analysis and Forecasts: Global and regional assessment of the market size and forecasts for 2019 to 2024

This report also includes analysis and forecasts for streaming data analytics. IoT facilitates vast amounts of fast-moving data from sensors and devices. For many use cases, data flows constantly from the device or sensor to the network and sometimes back to the device. In some cases, these streams of data are simply stored (for potential later use) and in other cases, there is a need for real-time data processing and analytics.

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants. As a result, Emmaus common stock and warrants will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market at the start of trading on Wednesday, September 11, 2019. It is expected that the company's common stock and warrants will be eligible for quotation on the OTC market after that date.

As previously disclosed, on July 19, 2019, Emmaus received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that the company was not compliant with the $5 million minimum stockholders' equity requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).

In its letter to Emmaus, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel recognized that the company is doing important work and expressed its hope that Emmaus securities may again trade on Nasdaq once the company meets Nasdaq's initial listing standards. Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

Recent company highlights include:

Reported sharply improved 2019 second quarter results, with net revenues up 128% year-over-year to $5.9 million from $2.6 million , as the company continues to commercialize its sickle cell disease drug.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications. We will continue to focus on our mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies.""

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

Operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was reduced to $1.2 million, versus $7.2 million last year.

As previously disclosed, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI were converted into shares of EMI common stock and cancelled in the merger in exchange for Emmaus shares, with a resulting increase in stockholders' equity. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock at a current conversion price of $9.52, subject to possible future adjustments.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children are born with sickle cell disease.

Taps SB360 As Exclusive Consultant To Conduct Store Closing Sales In The Last Remaining 81 Fred's Stores,"BOSTON, Sept. 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fred's Inc., a discount value retailer, has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners as their exclusive consultant to conduct Store Closing Sales in all 81 remaining Fred's locations. SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

(NYSE: MTN) today announced it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Peak Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKIS) at a purchase price of $11.00 per share, subject to certain conditions, including regulatory review and Peak Resorts' shareholder approval.

Through the acquisition, Vail Resorts will add 17 U.S. ski areas to its network of world-class resorts. Located near major metropolitan areas, including New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Columbus, St. Louis, Kansas City and Louisville, the resorts include:

Mount Snow in Vermont

in Hunter Mountain in New York

in Attitash Mountain Resort , Wildcat Mountain and Crotched Mountain in New Hampshire

, and in Liberty Mountain Resort , Roundtop Mountain Resort , Whitetail Resort , Jack Frost and Big Boulder in Pennsylvania

, , , and in Alpine Valley , Boston Mills , Brandywine and Mad River Mountain in Ohio

, , and in Hidden Valley and Snow Creek in Missouri

and in Paoli Peaks in Indiana

""We are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to add such a powerful network of ski areas to our Company,"" said Rob Katz, chairman and chief executive officer of Vail Resorts. ""Peak Resorts' ski areas in the Northeast are a perfect complement to our existing resorts and together will provide a very compelling offering to our guests in New York and Boston. With this acquisition, we are also able to make a much stronger connection to guests in critical cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest and build on the success we have already seen with our strategy in Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit. The acquisition fully embodies our philosophy of Epic for Everyone, making skiing and riding more accessible to guests across the U.S. and around the world.""

""The ski areas within the Peak Resorts portfolio exemplify the spirit of our sport as well as our Company's mission to provide an Experience of a Lifetime to guests,"" Katz continued. ""We're thrilled to welcome the resorts and their employees into the Vail Resorts family and invest in their continued success.""

""Vail Resorts has a proven track record of celebrating the unique identity of its resorts, while continually investing in the guest and employee experience. For this reason, we are confident that our resorts and employees will continue to thrive within the Vail Resorts network,"" said Timothy Boyd, president and chief executive officer of Peak Resorts. ""We are very proud of our track record over the last two decades in building the breadth, quality and accessibility of our resorts. We are thrilled that our guests will now have access to some of the world's most renowned resorts.""

When the transaction closes, the 2019-20 Epic Pass, Epic Local Pass and Military Epic Pass will include unlimited and unrestricted access to the 17 Peak Resorts ski areas. Guests with an Epic Day Pass will also be able to access the new ski areas as a part of the total number of days purchased. For the 2019-20 season, Vail Resorts will honor and continue to sell all Peak Resorts pass products, and Peak Resorts' pass holders will have the option to upgrade to an Epic Pass or Epic Local Pass, following closing of the transaction.

Additional Transaction Details

The aggregate purchase price for all Peak Resorts common stock is estimated to be approximately $264 million (calculated on a treasury method basis), which Vail Resorts intends to finance through a combination of cash on hand, its existing revolver facility and an expansion of its existing credit facility. In addition, Vail Resorts will be assuming or refinancing Peak Resorts' outstanding debt.

The acquisition is expected to generate incremental annual EBITDA of approximately $60 million in Vail Resorts' fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, the first fiscal year with the full benefit of the synergies of the acquisition, with additional revenue upside in future years. Synergies are expected to come from additional revenue across the Vail Resorts network of resorts and cost reductions from the elimination of certain duplicative administrative functions and greater efficiencies brought by Vail Resorts' size and scale. Vail Resorts' annual ongoing capital expenditures are expected to increase by $10 million to support the addition of the Peak Resorts ski areas. After closing of the transaction, Vail Resorts plans to invest approximately $15 million over the next two years in one-time capital spending to elevate the guest experience at these resorts.

The transaction was approved by both companies' Boards of Directors, and the Peak Resorts Board of Directors also recommends that Peak Resorts' shareholders approve the transaction.

The transaction is expected to close this fall. The parties expect operations at all Peak Resorts ski areas to continue in the ordinary course of business. Upon closing, Vail Resorts plans to retain the vast majority of each resort's employees.

WeissLaw is investigating whether SKIS' Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the merger agreement. Notably, the Company recently announced record-breaking financial results. It reported revenue of $184.42 million for the year ended April 30, 2019, representing an increase of $52.76 million over the $131.66 million reported in the same period of the previous year. According to SKIS' President and CEO, ""[f]iscal 2019 was a record year for [SKIS] . . . Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%.""

Given these facts, WeissLaw is concentrating its investigation on whether the merger enhances SKIS' shareholder value. Specifically, WeissLaw is concerned whether SKIS' Board conducted a fair process in agreeing to the proposed merger, whether the proposed merger undervalues the Company, and whether all material information related to the proposed merger is fully and fairly disclosed.

(NASDAQ: TBRG) (""Thunder Bridge""), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Thunder Bridge will acquire REPAY and the combined company (the ""Company"") will continue as a publicly-listed company with an implied enterprise value at closing of approximately $653 million, based on current assumptions.

Upon the close of the transaction, the Company intends to change its name to Repay Holdings Corporation and is expected to continue to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market under a new ticker symbol. REPAY's management team, led by John Morris, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Shaler Alias, Co-Founder and President, and Tim Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, will continue to lead the Company. REPAY's existing majority equity holder, Corsair Capital, a leading private equity investor in the financial services industry, is expected to remain the Company's largest stockholder.

REPAY processed approximately $7 billion of payment volume in 2018 across diverse verticals, such as personal loans, automotive loans and receivables management. Management believes these verticals are underserved and accordingly provide significant growth opportunities over the next several years. The Company serves more than 3,000 clients via a proprietary, omni-channel payment platform that reduces complexity for merchants and enhances the consumer experience. In addition to highly-recurring revenue, REPAY has achieved strong Adjusted EBITDA growth over the last three years through market expansion, increased penetration of existing customers, new client wins and strategic acquisitions.

Gary Simanson, President and CEO of Thunder Bridge, said, ""REPAY has achieved impressive growth while also delivering high levels of profitability in an exciting and underpenetrated area of the payments sector. John Morris and his team have developed a technology platform that is well-positioned with over 50 software integration partnerships to service customers with a footprint representing more than 11,000 locations across the country.

Transaction Summary

The transaction reflects an implied enterprise value at closing of $653 million, based on current assumptions. The cash component of the purchase price to be paid to the equity holders of REPAY is expected to be funded by Thunder Bridge's cash in trust and debt financing, for which a commitment has been obtained. The balance of the consideration payable to the existing REPAY equity holders will consist of equity interests of the surviving subsidiary which will be exchangeable into shares of common stock of the Company at the option of such equity holders. Existing REPAY equity holders have the potential to receive an earnout of additional equity interests of the surviving subsidiary if certain stock price targets are met as set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Corsair Capital and the REPAY management team will remain investors by rolling over significant equity into the combined company.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Thunder Bridge will domesticate from a Cayman Islands exempted company to a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge will merge with and into Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC, with Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge. The corporate name of Thunder Bridge will change to Repay Holdings Corporation.

The transactions have been unanimously approved by the boards of both REPAY and Thunder Bridge. Completion of the transactions is subject to approval by the stockholders of Thunder Bridge and certain other conditions. The transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.

Additional information about the business combination will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will contain an investor presentation to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and available at www.sec.gov. In addition, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC.

Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

In addition to factors previously disclosed in Thunder Bridge's reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: inability to meet the closing conditions to the business combination, including the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of Thunder Bridge's shareholders, the inability to consummate the contemplated debt financing, the failure to achieve the minimum amount of cash available following any redemptions by Thunder Bridge shareholders or the failure to meet The Nasdaq Stock Market's listing standards in connection with the consummation of the contemplated transactions; costs related to the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement; a delay or failure to realize the expected benefits from the proposed transaction; risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; changes in the payment processing market in which REPAY competes, including with respect to its competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory changes; changes in the vertical markets that REPAY targets; risks relating to REPAY's relationships within the payment ecosystem; risk that REPAY may not be able to execute its growth strategies, including identifying and executing acquisitions; risks relating to data security; and risk that REPAY may not be able to develop and maintain effective internal controls.

Actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. All information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof in the case of information about Thunder Bridge and REPAY or the date of such information in the case of information from persons other than Thunder Bridge or REPAY, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this communication. Forecasts and estimates regarding REPAY's industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT

For additional information on the proposed transaction, see Thunder Bridge's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed concurrently. In connection with the proposed transaction, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. Before making any voting or investment decision, investors and stockholders of Thunder Bridge are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus, when they become available, and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. The documents filed by Thunder Bridge with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, or by directing a request to Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd., 9912 Georgetown Pike, Suite D203, Great Falls, Virginia 22066, Attention: Secretary, (202) 431-0507

PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION

Thunder Bridge and REPAY and certain of their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in favor of the approval of the business combination. Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed participants in the solicitation of the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in connection with the proposed business combination will be set forth in the registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a proxy statement/prospectus, when it becomes available. Information regarding Thunder Bridge's directors and executive officers are set forth in Thunder Bridge's Registration Statement on Form S-1, including amendments thereto, and other reports which are filed with the SEC. Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REPAY uses certain non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its business, measure its performance and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income prior to interest expense and depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to add back certain non-cash charges and account for non-recurring items, such as other expenses, non-cash gain from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction expenses, share-based compensation charges, and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP but instead considered alongside such measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in the industry may calculate it differently from how REPAY calculates it, reducing its overall usefulness. This communication does not provide a reconciliation of any forward-looking, estimated non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because calculating the components would involve numerous estimates and judgments that are unduly burdensome to prepare and may imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or potentially misleading to investors.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain.

""We feel as a company the best way to fight the short and distort strategy of our accuser is to operate and litigate. Our assets have been acquired and developed with real cash payments; and, the long term investment opportunity for profit leveraging our assets will ring true for our investors. This is a long and calculated battle with these short sellers, and we intend to fight with all of our capabilities using every resource available to us. We have a bright future as a member of the global economy and we look forward to the first steps on a long journey,"" said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

The impetus for the action was a false, misleading and defamatory unsigned article published on December 6, 2018 through one of the Defendants' aliases, ""Hindenburg Research,"" which erroneously accused Yangtze of making fraudulent misrepresentations in its public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") or intentionally omitting material information in those filings, laundering money through sham transactions for the benefit of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and being ensnared in a catastrophic liquidity crisis rendering the Company worthless.

As the Company's Complaint establishes with supporting evidence that was publicly filed with the SEC, the statements made in the Defendants' report are not only demonstrably false and misleading, but also nothing more than a ""short and distort"" attack on the Company for the financial gain of those Defendants, who concede in the Report that they ""are short YRIV"".

In the meantime, the Company has suffered a disastrous fallout from Defendants' coordinated attack, resulting in, among other things, reputational damage per se and monetary damages, which the Company seeks to redress through its lawsuit. The Company is confident that through this lawsuit, it will achieve the necessary legal recourse to compensate it for Defendants' wrongful actions and rehabilitate its reputation, enabling the Company to, once again, develop and continue to grow financially for the benefit of its shareholders.

On YRIV's latest quarterly balance sheet, the rights to the land are reported as having a value of $299 million, comprising over 77% of the company's total assets… Despite claiming to lease 1.2 million square meters from the village, our government-sourced maps…show that the total area of the village is only 610 thousand square meters. Moreover, conversations with officials from the village in question revealed that contrary to the company's claims, YRIV has not leased any land from them.""

The value of $299 million reflected in the Company's latest quarterly balance sheet is not related to the 1.2 million square meters of land. Instead, the reported value of $299 million relates to the value of land use rights of the unused portion of 6 parcels of commercial land (steel logistics park). Originally, the value of these land use rights of the 6 parcels of commercial land totaling 515,600 square meters, was booked at a cost of $308 million , of which 79,200 square meters of land have been used for constructing commercial buildings with 92,700 square meters of floor area, leaving 436,400 square meters of unused land. It is this unused piece of land that we have reported a value of $299 million . As of today, due to the significant appreciation of the local real estate market, we estimate that the 515,600 square meters of land that the Company has obtained land use right certificates for and was accounted at cost value, has nearly doubled to a value of nearly $600 million .

The Company's lease of 1.2 million square meters of land mentioned in the Report comprises land not only from the Chunfeng Village but also Junmin Village and Jiangdi Village, which were brokered and represented through Chunfeng Village.

2. Undisclosed Legal Judgments

A list of the 11 undisclosed legal judgments mentioned in the Report is set forth below:

Items 1-6 relate to the litigation and judgements arising from the sale of commercial house flats by the Company's subsidiary, Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd. (""Wuhan Newport""). These commercial house flats were sold in or before 2015. According to the relevant contracts of sale, if Wuhan Newport fails to develop the area in accordance with its original development plan within one year after the sale and purchase, Wuhan Newport would have to repurchase the commercial house flats at the original contracted price back from the purchasers. These proceedings were instituted by the purchasers before the said properties appreciated and doubled in value between 2017 and 2018. Consequently, the purchasers are now reluctant to enforce the judgments and sell back the properties to Wuhan Newport. The Company has already made provisions for the purchase of the properties in the financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Because the judgments were already rendered, the Company has not disclosed these judgements as ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Item 7 refers to the loan of RMB 290 million due to China Construction Bank Gangcheng Branch dated May 28, 2014 mentioned in the Report, plus interest totaling approximately RMB 325 million , and not in addition to such loan. The loan and interest payable obligations have been disclosed and accounted for in the Company's financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2017 .

The Company is in the process of negotiating a loan restructure with the bank and in the meantime, all payments due are suspended. Also, as a result of negotiations, the bank has not instituted enforcement proceedings. As in the above Items 1-6, because a judgement has already been rendered, the Company has not disclosed it as an ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Items 8-11 refer to judgements obtained against Wuhan Newport as a guarantor for certain loans taken out by a large shareholder of Wuhan Newport before it became a subsidiary of the Company. Since the judgments were rendered, the shareholder has undertaken in writing to be solely responsible for all these loans without recourse to Wuhan Newport and has entered into a repayment plan with his creditor(s). Accordingly, no enforcement actions have been instituted against Wuhan Newport and in accordance with legal opinion from PRC counsel, there are no legal or financial liability accorded to Wuhan Newport.

3. Money from YRIV's Capital Raises Has Been Used to Pay the Chairman/Controlling Shareholder Rather Than Advance Company's Projects

The Report alleges that the Company has consistently reported large liability balances ""due to related parties"" on its financial statements. These, in turn, seem to accrue large interest rates which simply get added to the ""advances"" over time. When capital is raised, cash is then used to pay back the supposed related-party ""advances"", rather than being employed to further the company's projects.

Ever since the closing of the reverse merger in December 2015 , the Company has taken out 19 short-term loans via convertible notes totaling $8.546 million . The money from these loans was mainly used for paying the proposed upfront deposit payments for acquiring another entity, Wuhan Economic Development Port Limited (""Wuhan Port EDP""). Because the acquisition of Wuhan Port EDP as aborted, the Company began repaying the convertible notes from the loan proceeds. As of the end of November 2018 , the Company has repaid $9.031 million ( $7.846 million in principal plus $1.184 million in interest), leaving an unpaid principal of $699,000 .

Contrary to the Report, the Company's CEO, Mr. Xiangyao Liu has not only not received a penny from these loans but has advanced as much as $485,000 towards the payment of the $9.031 million by the Company and will likewise advance the forthcoming redemption of an unexpired principal of $699,000 plus interest.

Hindenburg quoted the following from the Company's Quarter Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 :

The Report concluded that there was a total repayment of ""loans"" of approximately $6.2 million to Mr. Liu. This is not the case. The Report focused on the numbers highlighted in the red circles but neglected the increased amounts highlighted in the green circles which showed increased advances from Mr. Liu to the Company. The net effect of the aforementioned numbers shows a net advance from Mr. Liu to the Company. In addition, as mentioned in the Report, ""the total amount of those 19 convertible notes amounted to $8.5 million, of which $3.39 million is outstanding while $5.15 million has been redeemed."" As such, there is no way that Mr. Liu would have received $6.2 million from the proceeds of the notes.

""The Report contains numerous errors of facts and misleading speculations that are libelous and we categorically deny such speculations. This Report is largely a rehash of prior allegations made against us and only focuses on certain discrete information to cultivate a distorted view of the Company"", said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ""We have not granted access to Hindenburg nor has Hindenberg ever contacted us to seek any clarification or explanation to the allegations made. These speculations have caused significant damage to our Company and we are resolved to take such actions necessary to defend ourselves and protect the interests of our shareholders. Additionally, we have instructed counsel to explore our recourse against Hindenburg for making such irresponsible, baseless and libelous statements, including but not limited to instituting legal proceedings against them. We are committed to a high level of corporate governance and stand by the integrity of our financial statements and business operations. We will be conducting a special internal investigation into the other allegations made and will report the outcome of such investigation in due course.""

Full Year 2018 Financial Results

Interest and fee income

For the year of 2018, total interest and fee income, which include interest and fees on its direct lending loans, management and assessment service fees and interest on deposits with banks, was $0.26 million, compared to $16.53 million for the prior year. The significant decrease in loans issued was caused by a combined effect of business slow-down of the direct lending loans in Xinjiang area as a result of management assessment of economic environment in supply chain financing in Urumqi and increasing past due loan receivable and interest receivable which resulted in reversal of interest income. since the second half of 2017.

Interest expenses

The Company used borrowed funds, including short-term bank loans, secured loan and loans from third parties, to fund its direct lending business. Total interest expenses decreased by $0.47 million, or 6.4%, to $6.90 million for the year of 2018 from $ 7.37 million for the prior year mainly due to interest penalty from overdue loans. The loans with the amount of $154.41 million were overdue.

Provision for loan losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance ASU 2016-13 for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, which is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information and will likely result in earlier recognition of credit reserves.

CECL adoption will have broad impact on the financial statements of financial services firms, which will affect key profitability and solvency measures. Some of the more notable expected changes include:

Higher loan loss reserve levels and related deferred tax assets. While different asset types will be impacted differently, the expectation is that reserve levels will generally increase across the board for all financial firms.

Increased reserve levels may lead to a reduction in capital levels.

As a result of higher reserving levels, the expectation is that CECL will reduce cyclicality in financial firms' results, as higher reserving in ""good times"" will mean that less dramatic reserve increases will be loan related income (which will continue to be recognized on a periodic basis based on the effective interest method) and the related credit losses (which will be recognized up front at origination). This will make periods of loan expansion seem less profitable due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Periods of stable or declining loan levels will look comparatively profitable as the income trickles in for loans, where losses had been previously recognized.

Provision for loan losses increased by $30.42 million, or 55%, to $85.72 million for the year of 2018 from $55.30 million for the prior year. The increase was mainly related to more loans past due over 180 days as compared to that during the year ended December 31, 2017 as certain customers were facing financial difficulties since the second half of 2017 that caused increased provision rate charged for loan losses for the year 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management continued to assess the adequacy of the allowances in a cautious manner. Management assessed the collectability of loan receivable balances on an individual basis and concluded the collection from certain borrowers is remote . The following table summarizes provisions for loan losses.

At the end of each period, we conduct an aging analysis of each customer's arrears to determine whether the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. In establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider historical experience, the economic environment, trends in the construction industry, expected collectability of amounts receivable that are past due, and the expected collectability of overdue receivables. An estimate of doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. As a result, total allowance of $128.93 million was recorded for the year of 2018, compared to $64.29 million for the prior year. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had 75 and 59 business loan customers, and 159 and 174 personal loan customers, respectively. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

Financial Condition and Going Concern

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.31 million, compared to $1.22 million as of December 31, 2017. Net loans receivable was $92.58 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $117.26 million at the end of 2017. Short-term bank loans, loans from a cost method investee, loans from third parties and secured loan were $7.98 million, $14.54 million, $3.31 million and $79.21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to $11.97 million, $15.37 million, $nil and $15.34 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.

Most of our customers are MSMEs and individual proprietors located in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province and Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Our customers are involved in the commerce and service, energy and mining, real estate, agriculture and husbandry, supply chain financing, construction and decoration, manufacturing, consumer credit and other industries. In particular, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, loans to the tire supply chain financing industry accounts for 35.9% and 46.5% of total amounts of loans originated by the Company, loans to commerce and service industry accounts for 24.9% and 39.8% of total amount of loans, and loans to construction and decoration industry accounts for 23.0% and nil of total amount of loans. The capital liquidity of the Company was also influenced consequently due to a decrease in cash inflows provided by operating activities. The company's operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and if the Company will be able to maintain profitability and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and /or manage operating expense in line with revenue forecasts, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability.

The Company's accounts have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern basis. The following includes conditions give rise to substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date and management's plans to mitigate these adverse conditions:

The Company had an accumulated deficit of $136.62 million, negative net asset of $36 million and total liabilities of $122.02 million as of December 31, 2018. Assessing that the Company was not able to keep the size of lending business within one year from the financial statement issuance date, the Company established Zhiyuan and Zeshi in November 2018, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, including business factoring program, financing products design, related corporate financing solutions, investments and asset management, etc. as part of its restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2018, Zhiyuan disbursed loans of aggregating $64.7 million to four customers.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred operating loss of $94.13 million. Affected by the reduction of lending business and increased loans losses, the management was in the opinion that recurring operating losses would be made continue within one year from the financial statement issuance date. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred negative operating cash flow of $2.20 million. However with the establishment of Zhiyuan and Zeshi, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, the management assessed the Company would have a positive operating cash flow within one year from the financial statement issuance date.

The Company has been actively seeking for strategic investors with experience in lending business as well as financial investors. On July 10, 2018, the Company closed a registered direct offering pursuant to a previously announced securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, raising approximately $1.69 million, net of issuance costs, from selling its ordinary shares at a price of $2.60 per share. The Company plans to continue to seek fund resources as well as strategic investors for additional financing.

Though management had plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statements issuance date, as there is no assurance that the liquidity plan will be successfully implemented. Failure to successfully implement the plan will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial position, and will materially adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern.

On January 16, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from Xinjiang superior people's court. China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd. sued the Company and its guarantors for a default on the loan, plus penalties. On September 18, 2018, Xinjiang Superior People's Court adjudicated that the Company shall repay the principal, interest and penalties owed to China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd, aggregating US$16.4 million. The Company is now in the process of appeal and is actively negotiating with China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd about the debt restructuring, but there is no agreement achieved as of the date of the announcement.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company was involved in five lawsuits with its loan customers for the aggregated claim of delinquent balances of $2.95 million, and in which the Company is a defendant. The amount which the Company is being sued for delinquent balances owned to two third parties is approximately $4.64 million.

Recent Updates

In April 2019, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the disposition of Xinjiang Xin Quan Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (""Xin Quan""). As of the date of disposition, Xin Quan was not engaged in any operations, nor had any net assets.

On February 4, 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a framework agreement to acquire up to 80.46% of equity interest in Zhejiang Lixin Enterprise Management Holding Co., Ltd.

Pursuant to such framework agreement, the Company will acquire the equity interest in Lixin from six selling shareholders of Lixin by issuing new shares and/or using cash on hand. The proposed transaction is expected to be consummated through multiple closings with the first closing by June 30, 2019, subject to further review and approval of the Company's Board of Directors and/or shareholders, if needed, as well as other customary closing conditions. There is no guarantee that the transaction contemplated under the framework agreement will be consummated as planned or at all. The Company expects that the acquisition of equity interests in Lixin, if consummated, has the potential of transforming the Company into a profitable and well diversified financial services company with geographical outreach well beyond the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Company also announced that its business factoring services business, which the Company launched in late November through its recently incorporated subsidiary, Zhiyuan Factoring (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd.

On August 6, 2018, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Xin Quan that engages in the business of financial leasing, increased its registered capital from US$30.0 million to US$50.0 million. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company, through China Fenghui Financial Holdings Group, holds a 60% interest in Xin Quan and Xinjiang Heli Kaiyuan Construction Co., Ltd. (""Heli Kaiyuan"") holds a 40% interest in Xin Quan.

On July 6, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two institutional investors for a registered direct placement of approximately $2.0 million gross proceeds from selling its ordinary shares at a price of $2.60 per share. The Company issued a total of 769,232 ordinary shares to institutional investors. As part of the transaction, the Company issued to the investors Series A warrants to purchase up to 576,924 ordinary shares at an exercise price of $2.60 per share, which warrants have a term of four (4) years from the date of issuance. The investors also received Series B warrants with an initial face amount of 200,000 ordinary shares, which are subject to adjustment not in excess of an aggregate of 462,843 ordinary shares for nominal consideration. The transaction was closed on July 10, 2018.

On May 21, 2018, the Company announced the expansion of its service offerings with the launch of its financial leasing services. The financial leasing services will be operated through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Xin Quan and Ningbo Ding Tai Financial Leasing Co.

Both subsidiaries will benefit from a corporate income tax exemption for their initial five years, and half exemption for following five years. There are no business operations of the two subsidiaries as of the date of the announcement.

On May 08, 2018, the Company entered into agreement with Heli Kaiyuan to transfer 33.33% equity shared of Xin Quan, with consideration of $nil. Then, Xin Quan's board of directors passed a resolution to increase the registered capital to $50 million from $30 million. And on the same day, the Company signed shareholding entrustment agreement with Heli Kaiyuan to state that Heli Kaiyuan holds 20% equity interest in Xin Quan on behalf of the Company. As a result, the Company holds 60% equity interest in Xin Quan. On August 06, 2018, the change in registration has been completed.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

(NASDAQ: CCIH) and Encourages ChinaCache Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, Aug. 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of investors that purchased ChinaCache International Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ: CCIH) securities between April 10, 2015 and May 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). Investors have until August 12, 2019 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Click here to participate in the action.

The complaint, filed on June 12, 2019, alleges that on April 29, 2019 ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for fiscal year 2018. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (""Chairman""), Song Wang (""Wang""), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

Further, on May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019, because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the ""NASDAQ Letter""). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache's engagement of its new auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

(the ""Company"" or ""Del Frisco's"") and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced the completion of the transaction under which L Catterton has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Del Frisco's for approximately $650 million. As a result of the transaction's close, Del Frisco's stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In conjunction with closing, L Catterton has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille assets to Landry's, Inc. (""Landry's"") for an undisclosed consideration. The transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""We are confident that the separation of the business and the sale of the steak concepts to Landry's creates the best opportunity to unlock value in all of the Company's restaurant brands,"" said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. ""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Mr. Taub added, ""We look forward to leveraging L Catterton's deep restaurant experience and operational capabilities to help bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar reach their full potential.

WeissLaw is also concerned whether the deal creates shareholder value for DFRG's shareholders. Specifically, WeissLaw is investigating whether DFRG's Board conducted a fair process in agreeing to the proposed merger, whether the proposed merger undervalues the Company, and whether all material information related to the proposed merger is fully and fairly disclosed.

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants. As a result, Emmaus common stock and warrants will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market at the start of trading on Wednesday, September 11, 2019. It is expected that the company's common stock and warrants will be eligible for quotation on the OTC market after that date.

In its letter to Emmaus, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel recognized that the company is doing important work and expressed its hope that Emmaus securities may again trade on Nasdaq once the company meets Nasdaq's initial listing standards. Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications. We will continue to focus on our mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies.""

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

Operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was reduced to $1.2 million, versus $7.2 million last year.

As previously disclosed, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI were converted into shares of EMI common stock and cancelled in the merger in exchange for Emmaus shares, with a resulting increase in stockholders' equity. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock at a current conversion price of $9.52, subject to possible future adjustments.

Recent Highlights



Received clearance on its investigational new drug application from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the study of a new L-glutamine treatment for patients suffering from diverticulosis. EMI commenced a pilot/phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of its treatment at multiple study sites, with patents approved in the United States , the EU, China , Russia , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Australia and Indonesia . Emmaus has patents pending related to diverticulosis treatment in Brazil and India .

Entered into an exclusive agreement with taiba Healthcare for the registration, commercialization and distribution of Endari in certain countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

As previously reported, on July 17, 2019, Emmaus, formerly known as ""MYnd Analytics, Inc.,"" completed its merger transaction with EMI, whereby EMI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emmaus and the business of Emmaus became that of EMI. On July 18, 2019, Emmaus common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMA.""

Since the merger transaction occurred subsequent to the 2019 second quarter, Emmaus' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflects the historical business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and operations and financial results of the former MYnd Analytics which were spun off in conjunction with and prior to the merger. As a result, those results bear no relation to the company's current business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations. EMI's historical financial statements, along with pro forma financial information for Emmaus which give effect to the spin off and the merger, can be found in the exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A to be filed on August 14, 2019 which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.

Nasdaq Listing Status Update

Emmaus is currently reviewing a number of options related to maintaining the listing of its common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

Optical Fiber Market Overview :



Optical fiber refers to the medium and technology that is used to transmit information through a plastic or glass strand from one source to another. The information is transmitted through optical cables as rapid light pulses. The receiving end of a fiber optic transmission translates the light pulses into binary values. An optical fiber offers numerous advantages such as increased bandwidth, decreased size and weight, electromagnetic interference immunity, data security, electrical isolation, and others. These are used in communication applications, which include telecom, utility, community access television (CATV), military, and others and in non-communication applications such as sensor, fiber optic lighting, and others.



Growth in need for fast and improved networking and network services and increase in broadband connections in developing economies are anticipated to be the major drivers of the global optical fiber market. Moreover, rising demand for optical communication and sensing applications for different purposes, pressing demand for optical fiber cable (OFC) in the IT & telecom sector, increasing internet penetration, and surging adoption of fiber to the home (FTTH) connectivity are expected to drive the optical fiber industry growth. However, high installation cost and enhanced adoption of wireless communication systems are expected to impede the market growth.



Conversely, rise in government investments in fiber optic network cable (OFC network) infrastructures are expected to present major opportunities for market expansion during the forecast period. For instance, the Indian government has been investing in OFC network infrastructure to increase use and availability of internet across the country, which is in line with the government's initiatives such as Digital India and Smart Cities Mission.



The global optical fiber market is categorized based on mode, type, industry vertical, and region. Depending on mode, the market is bifurcated into single mode and multi-mode.

PlayTime with KittyPlays, a monthly series that will debut in the spring of 2019, will be a live esports entertainment and variety show, featuring top influencers and celebrity guests; competitive gameplay across a range of titles and genres; fan interaction and participation; and unique commentary on current news and esports issues, all streamed in front of a live studio audience at HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“I’m so excited to take my stream to the live stage and interact with my community in person,” said Michaela. “We are going to have an incredible lineup of guests on the show to talk, play and have some fun, and I can’t wait to share this experience with everyone in the arena and those watching on the live stream.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays will be the first of multiple original content debuts planned for release by Allied Esports this year. As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame Holdings International, will be acquired, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: BRAC), to form Allied Esports Entertainment. Creating premier live experiences, multiplatform content and interactive online services that reach and engage a worldwide audience of players and viewers, is a central part of Allied Esports Entertainment’s mission.

“Partnering with talented and popular streamers like KittyPlays to create fresh, interactive events and content is a key component of our growth strategy,” said Frank Ng, current CEO of Ourgame and expected CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “PlayTime is an outstanding kickoff to a year of what we intend to be a much larger, comprehensive content offering to come from Allied Esports, and we’re confident that Kristen’s magnetic personality and skill will carry this concept far beyond our own lofty expectations.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays, which will be produced by Allied Esports with Michaela serving as co-executive producer, will utilize Allied Esports’ multimillion-dollar broadcast studio and arena in the HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, featuring a two-story LED video wall, two-dozen cameras, wired player comms, and a dedicated control room for game observers called The Observatory, to create an unparalleled live experience and compelling streamed and post-produced content that will be available to viewers following each episode. Allied Esports has produced a number of original productions over the past year, including Ninja Vegas ’18 starring Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, which at the time set a new Twitch record for viewers on an individual stream and garnered 2.4 million unique viewers over the seven-hour event.

Each episode of PlayTime with KittyPlays will feature approximately six hours of original content, including:

Michaela and her guests leading into the live program with a “Just Chatting” pre-show stream on their individual channels starting two hours beforehand;

Topical and personal thought-provoking conversations with esports’ top influencers and celebrity guests energized by live audience member and stream chat participation;

Michaela’s unique perspective on recent events and issues facing today’s gaming communities;

Live, high-level gameplay, including “Squad Fills” and challenges with Michaela’s special guests and lucky audience members chosen at random.

Segments showcasing Michaela teaching pro athletes and celebrity gamers how to improve their craft;

Pre-recorded video shorts highlighting up-and-coming esports stars.

Led by Michaela’s naturally inclusive and positive personality, PlayTime with KittyPlays will also focus on giving a voice to those in the esports space who have gone unrecognized, who hail from diverse backgrounds, and who have overcome adversity to achieve personal bests in gaming and beyond.

Information about live guests, show dates, tickets and viewing platforms will be released in the coming weeks. Fans can follow @KittyPlays, @Allied Esports and @HyperXESALV and visit alliedesports.gg and hyperxesportsarenalasvegas.com for updates and additional news.

Michaela started her career in esports as a Counter-Strike player and began streaming her gameplay on Twitch while attending the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. After seeing success with her broadcasts, Michaela decided to leave school to pursue streaming full time, leading her to the wildly popular game of Fortnite. Since then, Michaela has taken streaming and social media by storm with her focus on positivity, community, and joy in gaming and everyday life. Whether broadcasting games, traveling the world, designing cosplay characters, or simply living a health-conscious life, Michaela’s style and personality play a large part in the creation of her content.

Michaela, who primarily plays Fortnite on her stream, is host to one million-plus followers on Twitch and boasts more than a million monthly viewers between Twitch, YouTube and other social media channels. During E3’s 2018 Celebrity Pro-Am event she paired with actor Chandler Riggs (The Walking Dead) and carried the duo to a third-place finish winning $250,000, with her portion donated to her local charity of choice, Kelowna BC SPCA. Most recently she teamed up with FaZe Clan’s Turner “Tfue” Tenney to compete in Korea’s Fortnite Open. Michaela again dominated the competition and together the pair took home a first-place prize of $1,000,000 to be donated to charity.

What started as a part-time hobby to meet likeminded friends has grown into a career that delivers enthusiasm and positivity to Michaela’s audiences, creating real connections around the world and leaving a lasting positive effect on everyone that watches her. Michaela is the founder of Team Kitty, a Twitch-based networking and mentorship team that enhances Michaela’s vision to create a network of female creators focused on upbeat personalities and high-level viewer interaction. Michaela is currently the Head of New Gaming Initiatives for esports organization Gen.G, with a focus on signing competitive players for its female Fortnite team, as well as sales and building of Gen.G’s newly renamed brand.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today provided an operational and financial update for its subsidiaries Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa Upstream”) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher Midstream”) and announced that Alta Mesa Upstream has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



Operational Update

Alta Mesa Upstream

First quarter 2019 production is estimated to be 37,800 BOE per day (48% oil, 71% liquids). Alta Mesa Upstream entered the year with six rigs actively working and reduced the rig count to zero by the end of January. A new development program was restarted in March by completing 16 drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) and operating two drilling rigs. The Company’s objective with the development program is to improve economic returns through a revised well spacing pattern of four or five wells per section, improved lateral placement and lower well costs. Under the reinvigorated development program, Alta Mesa Upstream has drilled 10 wells completing eight patterns (including the DUCs) and through May 17, 2019 had brought 22 new wells onto production. These wells are all tied into Kingfisher Midstream’s system.

The wells drilled and completed in 2019 have been averaging less than $3.0 million per well compared to $4.5 million per well experienced by the end of the previous drilling program. The Company has also made material progress on reducing lease operating expenses on a unit cost basis and lowering recurring general and administrative costs. More detail will be provided when it reports first quarter 2019 financial results.

Kingfisher Midstream

Kingfisher Midstream’s estimated first quarter volumes are summarized below.

System Gas Volumes 137 MMcf per day

Produced Water Volumes 85,000 Bbl per day

Crude Oil Volumes 6,600 Bbl per day

Proved Reserves

On February 25, 2019, Alta Mesa Upstream provided an initial estimate of 158 MMBoe for December 31, 2018 proved reserves. Based on its April 2019 assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and the uncertainty of funding the related development costs, Alta Mesa Upstream removed a total of 89 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2018, Alta Mesa Upstream had 69 MMBoe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 25 MMBbl of oil, 20 MMBbl of natural gas liquids and 144 Bcf of natural gas. The reserves have a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $813 million. Should Alta Mesa Upstream’s ability to fund the required development costs improve in the future, Alta Mesa Upstream expects to recognize all or a portion of the removed PUD reserves as proved.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update

At May 1, 2019, Alta Mesa Resources had debt with total face value of $1,061 million and $144 million of total liquidity, including $110 million of cash. Alta Mesa Upstream’s total debt was $868 million, comprised of $368 million utilized on its credit facility and $500 million of senior notes. The Company previously disclosed that Alta Mesa Upstream had drawn substantially all remaining capacity under its Credit Facility on April 1, 2019. As of May 1, Alta Mesa Upstream’s liquidity includes $95 million of cash.

Kingfisher Midstream had total borrowings on May 1, 2019 of $193 million within its available credit capacity of $225 million, resulting in liquidity of $47 million comprised of $32 million of available borrowing capacity and $15 million cash on hand. Until the delivery of audited 2018 and unaudited first quarter 2019 financial statements and the related compliance certificates, Kingfisher Midstream is limited to $225 million of borrowing capacity. Once those financials are delivered, the borrowing capacity, subject to continued covenant compliance, will return to $300 million.

The Company continues to make progress in finalizing its Form 10-K as well the first quarter 2019 Forms 10-Q for both Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Upstream but is unable to estimate the date at which these filings will be completed.

NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards

The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified Alta Mesa Resources on May 14, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and because the Company remains delinquent in filing its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Initial Delinquent Filing”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa Resources is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing by June 3, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Initial Delinquent Filing, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing.

Provides Bank Borrowing Update; Retains Financial Advisor; Receives NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards","HOUSTON, April 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today announced that Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“AMH”) had drawn substantially all of the remaining capacity under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of $370 million after the most recent borrowing base determination on April 1, 2019, which decreased the borrowing base by $30 million. The cash held following the draw, approximately $86 million, is intended for general corporate purposes.



James Hackett, the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In this challenging environment, we believe it is important to increase our liquidity to ensure we have adequate financial flexibility. We will continue to explore our options to strengthen our balance sheet, including options to address our indebtedness.”

Alta Mesa has retained Perella Weinberg Partners and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. as its financial advisor to assist with analyzing and considering financial alternatives.

Alta Mesa today also announced that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified the Company on April 2, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Annual Report”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing within 60 calendar days from the date of notification, or by June 1, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Annual Report's filing due date, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

The Annual Report was not filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time period because the Company needs additional time to complete its financial statements and related disclosures. As previously announced, the Company expects to report material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company has taken additional time to ensure the accuracy of its 2018 financial information, to complete the required discussion and analysis of the business and to finalize the conclusions regarding the assessment of internal control. Although the Company is still completing its testing of internal control, it has not identified material misstatements to its previously filed financial information and believes that no restatements to historical periods will be required. While covenant relief was not attained during the borrowing base redetermination, the Company continues to be in discussions with its lenders under the Credit Facility. If unsuccessful in obtaining relief, the Company may be unable to comply with the terms of the Credit Facility during 2019, which would permit the lenders to cease making amounts available under the Credit Facility, to require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and to exercise other rights under the Credit Facility.

Alta Mesa is working to complete the Annual Report and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Alta Mesa also announced today that NASDAQ notified the Company on April 3, 2019 that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the NASDAQ rules for continued listing. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ’s exchange. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 30, 2019, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 30, 2019, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and September 30, 2019 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed compliance period. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notice.

(Nasdaq:CRAY) today released the findings of its industry report on the State of Enterprise AI Adoption 2019 , which reveals that performance, data locality and security are the top considerations for choosing an AI infrastructure. The survey assessed whether organizations and individuals are prepared to run AI effectively and to take advantage of the capabilities it offers. Findings show that over 70% of companies already have AI applications in use or under development, and as the use of AI grows, IT professionals must consider what infrastructure is needed to maximize the value, scale and performance of their AI workloads.



The State of Enterprise AI Adoption 2019 survey was constructed to help identify the state of enterprise AI adoption, evaluate the perception and value of AI in the enterprise and determine the infrastructure being used to execute AI workflows. The report findings, based on responses of more than 300 IT professionals across a broad range of industries, show that many organizations, 39%, are using supercomputers, HPC systems or dedicated AI hardware to run their AI workloads. For these organizations using on-premises systems, over 60% expect to expand their infrastructure to keep pace with increasing storage and performance demands.

“The research highlights that supercomputing plays an important role in enabling mainstream AI adoption in the enterprise,” said Frederick Kohout, senior vice president and CMO at Cray. “IT professionals see the need to expand their use of on-premises infrastructure, like supercomputers and HPC clusters, to meet the expected growth of business-critical AI applications. Cray’s new Shasta supercomputing systems were designed to handle data-intensive workloads, like AI, and can scale seamlessly from a single cabinet to exascale-class systems so every Enterprise can start small and grow without interruption or penalty.”

Enterprise AI Production Environments Hybridized with Cloud and On-Premises Infrastructure

Nearly 40% of those surveyed said their organizations currently use on-premises systems to execute AI workloads. This includes infrastructure like supercomputers, high performance computing clusters and dedicated AI nodes. And according to these respondents, the top two considerations for utilizing on-premises systems are performance and data locality/security.

While about 40% report using on-premises systems,

65% of respondents with AI applications in use stated they need to expand their on-premises systems to keep pace with increasing performance requirements

35% of respondents are looking to move some of their cloud workloads to on-premises systems

53% of respondents noted that their organization utilizes public cloud services to run AI workloads

The research indicates that many organizations are operating a hybrid data center and rely on the use of multiple systems to run AI applications. Over 70% of those using on-premises systems have also implemented AI in the public cloud, and over half of all public cloud users also utilize on-premises infrastructure for their AI workloads.

Also of note, nearly 60% of IT professionals identified cost-effectiveness as a top consideration when selecting an infrastructure solution for AI. This was followed by the ability to integrate AI systems into existing architecture (50.8%), ease of use (49.2%) and scaling with increasing uses and demands (39.8%). With these being the top infrastructure considerations, it explains why so many organizations utilize both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. By utilizing both, enterprises get the ease of use and cost-effectiveness of the cloud with the performance and scalability of on-premises systems.

“This survey by Cray is consistent with our own AI research studies,” said Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research. “Training for machine learning requires high performance computing, either on-premise or in the cloud, and there is a significant overlap between AI investment and systems for HPC and hyperscale. One way or another, those interested in AI need to access a high-performance infrastructure.”

Other Key Research Findings

High levels of educational activity: 72% of respondents participated in one or more activities to educate themselves on AI in the past year. Over 48% attended AI conferences or received training, over 41% participated in vendor webinars, about 40% took self-study courses and over 35% downloaded and read reports on AI.

Reports 2018 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Feb. 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.

All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

For 2018, Cray reported total revenue of $456 million, which compares with $393 million in 2017. Net loss for 2018 was $72 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $134 million, or $3.33 per diluted share in 2017. Non-GAAP net loss, which adjusts for selected unusual and non-cash items, was $58 million, or $1.42 per diluted share for 2018, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $41 million, or $1.01 per diluted share in 2017.

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $163 million, compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $13 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $98 million, or $2.42 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Please note, 2017 GAAP results were impacted by both the new U.S. tax law and a change to the valuation allowance held against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The combined negative impact on the Company’s 2017 GAAP net loss was $103 million and was excluded for non-GAAP purposes.

For 2018, overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 29%, compared to 33% and 34%, respectively, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2017.

GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $204 million, compared to $196 million in 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $191 million, compared to $177 million in 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, cash, investments, and restricted cash totaled $246 million. Working capital at the end of 2018 was $291 million, compared to $354 million at December 31, 2017.

“Led by strength in our commercial business, we delivered solid growth for the year,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “While our target market continues to show signs of a rebound from its recent lows, 2019 is shaping up to be a transition year as we plan to begin shipping our next generation Shasta platform late this year. Shasta will deliver a balance of performance, flexibility and ease of use unlike anything available today, as well as a true exascale-class architecture capable of scaling well into the future. With continued focus and execution, we are well positioned to expand on our market leadership position and deliver strong long-term growth.”

Outlook

For 2019, while a wide range of results remains possible, Cray expects revenue to grow modestly compared to 2018. Revenue is expected to be about $70 million for the first quarter of 2019. For 2019, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be in the 30% range, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow compared to 2018. Based on this outlook, the Company expects to recognize a substantial GAAP and non-GAAP net loss for 2019.

Cray’s effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2019 are both expected to be in the low single-digit range.

Actual results for any future periods are subject to large fluctuations given the nature of Cray’s business.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

Additionally, we have not quantitatively reconciled the non-GAAP guidance measures disclosed under “Outlook” to their corresponding GAAP measures because we do not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items such as share-based compensation, adjustments to the provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles, costs related to acquisitions, purchase accounting adjustments, and gain on significant asset sales, as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations to the non-GAAP guidance measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our financial results.

(Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced that the first Cray Shasta™ supercomputing system for operational weather forecasting and meteorology will be acquired by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The powerful high-performance computing capabilities of the new system, named HPC11, will enable higher fidelity weather forecasts for U.S. Air Force and Army operations worldwide. The contract is valued at $25 million.



“We’re excited with our Oak Ridge National Laboratory strategic partner’s selection of Cray to provide Air Force Weather’s next high performance computing system,” said Steven Wert, Program Executive Officer Digital, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, and a member of the Senior Executive Service. “The system’s performance will be a significant increase over the existing HPC capability and will provide Air Force Weather operators with the ability to run the next generation of high-resolution, global and regional models, and satisfy existing and emerging warfighter needs for environmental impacts to operations planning.”

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a history of deploying the world’s most powerful supercomputers and through this partnership, will provide supercomputing-as-a-service on the HPC11 Shasta system to the Air Force 557th Weather Wing. The 557th Weather Wing develops and provides comprehensive terrestrial and space weather information to the U.S. Air Force and Army. The new system will feature the revolutionary Cray Slingshot™ interconnect, with features to better support time-critical numerical weather prediction workloads, and will enhance the Air Force’s capabilities to create improved weather forecasts and weather threat assessments so that Air Force missions can be carried out more effectively.

“The HPC11 system will be the first Shasta delivery to the production weather segment, and we’re proud to share this milestone with ORNL and the Air Force,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO at Cray. “The years of innovation behind Shasta and Slingshot and the success of prior generations of Cray systems continue to demonstrate Cray’s ability to support demanding 24/7 operations like weather forecasting. This is a great example of the upcoming Exascale Era bringing a new set of technologies to bear on challenging problems and empowering the Air Force to more effectively execute on its important mission.”

HPC11 will be ORNL’s first Cray Shasta system, as well as the first supercomputing system with 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ processors for use in operational weather forecasting. HPC11 will join the 85% bastion of weather centers that rely on Cray, and will feature eight Shasta cabinets in a dual-hall configuration.

“We are incredibly excited to continue our strategic collaboration with Cray to deliver the first Shasta supercomputer to the U.S. Air Force, helping to improve the fidelity of weather forecasts for U.S. military operations around the globe,” said Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager, Datacenter and Embedded Systems Group, AMD. “The 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors provide exceptional performance in highly complex workloads, a necessary component to power critical weather prediction workloads and deliver more accurate forecasts.”

The system is expected to be delivered in Q4 2019 and accepted in early 2020.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

(NASDAQ: DVCR), a premier provider of long-term care services, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019.



First Quarter 2019 Highlights

Net loss from continuing operations was $(3.3) million, or $(0.52) per share, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $(0.1) million, or $(0.01) per share, in the first quarter of 2018.

Our adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $15.5 million, compared to $18.2 million in the first quarter of 2018.

Under the new Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") 842, the Company recorded net leased assets and liabilities of $384 million and $389 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our operational and financial performance during the first quarter of 2019 continued to reflect the challenges we have been experiencing in our industry, but we do have some opportunities for improvement on the horizon. Our Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care rates all increased during the quarter. The increases are a combination of cost reimbursement along with acuity factors for our centers. We have enrolled the majority of our Texas centers in the state’s Quality Incentive Payment Program, which we expect to be effective for these centers in September of this year. This program rewards operators who maintain high quality measures with enhanced Medicaid reimbursements. We are implementing cost reductions to align our overhead cost structure with the current environment. CMS has proposed a net 2.5% market basket increase for this coming October. Year over year, our skilled mix patients decreased from 16.1% in the first quarter of 2018 to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2019. It should be noted though that this quarter was the highest skilled mix we have seen since the first quarter of 2018.""

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""I am extremely grateful for and proud of our team members as they continue to be devoted to our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

First Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.9 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 10.1 % 11.6 % Medicaid census 68.7 % 67.9 % Managed Care census 4.8 % 4.5 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 18.6 % 21.1 % Medicaid revenues 47.3 % 45.2 % Managed Care revenues 10.6 % 10.1 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 457.10 $ 455.72 Medicaid $ 181.13 $ 176.78 Managed Care $ 394.55 $ 391.96

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $134.4 million and $141.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $6.9 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 134,353 $ 136,571 $ (2,218 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,714 $ (4,714 ) Total revenue $ 134,353 $ 141,285 $ (6,932 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.7 million of the $6.9 million patient revenues decrease. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $2.2 million. Our average Medicaid and Medicare rates per patient day for the first quarter of 2019 increased compared to the first quarter of 2018, resulting in increases in revenue of $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, or 2.5% and 0.3%, respectively. Our Hospice average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 increased 15.8%, resulting in $1.0 million in additional revenue. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 13.4%, 0.1% and 10.1%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $4.1 million, $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Our ancillary revenue for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.3 million.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the first quarter of 2019 to $108.1 million as compared to $112.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.5% for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.5% for the first quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store operating expense $ 108,113 $ 109,101 $ (988 ) 2018 disposition operating expenses

— 3,177 (3,177 ) Total expense $ 108,113 $ 112,278 $ (4,165 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $3.2 million of the $4.2 million operating expense decrease. Our same-store operating expenses decreased by $1.0 million, which is mostly attributable to favorable variances in nursing and ancillary costs and salaries and related taxes of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable variances in dietary costs and maintenance and utilities expense of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $65.1 million during the first quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the first quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the $1.7 million impact of non-cash straight-line expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.4 million and $2.8 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.9 million and $1.1 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the accrual for professional liability.

General and administrative expense was $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2019 from 5.8% in the first quarter of 2018. The change in general and administrative expense is attributable to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in depreciation expense relates to the dispositions of Fulton, Clinton and Glasgow in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Interest expense was $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million first quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.2 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $4.3 million before income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. The benefit for income taxes was $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2019, and the benefit for income taxes was $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. Both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $0.52 for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations of $0.01 in the first quarter of 2018.

Receivables

Our net receivables balance decreased $2.4 million to $63.9 million as of March 31, 2019, from $66.3 million as of December 31, 2018.

We have included certain financial measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAR as EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as EBITDAR adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense and litigation contingency expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense, litigation contingency expense, tax impact related to those adjustments, and discontinued operations, net of tax. Funds Provided by Operations is defined as net income from operating activities adjusted for the cash effect of professional liability and other non-cash charges. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred tax benefit and other non-cash charges.

Our measurements of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses, separation costs and other items. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred taxes and other non-cash items. Our presentation of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

Second Quarter 2019 Highlights

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our primary update for the quarter is the announcement that we have reached an agreement in principle to settle the ongoing DOJ investigation into the Company’s therapy practices dating back to 2010. This investigation period predates our leadership team and has been a significant distraction for quite some time. We still have some work ahead of us to finalize the agreement and related Corporate Integrity Agreement, but reaching this agreement in principle represents substantial progress in resolving this matter. We ask that our investors please refer to our updated SEC filings for further information.""

Mr. McKnight continued, “You will note that we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this quarter via a non-cash tax expense item of $20 million. The accounting guidance related to matters like this is very complicated, but because of our government settlement and other financial factors we were required to complete the process of evaluating these assets this quarter. We believe we have significant positive financial evidence that we will continue to evaluate each quarter going forward.”

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""We made significant progress on our exit from Kentucky this quarter, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. Our industry continues to experience challenges and strong headwinds; however, I am proud and amazed by the level of commitment that our team members continue to exude in their efforts to deliver on our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

Second Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.8 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 9.7 % 10.6 % Medicaid census 69.2 % 68.9 % Managed Care census 4.6 % 4.2 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 17.9 % 19.7 % Medicaid revenues 47.5 % 46.5 % Managed Care revenues 10.5 % 9.4 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 458.33 $ 455.29 Medicaid $ 181.42 $ 177.58 Managed Care $ 393.81 $ 397.49

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $135.4 million and $141.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $5.7 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 135,370 $ 136,544 $ (1,174 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,538 (4,538 ) Total revenue $ 135,370 $ 141,082 $ (5,712 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.5 million of the $5.7 million decrease in patient revenues. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $1.2 million. Our average Medicaid rate per patient day for the second quarter of 2019 increased compared to the second quarter of 2018, resulting in an increase in revenue of $1.6 million, or 2.1%. Our Hospice and Managed Care average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 increased 14.2% and 7.6%, respectively, resulting in $1.0 million and $0.8 million in additional revenue, respectively. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 decreased 9.6%, 0.6% and 13.3%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $2.7 million, $0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the second quarter of 2019 to $108.6 million from $111.4 million in the second quarter of 2018, a decrease of $2.8 million. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.3% for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.0% for the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

2018

Change

Same-store operating expense $ 108,447 $ 107,850 $ 597 2018 disposition operating expenses

194 3,590 (3,396 ) Total expense $ 108,641 $ 111,440 $ (2,799 )





The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 reduced operating expenses by $3.4 million. Our same-store operating expenses increased by $0.6 million, which is mostly attributable to increases in health insurance costs of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by decreases in nursing and ancillary expenses and maintenance and utility costs of $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.8 million in the second quarter of 2018, to $65.2 million during the second quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the second quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the impact of non-cash straight-line rent expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.0 million and $3.2 million in the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.7 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims.

In June, 2019, the Company and the U.S. Department of Justice reached an agreement in principle on the financial terms of a settlement regarding a civil investigative demand. In anticipation of the execution of final agreements and payment of a settlement amount of $9.5 million, we recorded an additional loss contingency expense of $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 to increase our previously estimated and recorded liability related to this investigation.

General and administrative expense was $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $9.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019 from 6.6% in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease in general and administrative expense is mainly attributable to $1.2 million of executive severance expense in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining change is due to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in depreciation expense relates to the acceleration of depreciation for the leasehold improvements in Kentucky, which are expected to be abandoned in the third quarter of 2019.

Interest expense was $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.1 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

The Company recorded an income tax provision of $17.4 million during the second quarter of 2019 and an income tax benefit of $0.4 million during the second quarter of 2018. The increase in income tax expense is attributable to a non-cash charge for a valuation allowance recognized against our deferred tax assets in the amount of $20.0 million in the second quarter of 2019.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $7.2 million before income taxes for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2018.

We have included certain financial performance and valuation measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss), which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, debt retirement costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate and income (loss) from discontinued operations.

Our measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important financial performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses and separation costs. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

We have included Adjusted EBITDAR in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s valuation. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAR is an important financial valuation measure that is commonly used by our management, research analysts, investors, lenders and financial institutions, to compare the enterprise value of different companies in the healthcare industry, without regard to differences in capital structures and leasing arrangements. Adjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure and is not displayed as a performance measure as it excludes rent expense, which is a normal and recurring operating expense. As such, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR, should not be construed as a financial performance measure.

New Spin-Off Record Date Set for July 15, 2019



MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., July 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND) , a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, and Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today provided an update on the planned merger and spin-off transaction announced on January 7, 2019. The respective special stockholder meetings will be held today, July 9, 2019, to consider approval of the proposed merger and spin-off transaction. Subject to approval by holders of record of the companies at the respective special stockholder meetings, MYnd will issue a number of shares of common stock to the current Emmaus shareholders, which will result in MYnd shareholders retaining 5.9% of the fully diluted shares of the 'New Emmaus' post-closing and a pro rata distribution of one share of Telemynd’s common stock for each share of MYnd common stock held at the end of trading on July 16, 2019. The companies have set a new Spin-Off Record Date of July 15, 2019 in order to comply with certain NASDAQ and DTC requirements. Those individuals who hold shares at the close of trading on the 16th of July will receive the Telemynd dividend. MYnd shares will trade ex-dividend on July 17, which means that persons who purchase MYnd shares on July 17 will not receive shares of Telemynd.

It is expected that on July 16 and July 17, the necessary steps will occur to spin off Telemynd with the current MYnd assets, effectuate the merger and any adjustments needed to meet NASDAQ listing standards and commence trading on July 18, 2019 under the new symbol “EMMA.”

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “We are very grateful for this opportunity to merge with MYnd Analytics. The anticipated listing on Nasdaq via the merger with MYnd Analytics is an important step to maximize value for shareholders. We look forward to sharing with the public markets our progress on the market acceptance of Endari, which is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years and older. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other major clinical indications such as diverticulosis.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are pleased with the progress of the merger and spin-off transaction, which remains on track to close before the end of this month, subject to approval of shareholders. We believe this transaction will drive significant value for all shareholders, and we will provide further updates following the respective shareholder meetings.”

Endari addresses a $3 billion worldwide market

MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., Jan. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND), a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, today announced that it has entered into a definitive stock-for-stock merger agreement with Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Emmaus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MYnd Analytics in exchange for MYnd Analytics’ issuance of common stock to Emmaus shareholders and other equity holders. The exchange ratio will result in Emmaus securityholders owning approximately 94% of the MYnd Analytics’ common stock on a fully diluted basis after the merger. It is anticipated that the surviving company will change its name to Emmaus and receive a new ticker symbol to reflect the name change. The company expects to meet all applicable requirements for initial listing upon completion of the merger and, therefore, expects to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval from the shareholders of each company and Nasdaq approval. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as a financial advisor to Emmaus in connection with this transaction.

In connection with the transaction, MYnd Analytics intends to transfer all of its assets (including cash and its equity interest in Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services, LLC) and liabilities into its wholly-owned subsidiary, MYnd Analytics California, and to distribute the shares of MYnd Analytics California to MYnd Analytics’ shareholders as of a record date prior to the merger, which will be set prior to the merger effective time. MYnd Analytics expects that the MYnd Analytics California subsidiary, following the spinoff, will commence trading as an independent company at a date to be announced. Under the leadership of its new CEO, Patrick Herguth, the MYnd Analytics California spin off intends to continue operating, integrating and growing its technology-enabled telepsychiatry and teletherapy businesses in order to provide enhanced access to behavioral health services, improve patient outcomes and help lower the costs associated with behavioral health issues. MYnd-Arcadian customers include major health plans, health systems, and community-based organizations. The parties do not expect there to be any disruption to the existing business or customers.

Emmaus is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, including those in the rare and orphan disease categories. Its lead prescription product, Endari, demonstrated positive clinical results in a completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell disease and received FDA approval in July 2017. Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. The results of the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on July 19th, 2018.

Emmaus launched Endari in the United States in early 2018 and has experienced strong market uptake. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Additionally, Emmaus has distribution agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors, making Endari available to selected pharmacies nationwide.

Outside the United States, the treatment is currently available through an Early Access Program for sickle cell disease patients that have exhausted other treatment options. Emmaus is currently in the process of seeking marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency for its medication. Emmaus has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA which provides protection from competition in the United States and Orphan Medicinal designation from the European Commission for protection in the European Union.

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “The merger with MYnd Analytics, and concurrent Nasdaq listing, will be a major milestone for the company, and builds on our recent progress, including the FDA approval of Endari, the publication of our Phase 3 results in The New England Journal of Medicine , Medicaid coverage, the addition of major pharmaceutical distributors, and a presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 Annual Meeting. Just as important as these accomplishments was the launch and market acceptance of Endari – the first medication (FDA approved) for sickle cell disease in almost 20 years. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other clinical indications such as diverticulosis. Through this merger, we believe we can maximize value for shareholders and we are grateful to MYnd for this opportunity.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are excited to announce this definitive merger agreement with Emmaus, whereby the MYnd shareholders will own equity in Emmaus, and upon our expected spin-off, will continue to own 100% of the predictive analytics and telemedicine business, which we expect to begin operations as a new standalone public company. We are quite encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to further integrating and accelerating the growth of our offerings under Patrick Herguth’s leadership. We plan to provide further details on the new operational direction, branding, and growth strategy in the coming weeks and months.”

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle Cell Disease is an orphan disease with significant unmet medical needs, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide.

(NASDAQ: FRED) reported financial results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2019. Except as otherwise noted, the comparable results from the prior year contained herein have been adjusted for discontinued operations related to the sale of Fred’s specialty pharmacy business to an affiliate of CVS Health Corporation and certain assets of Fred’s retail pharmacy business to Walgreen Co. The amounts and percentages presented below, for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial conditions from Fred’s continuing operations.

Joe Anto, Fred’s CEO, stated, “We are disappointed with our operating results for the quarter, but are moving aggressively to right size our store footprint, reduce our cost structure, paydown our ABL and stabilize our operating model. As of June 17th, our ABL balance stood at $51.1 million versus $81.3 million at the end of Q1. We are continuing to work constructively with our banks and per our forbearance agreement, we have specific milestones related to refinancing our current facility, which we are actively working towards. We look forward to sharing updates on this process as soon as possible.”

Selling, general, and administrative expenses, adjusted for non-recurring items, were $93.4 million in Q1 2019, or 29.3% of sales, compared to $106.7 million in Q1 2018, or 31.7% of sales.

First Quarter 2019 Results



Fred’s net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 5.2% to $319.0 million from $336.4 million in the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 8.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. The sales decline was primarily the result of weak sales of consumables caused by the reduction in store traffic due to out-of-stock issues in certain product categories.

Fred’s gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 16.2% to $74.6 million from $89.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 309 basis points to 23.4% from 26.5% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage was primarily caused by discounting initiatives implemented during the quarter throughout the store chain.



Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter decreased $7.9 million to $101.4 million compared to last year’s first quarter of $109.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 68 basis points to 31.8% of sales from 32.5% of sales in the first quarter last year. The decrease is generally attributable to continued reductions in headcount and other general cost-containment initiatives implemented throughout the company.



Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $93.4 million, or 29.3% of sales, in Q1 of 2019 compared to $106.7 million, or 31.7% of sales, in Q1 of 2018.



Due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles in several underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. Comparatively, in the first quarter of 2018, no impairment expense was incurred.



For the first quarter of 2019, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $29.5 million, or $(0.84) per share, compared to a net loss of $22.0 million, or $(0.60) per share, during the same period in 2018. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to a decline in the sales volume during the period ended May 4, 2019 compared to the prior year.



Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(11.7) million compared to $(7.4) million in the first quarter of 2018.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 resulted in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which constitutes an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced store closures, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s has entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders pursuant to which Fred’s stipulated to the occurrence of certain events of default and such lenders agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to not take any action to accelerate our indebtedness or exercise other remedies until July 22, 2019. There can be no assurance that such lenders will not do so on or after such date or if the conditions in the forbearance agreement are not met in the future. For additional information regarding this agreement and Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern, please see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2019 and Fred’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 4, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 18, 2019.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation. amortization and impairment expense (i.e. Total selling, general and administrative expenses) and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(48.1) million in fiscal 2018 compared to $20.3 million in fiscal 2017.

Fourth Quarter 2018 Results

Fred’s net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 17.2% to $307.1 million from $370.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 9.7% compared to a 4.8% decrease in the fourth quarter of last year.

Fred’s gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 22.1% to $71.7 million from $92.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 147 basis points to 23.4% from 24.8% in the same quarter last year.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $23.6 million to $136.7 million compared to last year’s fourth quarter of $113.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses, increased 1,400 basis points to 44.5% of sales from 30.5% of sales in the fourth quarter last year.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $102.6 million, or 33.4% of sales, in Q4 of 2018 compared to $108.4 million, or 29.2% of sales, in Q4 of 2017.

Due primarily to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles related to underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $31.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Comparatively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Fred’s recorded impairment expense of $2.5 million.

For the fourth quarter of 2018, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $67.2 million, or $(1.86) per share, compared to a net loss of $25.4 million, or $(0.68) per share, during the same period in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(17.7) million compared to $31.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Fiscal Year End 2018 Results

Net sales for 2018 decreased to $1.272 billion from $1.396 billion in 2017 for a year-over-year decrease of $124.1 million or 8.9%. Comparable store sales for 2018 decreased 1.6% from the same period last year. Front store (non-pharmacy) sales decreased 11.8% over 2017 front store sales. The decrease year over year was primarily due to the clearance of merchandise that management identified as under-productive combined with our out of stock position of many key front store items.

Fred’s gross profit for the year decreased to $323.0 million in 2018 from $363.8 million in 2017, a year-over-year decrease of $40.8 million, or 11.2%. Gross margin rate, measured as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.4% in 2018 from 26.1% in 2017, an approximately 70-basis point decline. Factors contributing to the decline in gross margin were related to continued pressures Fred’s experienced in its retail pharmacy business, specifically related to prescription rebates in 2017 that did not recur in 2018 and an increase in DIR fees paid to PBMs. In the front store, gross margin was impacted by promotional markdowns as well as a shift in sales mix from general merchandise to food and consumables.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $452.5 million, or 35.6% of sales, in 2018 from $500.8 million, or 35.9% of sales, in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of bank fees, financing termination fees and professional fees incurred in 2017 related to the attempted Rite Aid acquisition and the closing of 39 underperforming stores in the prior year that were not repeated in 2018. Additionally, costs decreased as a result of the cost containment measures experienced during fiscal 2018.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $409.3 million, or 32.2% of sales, for the fiscal year 2018 compared to $439.2 million, or 31.5% of sales, for the same period in 2017.

Impairment expense of $33.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2018 related to long lived assets, including intangibles related to the decline in the results of operations compared to the $2.5 million recorded in fiscal 2017.

Net loss from continuing operations decreased $7.3 million to $137.2 million, or $(3.76) per share, in 2018 from a loss of $144.5 million, or $(3.87) per share, in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(48.1) million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $20.3 million in 2017.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 will result in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which will constitute an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement have indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced closure of 159 stores, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s is currently seeking an agreement with its lenders pursuant to which such lenders would forbear for a period of time from seeking remedies on account of, or waive, the foregoing events or potential events of default, but there is no assurance that Fred’s will receive such forbearance or waivers.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, announced today that the Company’s consolidated initial sales for its 2019/20 season pass offerings increased 20.8% on a unit basis and 19.8% on a dollar basis over the prior year through the discounted sales window, inclusive of Snow Time pass sales in both periods.



Jesse Boyd, Vice President of Operations, commented, “We are pleased with the continued robust growth for our season pass products as reflected in the 20.8% year over year growth in unit sales for the upcoming 2019/20 season, including healthy sales of our Peak Pass, which provides customers with unlimited skiing and riding across 14 of our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest resorts. Thanks to our investments and efforts to create consistent on-mountain conditions in the face of unpredictable weather, our customers know that their season pass will allow for season-long access to our mountains, regardless of weather. That consistency and the on- and off-mountain experience we provide are drivers of our season pass sales growth. In addition, our recent investments in customer outreach initiatives, including data and analytics attribution, social media, and strategic marketing and branding, are helping to better connect Peak Resorts with our customers as we showcase the value of our season pass offerings. We look forward to the upcoming season as we put further investments to work to create more compelling experiences across our mountains.”

The 2018/2019 season was one of the Company’s longest ski seasons in its history, including 147 days of skiing and riding at Mount Snow, 140 days at Hunter Mountain and an impressive 150 days at Wildcat. As our attention now turns to summer, Peak Resorts has a number of capital improvement projects planned for its growing resort portfolio. Work has already started on approximately $3.5 million in upgrades to the snowmaking infrastructure at Liberty Mountain, Whitetail and Roundtop Mountain in Pennsylvania. These investments across all three resorts will increase pump power and water capacity and add new state-of-the-art guns to markedly improve energy efficiency and overall snowmaking.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year as summarized below:



(in thousands, except per share data) Three months ended

April 30, Year ended

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues $ 85,458 $ 56,032 $ 184,426 $ 131,662 Resort operating costs $ 42,699 $ 31,951 $ 119,737 $ 96,593 Income from operations $ 30,402 $ 17,413 $ 28,916 $ 10,219 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders for basic EPS $ 17,283 $ 9,280 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Net income (loss) available to common shareholders adjusted for diluted EPS $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Income (Loss) per share (basic) $ 1.13 $ 0.66 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Income (Loss) per share (diluted) $ 0.83 $ 0.56 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding 15,166 13,982 14,504 13,982 Vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) 155 102 133 78 Dilutive effect of conversion of preferred stock 6,359 3,180 - - Dilutive effect of unvested RSUs 36 44 39 - Reported EBITDA* $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585 *See page 3 for Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Fiscal 2019 was a record year for Peak Resorts as we completed several transformational initiatives that drove robust year over year growth. We generated record revenue and Reported EBITDA of $184.4 million and $49.8 million, respectively, thanks to our successful Snow Time acquisition and the fantastic execution of our resort operating teams who provided our guests with great conditions throughout a season of variable weather. We also delivered double-digit growth across our season pass offerings, saw continued strength across key revenue streams including food and beverage, ski school and retail, and benefited from our geographic and market diversification and ongoing customer outreach initiatives.



“Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%. Many of our resorts benefited from our continued strategic investments, including at Mount Snow where we saw the benefit of the new Carinthia Base Lodge and at Hunter where we debuted a significant terrain expansion, contributing to increased visitation of 6% and 12%, respectively, at these resorts. In addition, consistent investments in snowmaking capacity and efficiency allowed us to ensure that our growing visitor base was able to access more terrain and more often throughout the season, even when challenged by variable weather.

“As expected, the Snow Time portfolio delivered strong results in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and throughout the season despite nearly 20 fewer operating days during the season. The initial implementation of our operating strategies at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop allowed us to more than offset the shorter season at each of the three resorts as we drove a significant improvement in profitability across the portfolio. Given that we completed the acquisition of Snow Time right before the start of the 2018-19 season, we expect to see added benefits going forward as we further refine operations at these resorts.

“As announced in early May, 2019-20 season pass sales were very strong through the discounted sales window and we expect this momentum to continue. Sales of season passes, including our Peak Pass, which allows for unlimited access to 14 of our resorts across the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, were up 20.8% on a unit basis and 19.8% on a dollar basis over the prior year, inclusive of Snow Time pass sales in both periods. Pass sales momentum has continued and we are well positioned heading into what we believe will be yet another great winter season in 2019-20. We see clear signs that our season pass offerings have become the leading choice for skiers and riders who make the East Coast their home.

“With a strong finish to the 2018-19 season and strong season pass sales for the upcoming 2019-20 season, Peak Resorts is positioned for further growth in fiscal 2020. We are already working on roughly $3.5 million in snowmaking upgrades at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, and expect to see a full year of benefit from our recently awarded liquor license at Whitetail and our continued efforts to enhance our food and beverage operations. We also expect to see further benefits from investments in our resorts, including at Mount Snow, Hunter and more recently at Hidden Valley. Looking at the summer and fall seasons, we expect to benefit from a packed event schedule that will leverage our amazing resorts to generate revenue during our seasonally slow periods, including food and beer festivals, concerts, outdoor entertainment events and on-mountain activities such as zip lining and mountain biking.”

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 fourth quarter revenue increased 52.5% year over year to $85.5 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time for the full quarter as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 11.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded an 81.1% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 34.4% rise in food and beverage revenue and 57.8% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter rose 33.6% year over year to $42.7 million due to the addition of Snow Time in the quarter as the Company managed its labor and other expenses in-line with its expectations. Power and utilities expenses were up 21.1% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity. Other operating expenses increased during the quarter due to the inclusion of the Snow Time resorts and organic spending on IT projects, repairs and maintenance and insurance costs. General and administrative expenses were up 184.3% to $4.7 million driven primarily by increased compensation expense as a result of the Company’s strong fiscal 2019 fourth quarter performance and additional professional service fees associated with the Snow Time acquisition.

Reported EBITDA for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 was $36.9 million, compared to $21.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The 71.5% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of operations from Snow Time as well as organic growth of roughly 14.3% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of April 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $30.2 million and total outstanding debt of $229.8 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and short and long-term debt of $217.4 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts exited fiscal 2019 positioned for further growth as we continue to integrate the Snow Time resorts and benefit from improved operations and greater scale across our resort portfolio. Our operating teams remain focused on managing costs and driving increased efficiency and enhanced profitability across each area of our business even as we maintain our commitment of providing the highest level of guest service possible.

“As our attention turns to fiscal 2020 and beyond, we believe we have the needed financial flexibility to continue to improve existing operations while also exploring opportunities to drive cash flow and improve our capital structure. With our focus on the continued improvement across the entirety of our business, we are excited by what the future holds and for the opportunities ahead.”

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

April 30, Year ended

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,987 4,273 4,704 (3,962 ) Interest expense, net 4,505 3,586 15,788 13,322 Depreciation and amortization 6,077 3,553 19,618 13,231 Acquisition related costs 419 - 1,045 - Restructuring and impairment charges - 549 190 2,135 Other income (90 ) (43 ) (159 ) (160 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (83 ) (83 ) (333 ) (333 ) Reported EBITDA $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2019 third quarter as summarized below:

*See page 3 for Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results and our good start to the 2018-19 ski season, given variable weather patterns and at times challenging conditions across the Northeast and Midwest. By combining our healthy organic growth with the addition of the three Snow Time resorts to our operating base beginning in late November, as well as our ongoing efforts to diligently manage expenses, Peak Resorts was able to overcome these challenges and generate revenue, net income and Reported EBITDA growth of 42%, 48% and 46% in the fiscal 2019 third quarter, respectively.

“Organic revenue and Reported EBITDA both grew roughly 10% in the 2019 fiscal third quarter, largely driven by the two major projects that debuted for the 2018-19 season. Mount Snow benefited from the new Carinthia Base Lodge, which dramatically expanded on-mountain services at the resort and provided a very popular parking, mountain access and après ski destination for our guests. Snowmaking investments at Mount Snow also allowed us to offer guests the predictable and stable conditions they have come to expect, despite variable weather throughout the quarter. Hunter Mountain also saw healthy visitation growth driven by the Hunter North terrain expansion, which has improved guest flows across the mountain and increased uphill capacity and parking access.

“The benefits of the Snow Time acquisition, which closed just before the start of the 2018-19 ski season in late November, are already evident as our three newest resorts delivered good financial performance despite a slightly later start to their seasons as a result of warm early winter temperatures. Through the addition of Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, we have diversified our business, allowing us to deliver improved financial performance across all conditions thanks to our broad geographic base, attractive amenities and our increasingly popular Peak Pass.

“Peak Pass sales for the 2019-20 season began last week as we continue to deliver on our promise to provide enhanced value and unlimited mountain access, including additional resorts for next season and flat pricing through the April 30 early season window. Adding the three Snow Time resorts to the pass for the first time further expands skiing and riding options for our guests which, combined with its attractive price point, should allow the Peak Pass to take additional market share as more Northeast and Midwest guests see the value of an unlimited, multi-mountain offering. We believe the Peak Pass is unmatched in the industry and we look forward to welcoming new and returning guests this summer and into the 2019-20 season and beyond.

“Peak Resorts has never been better positioned to grow our business and enhance value for our shareholders. Peak Pass sales grew at double-digit rates for the 2018-19 ski season as the pass benefits from increased visibility and growing acceptance across a broader geographic area, including some of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our on-mountain additions such as the Carinthia Base Lodge and the Hunter North terrain have greatly improved the guest experience. Ongoing efforts to enhance snowmaking across our mountain portfolio allow us to deliver great skiing and riding conditions even when Mother Nature does not cooperate. And the addition of Snow Time has favorably scaled up our business. The future is bright for Peak Resorts and we look forward to finishing out the 2018-19 ski season.”

Fiscal Third Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenue increased 41.7% year over year to $84.0 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time beginning on November 26, 2018 as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 9.7% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded a 54.4% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 45.5% rise in food and beverage revenue and 44.1% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 third quarter rose 36.3% year over year to $49.0 million, with the 28.6% increase in labor expenses driven by the addition of Snow Time’s operations and offset in part by lower labor expenses at the Company’s same-store resorts as a result of the Attitash Hotel closure and efforts to manage staffing levels to combat minimum wage increases. Power and utilities expenses were up 51.9% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity at Mount Snow and Hunter, in particular, to refresh terrain following warmer temperature cycles. Other operating expenses in the quarter included higher insurance costs, new groomer leases and increased sales commissions. General and administrative expenses were up 145.5% to $3.3 million driven primarily by the addition of Snow Time, one-time acquisition-related expenses and increased performance-driven compensation expenses.

Reported EBITDA for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 was $30.7 million, compared to $21.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The 46.0% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA included the addition of Snow Time beginning in November 2018 as well as organic growth of roughly 9.6% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of January 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $27.2 million and total outstanding debt of $230.6 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and long-term debt of $218.2 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts remains in a very healthy financial position as the tireless efforts of our mountain operations teams allowed the Company to drive efficiencies across the business and enhance our profitability in the 2019 fiscal third quarter and going forward. Furthermore, we have added Snow Time’s three mountain operations to our business and are already benefitting from the enhanced scale even as we plan for further efforts to drive additional synergies in the coming quarter. In addition, with the major capital investments at Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain now behind us, our capital expenditure needs will decline going forward, allowing Peak Resorts to further improve its balance sheet and cash flow.

“As we wrap up the 2018-19 ski season, we are confident that Peak Resorts’ financial flexibility will allow us to continue our efforts to invest in and improve existing operations while exploring further opportunities to scale up the business through acquisition. We are excited by what the future holds for Peak Resorts and our shareholders and the entire team remains committed to exceeding our guests’ high expectations for value, access and service.”

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

January 31, Nine months ended

January 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income (loss) $ 13,631 $ 9,181 $ (9,167 ) $ (8,328 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 5,574 3,433 (3,283 ) (8,235 ) Interest expense, net 4,458 3,529 11,283 9,736 Depreciation and amortization 6,809 3,379 13,541 9,678 Restructuring and impairment charges - 1,586 190 1,586 Acquisition related costs 295 - 626 - Other income (22 ) (28 ) (69 ) (117 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (84 ) (84 ) (250 ) (250 ) Reported EBITDA* $ 30,661 $ 20,996 $ 12,871 $ 4,070

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Snow Time Season Pass Upgrade Results Demonstrate the Strong Appeal of the Unlimited Peak Pass

WILDWOOD, Mo., Nov. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peak Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, announced today that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of Snow Time, Inc. (“Snow Time”). Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Peak Resorts paid approximately $70 million in cash consideration to Snow Time and issued approximately 1.18 million shares of its common stock to Snow Time’s shareholders at a price of $5.07 per share, for total consideration of approximately $76.0 million. Financing for the cash portion of the purchase price consists of: a $50 million, two-year senior secured term loan from CAP 1 LLC, which will accrue interest at an annual rate of 6.95% and carry no prepayment penalty; and $20 million in proceeds from the sale of 20,000 shares of Series A cumulative convertible preferred stock and issuance of accompanying warrants to CAP 1 LLC pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement.

The Company also announced today that through October 31, 2018, Snow Time pass sales increased by approximately 20% on a unit basis and by approximately 19% on a revenue basis, compared to the prior year. Approximately 27% of Snow Time season pass holders took advantage of the Company’s buy-up offer and upgraded to the Peak Pass.

“We are delighted to kick off the winter season by welcoming Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop to the Peak Resorts family following the completion of our acquisition of Snow Time,” said Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer of Peak Resorts. “Our entire team is excited to begin working with the Naylor family’s three beautiful resorts as we look to build on their legacy and further elevate the guest experience while introducing the Peak Pass and our other resorts to skiers across the Mid-Atlantic. The addition of the Snow Time properties to our growing portfolio of Northeast and Midwest operations further expands our reach into the affluent and densely populated Baltimore and Washington D.C. markets and provides our customers in the Northeast with three new complementary and conveniently located mountains where they can ski and ride as well as enjoy a four season resort experience.

“We have also seen strong acceptance for the Peak Pass as demonstrated by the 27% of Snow Time pass holders who elected to trade-up to our unlimited pass offering through October 31. We are very pleased that Snow Time’s season pass holders are upgrading to the Peak Pass at such healthy levels, reflecting what we believe is their excitement to have an opportunity to ski at their home resort while also exploring the Catskills in New York, the Green Mountains in Vermont and the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Since introducing the Peak Pass, our goal has been to provide an unlimited pass for all ages that offers unmatched value for guests who live within driving distance of our resorts and visit us frequently throughout the season. We believe this goal is a key driver of our success and we look forward to a great 2018/2019 ski season.”

As of today, the company will operate under the name Stabilis Energy, Inc. and its common stock will commence trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “SLNG”.

“Stabilis is pleased to complete this transaction with AETI,” commented James Reddinger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stabilis. “We believe that this transaction positions Stabilis to become a leading North American small-scale LNG production and distribution company. We will focus on consolidating existing LNG assets, as well as investing in new assets in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

About Stabilis Energy, Inc.

Stabilis Energy, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of small-scale liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production, distribution and fueling services to multiple end markets in North America. Stabilis has safely delivered over 200 million gallons of LNG through more than 20,000 truck deliveries during its 15-year operating history in the LNG industry, which it believes makes it one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America. Stabilis’ customers use LNG as a fuel source in a variety of applications in the industrial, energy, mining, utilities and pipelines, commercial, and high horsepower transportation markets. Stabilis’ customers use LNG as an alternative to traditional fuel sources, such as distillate fuel oil and propane, to lower fuel costs and reduce harmful environmental emissions. Stabilis’ customers also use LNG as a “virtual pipeline” solution when natural gas pipelines are not available or volumes are curtailed. Stabilis Energy, Inc. is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

This trial will enroll approximately 40 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with r/r MCL or r/r DLBCL. This trial will also explore the biologic predictors of response and resistance to dual B-cell receptor (BCR) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. Janssen Biotech, Inc. is providing ibrutinib as part of the study, with Xynomic providing abexinostat and funding support for the trial being conducted at MSK.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has an annual incidence of approximately 6,500 in G7 countries, according to DR/Decision Resources, LLC. Ibrutinib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsed MCL and has response rates of 60-70% and median duration of response of 18 months. Abexinostat as a mono therapy has been shown to have response rate of 15.4% (7.7% complete response and 7.7% partial response) in r/r MCL patients. Researchers at MSK are testing whether abexinostat/ibrutinib combo could potentially improve response rates and duration of responses in r/r MCL patients, subject to the assessment upon the completion of the trial.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) subtype according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). Researchers at MSK have shown preclinical data demonstrating that dual targeting of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in the BCR pathway with ibrutinib and inhibition of MyD88-driven NF-kB activation with a HDAC inhibitor lead to synergistic anti-lymphoma activity in MyD88 mutated, ABC-subtype DLBCL both in vitro and in vivo.

Abexinostat is a novel HDAC inhibitor in global pivotal trials against NHL and renal cell carcinoma. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class BTK inhibitor jointly developed and commercialized as IMBRUVICA® by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company and has been approved for multiple hematological malignances and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD).

Our investigation concerns whether Yangtze has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated.” The Hindenburg report described Yangtze as “a scheme run by its Chairman & controlling shareholder to siphon money away from U.S. public markets.” Among other allegations, the Hindenburg report asserted that Yangtze’s “only operating entity has been declared insolvent in China and is involved in multiple undisclosed legal proceedings” and, citing “government-sourced documents and interviews with local officials, we believe that at least 77% of the company’s reported assets are fabricated.”

On this news, Yangtze’s share price fell by more than 28%, closing at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced in a recent Form 6-K report that on September 4, 2019, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company stating that The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market.



The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting. Additionally, as of the date of this release, the Company continues to make progress with the completion of its delinquent annual report and intends to file these reports with the SEC. The Company intends to complete and file its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as soon as possible with the SEC. Thereafter, the Company intends to work with a market maker to file a Form 211 with FINRA to enable the Company’s shares to begin trading on the over-the-counter markets.

“While there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to execute its plan. If the shares resume trading on the over-the-counter markets, the shares may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on Nasdaq. While trading on the over-the-counter-markets the Company expects to apply for a Nasdaq listing at a future time.” concluded Mr. Liu.

(NASDAQ: CCIH) on Behalf of ChinaCache Stockholders and Encourages ChinaCache Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, May 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is investigating potential claims against ChinaCache International Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: CCIH) on behalf of ChinaCache stockholders. Our investigation concerns whether ChinaCache has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



Click here to participate in the action.

On April 29, 2019, ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for the 2018 fiscal year. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (“Chairman”), Song Wang (“Wang”), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

On May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019 because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the “NASDAQ Letter”). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache’s engagement of its new independent auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

(the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions. Engaged Capital and certain of its affiliates, collectively holding nearly 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, have entered into voting agreements committing them to, among other things and subject to its terms, vote in favor of adopting the acquisition agreement.

“Over the course of our review, the Committee evaluated a full range of strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives to best serve the interests of our stockholders. After a thorough process, including considering Del Frisco’s current operations and future prospects, the Committee and the Board is confident that this transaction offers the most promising opportunity to realize the highest value for our stockholders,” said Joe Reece, Committee Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“In consultation with our outside advisors, the Board has been evaluating several strategic and financial alternative options since December 2018. This transaction offers immediate liquidity at a significant premium for our stockholders while providing the best path forward for our Del Frisco’s brands, our employees, and loyal guests,” said Ian R. Carter, Board Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“L Catterton brings a distinguished track record of fostering the growth and success of world class experiential brands. Together with their deep operational expertise in the restaurant industry, I am confident L Catterton will be a great long-term partner,” said Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

Del Frisco’s comprises four leading brands across two distinct business lines -- Del Frisco’s Grille and Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in the steak and grill category, and bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar in the upscale regionally-inspired cuisine category. Upon the close of the transaction, L Catterton plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar businesses separately from the steakhouse brands in order to nurture the unique attributes of the brands.

“At L Catterton, we bring more than just capital – we bring significant operational expertise to our investments,” said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. “Over the last 30 years, L Catterton has invested in nearly 30 restaurant concepts globally to create a number of industry leaders. Del Frisco’s has four outstanding brands in two distinct and attractive categories – upscale regionally-inspired cuisine, and steak and grill. We’re excited to partner with the Company to harness the power of these brands by operating the upscale regionally-inspired brands separately from the steak and grill concepts.”

L Catterton has invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin' Brands Inc. (including Outback Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill), CÉ LA VI, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Crystal Jade, Culinary Concepts by Jean-Georges, P.F. Chang's, Uncle Julio’s and many more.

Piper Jaffray & Co. acted as financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal counsel to Del Frisco’s and its Board of Directors. Credit Suisse served as financial advisor and Gibson Dunn LLP served as legal advisor to L Catterton.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results","IRVING, Texas, Aug. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 25, 2019.



On June 24, 2019, Del Frisco’s announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton, a consumer-focused private equity firm, will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.

The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by the Board with the assistance of the Board’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

In view of the pending transaction, Del Frisco’s has withdrawn its fiscal year 2019 guidance and long-term outlook and will not host a conference call to discuss these second quarter 2019 financial results.

Key Highlights from the 13-Week Second Quarter 2019 Compared to the 13-Week Second Quarter 2018 Include:

Consolidated revenues increased 73.9% to $131.7 million from $75.7 million due primarily to $21.1 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $28.2 million in contributions from bartaco.



Total comparable restaurant sales increased 0.5%.

GAAP net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.



Adjusted net loss* of $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income* of $3.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.



GAAP operating loss of $0.6 million, compared to GAAP operating loss of $3.0 million

Adjusted EBITDA* increased 60.3% to $13.1 million from $8.2 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 10.0% from 10.8%.



Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased 74.9% to $28.3 million from $16.2 million due primarily to $5.2 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $6.9 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 21.5% from 21.4%. Sequentially, restaurant-level EBITDA margin improved 260 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2019.

* Adjusted net loss/income, adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP net income and operating (loss)/income, respectively, and a discussion of why we consider them useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.

Review of Second Quarter 2019 Operating Results

Consolidated revenues increased $56.0 million, or 73.9%, to $131.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $75.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. All results exclude any contributions from Sullivan’s Steakhouse, which was sold in the third quarter of 2018, and which sale is reflected as discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2018. The increase is due primarily to $21.1 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $28.2 million in contributions from bartaco, which were acquired on June 27, 2018.

Comparable Restaurant Sales

General and administrative costs increased to $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2018. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, general and administrative costs increased to 13.0% from 10.5%.

Non-GAAP Measures

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted EBIDTA and restaurant-level EBITDA. Adjusted net (loss) income represents GAAP net loss plus the sum of GAAP income tax expense (benefit), lease termination and closing costs, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, reorganization severance, non-recurring legal expenses, donations, non-recurring corporate expenses, and discontinued operations minus income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 68% during 2019, and (52)% during 2018. We believe that this non-GAAP operating measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors as it excludes certain non-operating related expenditures. Adjusted EBIDTA is calculated by adding back to operating income, pre-opening costs, donations, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, non-recurring legal costs, reorganization severance, lease termination and closing costs, and depreciation and amortization. Restaurant-level EBITDA is calculated by adding back to adjusted EBIDTA general and administrative expenses. We believe that these operating measures also represent useful internal measures of performance. Restaurant-level EBITDA margin represents restaurant-level EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. Adjusted net (loss) income per share represents income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on divestitures and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe that this measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors.

Accordingly, we include these non-GAAP measures so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing our underlying performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these measures as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP measurements. The following tables include a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and operating income to restaurant-level EBITDA.

Recast 2018 Financial Information

The unaudited combined adjusted financial information for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended June 26, 2018 in the following tables represent information derived from financial statements prepared by the former management of Barteca (""Barcelona and bartaco Brands""), recast to align with our fiscal calendar, and historical recast financial information of Del Frisco's Heritage Brands, which represent Double Eagle and Grille, prior to the Barteca Acquisition. This unaudited combined adjusted financial information has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s results of operations actually would have been had the Barteca Acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited combined adjusted financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or results of operations of the combined company and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved from the combined operations.

Adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted EBITDA and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. See the discussion above under ""Non-GAAP Measures"" regarding how we define these measures and why we believe they are useful for investors.

Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended (Amounts in thousands) June 25, 2019 June 26, 2018(1) June 25, 2019 June 26, 2018(2) Operating income $ (608 ) $ (7,539 ) $ (12,422 $ (4,949 ) Add: Pre-opening costs 1,301 1,892 4,050 3,303 General and administrative costs 17,117 20,631 33,489 31,888 Donations 163 16 195 58 Consulting project costs 3,450 621 7,954 854 Acquisition costs — 5,462 — 6,070 Reorganization severance 480 — 777 113 Lease termination and closing costs (1,754 ) 589 1,154 591 Depreciation and amortization 8,144 6,206 15,795 12,030 Restaurant-level EBITDA $ 28,293 $ 27,878 $ 50,992 $ 49,958 Insurance settlement (Barteca) pre acquisition(3) $ (601 ) $ (1,190 ) Adjusted Restaurant-level EBITDA $ 28,293 $ 27,277 $ 50,992 $ 48,768

Recast amounts for the 13 weeks ended June 26, 2018 include historical amounts for Barcelona and bartaco Brands, which were acquired during the third quarter of 2018, prior to acquisition. Recast amounts for the 26 weeks ended June 26, 2018 include historical amounts for Barcelona and bartaco Brands, which were acquired during the third quarter of 2018, prior to acquisition. Prior to the Barteca Acquisition, starting in Q4 of 2017 and continuing through the first half of 2018, Barteca management recognized insurance settlement proceeds from a location-specific incident as a reduction to restaurant operating expenses, which therefore increased restaurant-level EBITDA margins by the amount of those proceeds for that period of time. Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company. Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

II-VI has agreed with SAMR that it will operate separately, for a period expected to be three years, the wavelength selective switch business of Finisar. The clearance decision from SAMR satisfies the closing condition set forth in the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger regarding the receipt of antitrust approvals. II-VI expects the closing of its acquisition of Finisar (the “Merger”) to occur on or about September 24, 2019.



In accordance with the merger agreement governing the Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), holders of Finisar common stock and holders of certain restricted stock units issued by Finisar (collectively, the “Voting Securities”) have previously been provided the opportunity to elect the form of Merger consideration they wished to receive for each Voting Security they hold, being either (i) $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration”). The deadline for that election was July 15, 2019 (the “Election Deadline”), and the total amount of cash and II-VI Common Stock to be paid in the aggregate by II-VI is fixed. Holders of Voting Securities are deemed to have made no election if they failed to make an election, or revoked a prior election without making a new election, by the Election Deadline, or if their election materials were not received in proper form by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”) prior to the Election Deadline.

Holders of Voting Securities who made no election, or have validly withdrawn their election, are deemed to have elected the Mixed Consideration. Holders of Voting Securities who have validly made, and not previously withdrawn, an election prior to the Election Deadline regarding the form of merger consideration they wish to receive in the Merger will have until 5:00 p.m., New York time, on September 20, 2019 to withdraw their election if they wish to receive the Mixed Consideration. All other holders of Voting Securities who have validly made an election that is not so withdrawn will receive either the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration they have elected, in each case prorated as described below.

The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to automatic proration so that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of II-VI Common Stock paid to all holders of Voting Securities as a group will not change as a result of these elections.
