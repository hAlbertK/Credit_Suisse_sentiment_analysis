The rapidly expanding world of esports has a new publicly traded company, one that’s hoping to learn from the business model of another online gaming predecessor: poker.

Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. has agreed to purchase Allied Esports International Inc., an esports entertainment company, and WPT Enterprises, the creator of the World Poker Tour, from Ourgame International Holdings Ltd. for about $150 million. The new company, called Allied Esports Entertainment Inc., will have an initial enterprise value of about $214 million and trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol AESE.

The aim is to bring the World Poker Tour’s business model for live events and media distribution to the burgeoning world of competitive video gaming, which is projected to grow to a $1.7 billion industry by 2021. The new company plans to operate venues, sell the content generated by those events, and then move viewers onto a new online tournament platform to be launched in 2020.

“There’s a gap in monetization in esports right now,” Black Ridge Chairman Ken DeCubellis, who will be chief financial officer of the new company. “It’s a big buzzword, but the main way companies and investors are approaching esports is by investing in the game publishers or acquiring the teams that compete. We see an opportunity to monetize the viewership right now.”

There are 40 million people playing online poker globally, according to DeCubellis. By contrast, there are 2.2 billion video gamers, with 380 million viewers of global esports contests.

“Esports is such a bigger market,” DeCubellis said. “And the growth rates are so much higher.”

Black Ridge is a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, an entity with no assets that raises money to fund a future purchase. Sponsored by Black Ridge Oil & Gas Inc., it completed its initial public offering in October 2017, raising $138 million in cash proceeds.

Under the terms of the deal Black Ridge is issuing $118 million worth of shares to Ourgame, plus about $35 million.

The transaction is expected to close in the first few months of 2019. At that point Black Ridge will be renamed Allied Esports Entertainment and its ticker symbol will change.

The entire Black Ridge team will move to the new company. It’s a group with gaming experience, including Lyle Berman, who is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame, and a longtime poker executive. Frank Ng, chief executive officer of Ourgame, is also stepping down to take the same role in the new company.

“This will be a very powerful ecosystem,” Ng said.

The network of Allied Esports venues includes facilities in Las Vegas and Hamburg, as well as Beijing and Shenzen in China. The company operates a pair of traveling venues built on 18-wheeler trucks and has launched a program to help partner with groups looking to build their own stadiums around the world.

The World Poker Tour has used Allied’s Las Vegas venue in the past, and will continue to do so. The merger into an esports company won’t affect the brand’s poker operations, Ng said, but the group’s network will be used to help model the new tournament and streaming platform.

The new group plans to invest $100 million in the next three years to expand the venues, adding six more trucks and almost quadruple its number of affiliates to 26.

James Hackett is taking back the reins at Alta Mesa Resources Inc., the Oklahoma-focused shale producer that’s seen its market value drop from nearly $4 billion to less than $500 million. The shares soared as much as 29 percent in response.

The former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. chief executive has spent the past year as Alta Mesa’s chairman. Now, Hackett will take over the company’s helm, replacing Harlan Chappelle as CEO on an interim basis. Hackett, 64, said a series of “disappointments” left him feeling as if he had let investors down.

“I feel very spiritually inclined to do well,” Hackett, who left his post at Anadarko to attend Harvard Divinity School, said in an interview. “And that’s something we haven’t done at this company.”

Hackett attributes part of the company’s struggle over the past year to sector-wide challenges. The S&P 500 Energy Index has sunk 42 percent since peaking in mid-2014, while the broader S&P 500 index has gained 26 percent over the same period. But he also cites Alta Mesa’s inability to operate efficiently and a steep learning curve when it came to drilling in Oklahoma.

In August 2017, Hackett acquired Alta Mesa Holdings LP, a closely held independent producer in Oklahoma’s Stack play, and Kingfisher Midstream LLC, a pipeline company, via a blank-check company he formed with backing from private-equity firm Riverstone Holdings. At the time, the company was valued at about $3.8 billion.

In addition to Hackett, a group of three industry veterans from private equity advisory firm Meridian Energy LLC are joining Alta Mesa. Randy Limbacher, former CEO of closely held Samson Resources Co., has become president, with Mark Castiglione, previously a senior vice president at Quantum Resources LLC, as his chief of staff. John Campbell, who served as the chief operating officer at Quantum, is the new COO of upstream at Alta Mesa.

The management change will help turn things around for the company, said Derrick Whitfield, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in a telephone interview. The new leadership effectively wipes out concerns that the company will one day be forced to declare bankruptcy, he said.

“The debt guys were starting to circle around” Alta Mesa, Whitfield said. But with Hackett and his new team, “this is not a going concern now.”

“There’s absolutely no way they’d be tying themselves to a bankruptcy,” Whitfield said.

Oklahoma Optimism

Hackett said the company understands how to better space wells, among other operational challenges that had irritated analysts and investors who were promised a quick ramp-up in output. “We’re still very optimistic about what this part of the Stack can yield,” he said.

And while the lowest oil prices in more than a year will certainly provide a new hurdle as Hackett takes back control, he said he’s ready.

“I’m happy to do it again,” said Hackett, who will continue taking the Vonlane luxury bus to Austin once a week to teach a class at the University of Texas on moral leadership in economics. “I think the team that resigned felt they had enough time.”

Shockwaves in the c-suites of shale companies are showing investor frustration with an industry that continues to outspend cash flow.

Independent drillers such as Alta Mesa Resources Inc. and Centennial Resource Development Inc., whose leaders were once rewarded for amassing vast portfolios of drilling rights, are now being punished for failing to convert those holdings into profits. Even bigger players, like Pioneer Natural Resources Co. are feeling the heat.

Crude prices have never fully recovered from the 2014-2016 slump and investors have soured on the sector, undermining explorers dependent on regular cash infusions to finance drilling. In the past week alone, two prominent shale bosses departed their companies and a third saw his creation lose about 75 percent of its value. Meanwhile activist investors are beating the doors of at least 10 American drillers, urging management teams and directors to retire or sell out.

“Although the whole shale revolution appears to be quite powerful, if you look just under the hood, you see that every company has to run faster and faster to achieve growth,” shale pioneer and Centennial Chief Executive Officer Mark Papa said on a conference call Tuesday after releasing disappointing production numbers.

Activist Pressure

Centennial, which focuses on the Permian Basin that straddles West Texas and New Mexico, was created on the back of investors’ trust in Papa, 72, who built EOG Resources Inc. into what’s now the world’s second-largest independent oil producer by market value. Centennial tumbled Tuesday -- the shares are now down about 27 percent for the week -- after cutting the number of rigs it plans to deploy this year and pushing back the date for when it plans to stop outspending its cash flow.

Other high-profile figures in shale have fared even worse. On Feb. 21, Floyd Wilson, a wildcatter famed for the $10.5 billion sale of Petrohawk Energy Corp. to BHP Group, was ousted as CEO of Halcon Resources Corp. as activist investor pressure mounted after the company struggled to find enough cash to drill its leases. On the same day, Pioneer said it was bringing back founder Scott Sheffield to replace Tim Dove as CEO.

And on Monday, Alta Mesa Resources Inc., run by former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. CEO Jim Hackett, said it will take a writedown of about $3.1 billion because of a ""material weakness"" in its financial reporting. That sent its shares plunging as much as 69 percent and left its bonds trading at distressed levels.

""Expectations are high for operational execution and, as we’ve seen recently, the margin for error is often razor thin with little forgiveness from an investor base that is wondering if the underlying value proposition of the industry has more material issues,"" Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts said Wednesday in a note.

Parent-Child

Perhaps the biggest challenge for these companies is how close to one another oil wells can be drilled. If spaced too tightly, newer wells -- “child wells” -- can be less prolific than the “parent.” But too far apart and drillers risk leaving oil in the ground. It’s a serious problem that affects companies’ capital efficiency, said Brandon Myers, a Houston-based analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

“The issue for the entire Permian Basin relates to parent-child wells,” Papa said on the call. “Companies are going to have to pedal harder every year to get the kind of growth that perhaps they’ve been promising.""

“You’re getting data points every quarter from companies where they talk about, ‘Gee whiz, I thought I could drill 1,000 wells on my acreage and it turns out I can only drill 600 wells on my acreage’ because of, essentially, parent-child issues,"" he added.

Bigger companies are less at risk because they have more land to drill. But smaller publicly traded players and those backed by private equity typically drill more marginal locations in an effort to prove they have oil, with a view to selling the lease later on. With investors demanding immediate returns, some operators have had to switch to production mode, pitching them into direct competition with larger rivals for capital and services such as drilling and pumping.

For Alta Mesa, optimistic production targets proved unattainable. Created by Hackett in a three-way merger completed last year, the company’s operations are located in a lesser-known section of the Stack oil basin in Oklahoma. While that initially offered the promise of cheaper acreage, the company repeatedly missed production forecasts. Hackett took back the reins in December after its market value dropped from $3.8 billion to less than $500 million.

""The rocks are the rocks, and it doesn’t matter whose name is on it,"" said Subash Chandra, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC. ""If the assets are mediocre, $50 oil is a major problem.""

In the northeast, gas driller EQT Corp.’s challenges with well spacing are partially behind a battle with the founders of a company it acquired in 2017. With the backing of major investors including D.E. Shaw & Co., brothers Toby and Derek Rice have been urging directors to depose the current CEO and install Toby Rice in his place, among other operational changes. Laredo Petroleum Inc. and Matador Resources Co. have also faced questions about how they space wells.

“We’re at a point now where operators are really resetting expectations, and they’re taking corrective measures,” said Shak Ahmed, a research analyst at RS Energy Group. “We expect that to actually improve results going forward, but it’s obviously a pretty painful process getting to that point.”

Photographer: Brittany Sowacke/Bloomberg Photographer: Brittany Sowacke/Bloomberg

Three years on from a slump in the oil market, prices are back up again and the U.S. has become the world’s largest producer. Yet the pain continues for some companies.

The boom in American shale output risks masking ongoing woes at a number of lower-tier explorers, as well as some oilfield servicers. Energy-related bankruptcies this year are trailing only those in the discretionary consumer goods sector, according to Bloomberg data. And some companies are warning of more stress ahead.

Weatherford International Plc, once one of the top providers of oil-well drilling and completion, last week said it was preparing to file for bankruptcy. Shale explorers Halcon Resources Corp. and Alta Mesa Resources Inc. have raised doubts about their ability to stay afloat. Bonds of producer California Resources Corp. are trading at yields of more than 10 percentage points above benchmark U.S. Treasuries, meeting a common definition of distressed debt.

These ailing companies reveal the flip side of the boom. High-cost producers with poor balance sheets are not getting much love from investors who are more focused on demanding returns than pouring more money into shale’s expansion, whether through debt or equity. And as producers rein in spending, the less-efficient service providers are struggling.

""There hasn’t been the institutional stomach, either at the debt level or the equity level, to go through the open-heart surgery that involves a bankruptcy,"" Patrick Hughes, a partner at law firm Haynes and Boone LLP, said in a phone interview. ""It takes a long time for the boards of these companies to really realize this may be the only way they can clean up the balance sheet.""

Weatherford said in a response to questions on Tuesday that it’s undergoing a “balance sheet” restructuring to address the company’s debt burden, and that this is “not a restructuring of operations, nor is it a declaration of bankruptcy.”

Halcon and California Resources didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. Alta Mesa declined to comment.

Bankruptcies Poised to Rebound This Year? Oil and gas bankruptcy debt hit 4-year low in 2018 Source: Haynes and Boone LLP

Crude’s 40% rebound since late December -- to about $60 a barrel in the U.S. and $70 elsewhere in the world -- wasn’t enough to prevent debt-burdened Bristow Group Inc. and PHI Inc., providers of helicopter services to offshore explorers, as well as producers Jones Energy Inc. and Rex Energy Corp., from filing for bankruptcy this year.

And making it tougher for the service providers are exploration customers who continue to hold the line on spending, with U.S. outlays expected to be down about 10 percent from last year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

""A lot of people see the $60 or $70 and assume everything is great,"" Spencer Cutter, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a phone interview. ""I think 2019 is going to be a bigger year for bankruptcies than 2018.""

The casualties from the downturn peaked in 2016, when 142 companies filed with $70.3 billion in debt, according to Haynes and Boone. That number shrunk by more than half to 41 companies filing with $17.2 billion in debt in 2018.

This year, a Weatherford bankruptcy alone would add about $8 billion of debt to the tally. It would be the biggest wreckage in the industry in four years. In the case of Halcon, going under would be a repeat of a previous bankruptcy. Halcon’s 6.75% bonds maturing in 2025 are trading at less than half their face value and are rated CC by S&P Global Ratings, a level that signals the company will likely fail to meet some of its obligations.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Weatherford signed a restructuring agreement with holders of about 62% of its senior unsecured notes to facilitate a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing. The agreement calls for holders of $7.4 billion in senior unsecured debt to receive 99% of the common equity of the restructured company as well as up to $1.25 billion in new unsecured notes. With over $2.3 billion in holdings, Franklin Resources was by far the largest holder of the company’s unsecured debt at the end of March, according to Bloomberg data.

Meanwhile, equity issuance for U.S. energy companies in the first quarter fell to the lowest level this decade and bond sales dropped more than a third from a year earlier, according to industry consultant Drilling Info.

""Sixty-dollar oil is good if you’re a low-cost producer without a ton of debt in the Permian or maybe the Bakken or one of the better basins,"" BI’s Cutter said. ""It’s ok if you’re a mid-tier, and it’s not so good if you’re third tier.""

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. has agreed to buy U.S. supercomputer maker Cray Inc. in a deal valued at about $1.4 billion as the firm works to become more competitive in high-end computing.

Cray investors will get $35 a share in cash, the companies said in a statement on Friday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg report. That represents a premium of about 17% above Thursday’s closing price. The deal values Cray at $1.3 billion net of cash, the firms said in the statement.

Cray jumped 17% to $34.89 at 9:49 a.m. in New York trading after earlier touching $34.96, the biggest intraday gain in a year. Palo Alto-based HP Enterprise gained about 2% to $14.82.

The deal will help HP Enterprise strengthen its position against International Business Machines Corp. It could also become HP Enterprise’s biggest since it started trading in 2015, surpassing its acquisition of Nimble Storage Inc. for about $1 billion more than two years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

HP Enterprise has mostly been paring down since it was created from the breakup of Hewlett-Packard Co. In 2017, it completed a spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corp. It’s also separated some software assets in an $8.8 billion deal with U.K.-based Micro Focus International Plc.

Still, the company has also committed $4 billion through 2022 to initiatives to develop artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and distributed computing offerings. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri, who succeeded Meg Whitman last year, said in November that HP Enterprise would start to see a return on that investment over the next two years.

Loss-making Cray traces its roots back to a company founded in 1972 by Seymour Cray, known as the “father of supercomputing.” This month, it signed a deal with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build a new $600 million system for research on artificial intelligence, weather, subatomic structures, genomics and physics.

HP Enterprise’s own high-end computer systems are used by the University of Notre Dame, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and chemical giant BASF SE, according to its website. Last year, it won a $57 million contract to provide supercomputers to the U.S. Department of Defense for helicopter design and weather forecasting.

Since 2015, when HP split into HPE (networking and consulting) and HP Inc. (PCs and printers), Neri has helped define the enterprise business’s scope, leading key acquisitions and the development of advanced servers while shuttering underperforming product lines.

What challenges do you see at this company as you look at how things are rapidly changing and moving to the cloud?

The cloud has to move closer and closer to where the data is being generated. It’s cheaper to move the cloud to where the data is, not the data where the cloud is, so we promised last year, at HPE Discover in Las Vegas, to invest $4 billion to develop that set of road maps and technologies.

How much pressure are you feeling from Google, Amazon.com, Microsoft, these big companies that have really put their stake in the cloud?

There’s no doubt that many of the workloads have moved to the public cloud. But big customers realize it’s cheaper for them to run things on their premises in their data center or in a sort of hybrid model. We believe that’s going to be the world as we go along, and there is a ton of opportunity to modernize that infrastructure and help customers decide what is the right mix.

Do you feel pressure, though, from some of the other competitors out there?

Well, listen, we’re competing with everybody, you know? We compete on one spectrum with the public cloud vendors, on the other spectrum with the equipment vendors. But we have a clear understanding and strategy. And if you look at our latest results, we’re making significant progress.

You guys have manufacturing in Mexico. You’re in 172 countries. How do you view the trade wars under way, and how might they affect you?

The situation we’re in creates uncertainty, and when there is uncertainty, customers tend to step back a little bit. Obviously, there needs to be a fair approach to trade, but we live in a global economy, and the supply chains we’ve put in place over the last few decades are complicated.

You’ve acquired a lot of companies, including a recent $1.4 billion deal for Cray Inc. Is there another piece you need to add on?

More and more intelligence comes through the security analytics that make infrastructure more autonomous. Valuations tend to be a little bit erratic of late, but if it makes sense, we’ll consider it.

There’s a lot of money out there in the world, especially in the private equity market. Anybody knocking on your door to maybe buy you?

No, not at all. We’re focused on executing our strategy and making this company relevant for the future, to become a trusted adviser to our customers. And I have to say, we’re having a ton of fun.

You’ve been at HPE for a quarter of a century. What’s the best advice you got from a mentor?

First, you have to have a clear vision for yourself, where you want to be, and establish clear milestones. Second, you have to deliver what you say. Build a network of people who will take an interest in you. And then, taking risk is important. Sometimes you have to move sideways to move upward.

The Trump administration’s latest assault on China is aimed at forestalling advances in super-computing: a sector with profound military and technology implications -- and one where the world’s No. 2 economy poses a credible threat to U.S. dominance.

Washington’s campaign to contain the ascendancy of a potential global rival has expanded beyond telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. to a quintet of Chinese enterprises that embody a nation’s effort to build ever-faster computers. Those ultra-powerful machines, which process calculations on an unimaginable scale, support critical fields from massive data-crunching to artificial intelligence.

On Friday, five Chinese entities joined Huawei on a blacklist that bars them from buying American technology, just days ahead of an important summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Washington raised national security concerns because their computers were developed for military uses or in cooperation with the Chinese military. At the same time, U.S. pressure could have the effect of crimping China’s high-performance computing effort, which has produced some of the world’s fastest machines.

“China’s HPC business development will slow down for sure for both technology and business. However, there are other vendors that will narrow the gap as long as they are not put onto the list,” said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst with Forrester Research.

Among the five was government-backed Sugon, which claims to be the country’s leader in supercomputer sales. It’s one of a coterie of increasingly aggressive supercomputer projects backed by Beijing that are winning credibility in a field pioneered by American names that have fallen on hard times. The storied but money-losing Cray Inc., for example, agreed this year to be acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.

“There’s a broader concern about what China is going to do with supercomputers, particularly when it comes to military applications,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at the Eurasia Group.

Another addition to Washington’s blacklist is Higon, which Commerce identified as a Sugon subsidiary and partners with the U.S. chip maker Advanced Micro Device Inc. in a Chinese joint venture. AMD uses that venture -- Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. -- to license microprocessor technology to clients such as Higon in the world’s biggest PC market. Lisa Su, AMD’s chief executive officer, told a recent conference in Taiwan that AMD would not license newer technologies to Chinese clients. The company said Friday it will comply with the order.

Higon in turn part-owns another two on Trump’s list: Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology. The fifth entity is the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, which Commerce said was owned by the People’s Liberation Army’s 56th Research Institute. That agency’s mission was “to support China’s military modernization,” according to Commerce.

Sugon itself is open about working with the Chinese government and hopes to “build a cloud data service network covering hundreds of cities and sectors to provide a wealth of intelligent applications and services for the government, industry and the general population,” according to its website. The U.S. however accused the company on Friday of being “involved in activities determined to be contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.”

“Sugon is pretty small, but it’s symbolic,” said Triolo. “You can argue there’s a clearer national security case with Sugon than with Huawei.”

Taking Sugon out of the equation will hamper but not kill Beijing’s supercomputing endeavors. While the company and its units claim to be the volume leader, there are other outfits considered more advanced technically. They include Inspur Ltd., a computer and cloud services provider with government ties, and a plethora of projects backed by prestigious institutions. Those include an advanced earth ecosystem simulator inside Tsinghua University capable of processing 100 tera-floating-point operations a second.

If “chipset makers in the U.S. stop the supply of product that Sugon has been largely relying on for its high performance computing business, the impact on Sugon’s HPC business will be fatal,” Dai said.

When last we left Alden Global Capital LLC and its 39-year-old managing partner, Heath Freeman, they had just purchased the Boston Herald, the struggling tabloid that competes with the Boston Globe. The $12 million purchase took place in March; within a week, to the surprise of absolutely no one, Alden Global announced that it would lay off a quarter of the staff.

This, of course, is Alden Global’s MO. It buys up newspapers — more than 90 so far — but unlike Jeff Bezos at the Washington Post, the firm isn’t doing it to revive them. Instead, it cuts and cuts, and then cuts some more, until there’s little left but a carcass. Speaking truth to power, the importance of the Fourth Estate to a functioning democracy, the idea of bearing witness — none of that matters to Freeman and his fellow hedgies at Alden Global. Their only goal is to suck out cash and redirect it elsewhere. At the Herald alone, those first layoffs were followed by more, until its staff has shrunk from 240 employees to about 100. No one thinks it’s done shrinking.

If Freeman spoke to the press — he never has, so far as I can tell — he would likely justify his strategy by saying that he was deploying the cash he generates from his newspaper pillaging for investments that can earn higher returns. Just one problem: Alden Global’s non-newspaper investments have done horribly. To judge from recent events, the hedge fund’s treatment of some of these holdings is as heartless as its treatment of its newspapers. We’re going to focus our attention today on those non-newspaper investments.

Alden Global was founded by a Wall Street billionaire named Randall Smith, whom the New York Post once labeled “the grandfather of vulture investing.” In 2007, Smith hired Freeman away from a more genteel firm, mentored him in the ruthless ways of vulture investing, and then handed Alden Global over to him.

Smith also owned a real estate development company, Spire Realty, that operated primarily in Texas. Among its holdings is Bryan Tower, a Dallas skyscraper that was built in the early 1970s by the great Texas developer Trammel Crow. Smith and his son Caleb, who is a partner at Spire Realty, renovated the tower shortly after buying it in 1998.

It’s now 20 years since the renovation, and the building is getting a little long in the tooth. Inevitably, tenants are starting to look for shinier quarters. Thus it was that last month, Baylor Scott & White Health Obligated Group, the largest health-care system in Texas — and the building’s biggest tenant — announced that it would be moving out in 2020 for a new headquarters building going up in one of the city’s hipper neighborhoods.

Within days, Morningstar Credit Rating put Bryan Tower on its “watch list,” citing the possibility that a $61.9 million loan might default. “Without Baylor’s rent, the property’s cash flow would decrease below breakeven and raise the risk of term default,” Morningstar warned.

Joe Ruff, Spire’s president, quickly responded that there was nothing to worry about. “We have no intentions of defaulting on the note,” he said, pointing out that that company was already in “talks” with a potential tenant “of similar size.”

In fact, Bryan Tower had already landed a tenant a few months earlier: privately held Payless ShoeSource Inc. The company, long based in Topeka, Kansas, went through bankruptcy in 2017. Upon emerging, it set about outsourcing its information technology department, laying off 235 employees, and putting its headquarters up for sale. When the Greater Topeka Chamber of Commerce called the company to find out what was going on, its calls were not returned.

In May, Payless announced it was moving its headquarters to — you guessed it — Bryan Tower in Dallas. Why? In a news release, the company said that “the Dallas location will further enhance and support the company’s global brand,” whatever that means. Perhaps more pertinent is the fact that among the consortium of Wall Street firms that took Payless private in 2012 was none other than Alden Global. In other words, it appears that Payless abandoned Topeka to help bail out one of Randall Smith’s real estate investments. Since that announcement in May, by the way, there have been additional layoffs.

As for the “potential tenant” Spire was in talks with, about a week ago, Meagan Nichols, an editor with the Memphis Business Journal, noticed that Fred’s Inc., a regional pharmacy chain based in the city, was posting executive job openings in Dallas. Fred’s, she pointed out to her readers, not only doesn’t have an office in Dallas; it doesn’t even have any stores there. You have to drive an hour and a half, to Tyler, to find the nearest Fred’s.

As it happens, Fred’s is Alden Global’s biggest single investment; after a flurry of recent purchases, it owns a third of the company. After some activist-style agitation, Freeman was installed as chairman in September 2017. Within seven months, he had fired the chief executive and installed, as “interim” CEO, Joe Anto. Anto came from Digital First Media, the company that runs Alden Global’s newspapers. A third board member, Sam Rossi, is the current chief executive of Digital First Media.

They are definitely not retail whizzes: For most of the time Alden Global has owned Fred’s stock, it has been a disastrous investment. At $20 a share in December 2016, it fell to $1.38 by last June. (It has since rallied a bit, to above $3.) According to the journalist Julie Reynolds, who covers Alden Global closely, several class action law firms are sniffing around, hoping to file a securities fraud suit.

In May, Fred’s added two new board members. Both of them are real estate experts. In a recent conference call, Anto said the company was planning to sell “portions of our vast real estate portfolio.” The company has already unloaded its small specialty pharmacy operation, which was a free service designed to help elderly customers. Anto has also said Fred’s is considering selling off some of its retail branches “in an effort to improve earnings and cash flow,” according to Forbes.

Seeing all this, Reynolds drew the obvious conclusion: “If this is starting to look like the chop-shop strategy Alden unleashed on DFM’s papers, it should.” Sure enough, in late October, Fred’s announced that it was laying off 80 employees — bringing its Memphis head count from 440 at the start of 2017 to 153.

And then there’s the likely shift to Dallas, which, like the Payless move, will help shore up Smith’s skyscraper while abandoning a city where the company has been based since the 1950s. A few days ago, a spokeswoman for Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland told the Memphis Business Journal that the mayor “certainly doesn’t want Fred’s to move out of Memphis. The mayor’s had several conversations with Fred’s representatives,” she added. “It’s a work in progress.”

All I can say is, don’t hold your breath, Mr. Mayor. As he has proved time and again, Heath Freeman couldn’t care less about the communities where his companies do business. That’s become his trademark. Your time will be better spent looking for a new tenant for Fred’s soon-to-be empty headquarters."

The rapidly expanding world of esports has a new publicly traded company, one that’s hoping to learn from the business model of another online gaming predecessor: poker.

Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. has agreed to purchase Allied Esports International Inc., an esports entertainment company, and WPT Enterprises, the creator of the World Poker Tour, from Ourgame International Holdings Ltd. for about $150 million. The new company, called Allied Esports Entertainment Inc., will have an initial enterprise value of about $214 million and trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol AESE.

The aim is to bring the World Poker Tour’s business model for live events and media distribution to the burgeoning world of competitive video gaming, which is projected to grow to a $1.7 billion industry by 2021. The new company plans to operate venues, sell the content generated by those events, and then move viewers onto a new online tournament platform to be launched in 2020.

“There’s a gap in monetization in esports right now,” Black Ridge Chairman Ken DeCubellis, who will be chief financial officer of the new company. “It’s a big buzzword, but the main way companies and investors are approaching esports is by investing in the game publishers or acquiring the teams that compete. We see an opportunity to monetize the viewership right now.”

There are 40 million people playing online poker globally, according to DeCubellis. By contrast, there are 2.2 billion video gamers, with 380 million viewers of global esports contests.

“Esports is such a bigger market,” DeCubellis said. “And the growth rates are so much higher.”

Black Ridge is a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, an entity with no assets that raises money to fund a future purchase. Sponsored by Black Ridge Oil & Gas Inc., it completed its initial public offering in October 2017, raising $138 million in cash proceeds.

Under the terms of the deal Black Ridge is issuing $118 million worth of shares to Ourgame, plus about $35 million.

The transaction is expected to close in the first few months of 2019. At that point Black Ridge will be renamed Allied Esports Entertainment and its ticker symbol will change.

The entire Black Ridge team will move to the new company. It’s a group with gaming experience, including Lyle Berman, who is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame, and a longtime poker executive. Frank Ng, chief executive officer of Ourgame, is also stepping down to take the same role in the new company.

“This will be a very powerful ecosystem,” Ng said.

The network of Allied Esports venues includes facilities in Las Vegas and Hamburg, as well as Beijing and Shenzen in China. The company operates a pair of traveling venues built on 18-wheeler trucks and has launched a program to help partner with groups looking to build their own stadiums around the world.

The World Poker Tour has used Allied’s Las Vegas venue in the past, and will continue to do so. The merger into an esports company won’t affect the brand’s poker operations, Ng said, but the group’s network will be used to help model the new tournament and streaming platform.

The new group plans to invest $100 million in the next three years to expand the venues, adding six more trucks and almost quadruple its number of affiliates to 26.

James Hackett is taking back the reins at Alta Mesa Resources Inc., the Oklahoma-focused shale producer that’s seen its market value drop from nearly $4 billion to less than $500 million. The shares soared as much as 29 percent in response.

The former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. chief executive has spent the past year as Alta Mesa’s chairman. Now, Hackett will take over the company’s helm, replacing Harlan Chappelle as CEO on an interim basis. Hackett, 64, said a series of “disappointments” left him feeling as if he had let investors down.

“I feel very spiritually inclined to do well,” Hackett, who left his post at Anadarko to attend Harvard Divinity School, said in an interview. “And that’s something we haven’t done at this company.”

Hackett attributes part of the company’s struggle over the past year to sector-wide challenges. The S&P 500 Energy Index has sunk 42 percent since peaking in mid-2014, while the broader S&P 500 index has gained 26 percent over the same period. But he also cites Alta Mesa’s inability to operate efficiently and a steep learning curve when it came to drilling in Oklahoma.

In August 2017, Hackett acquired Alta Mesa Holdings LP, a closely held independent producer in Oklahoma’s Stack play, and Kingfisher Midstream LLC, a pipeline company, via a blank-check company he formed with backing from private-equity firm Riverstone Holdings. At the time, the company was valued at about $3.8 billion.

In addition to Hackett, a group of three industry veterans from private equity advisory firm Meridian Energy LLC are joining Alta Mesa. Randy Limbacher, former CEO of closely held Samson Resources Co., has become president, with Mark Castiglione, previously a senior vice president at Quantum Resources LLC, as his chief of staff. John Campbell, who served as the chief operating officer at Quantum, is the new COO of upstream at Alta Mesa.

The management change will help turn things around for the company, said Derrick Whitfield, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in a telephone interview. The new leadership effectively wipes out concerns that the company will one day be forced to declare bankruptcy, he said.

“The debt guys were starting to circle around” Alta Mesa, Whitfield said. But with Hackett and his new team, “this is not a going concern now.”

“There’s absolutely no way they’d be tying themselves to a bankruptcy,” Whitfield said.

Oklahoma Optimism

Hackett said the company understands how to better space wells, among other operational challenges that had irritated analysts and investors who were promised a quick ramp-up in output. “We’re still very optimistic about what this part of the Stack can yield,” he said.

And while the lowest oil prices in more than a year will certainly provide a new hurdle as Hackett takes back control, he said he’s ready.

“I’m happy to do it again,” said Hackett, who will continue taking the Vonlane luxury bus to Austin once a week to teach a class at the University of Texas on moral leadership in economics. “I think the team that resigned felt they had enough time.”

Shockwaves in the c-suites of shale companies are showing investor frustration with an industry that continues to outspend cash flow.

Independent drillers such as Alta Mesa Resources Inc. and Centennial Resource Development Inc., whose leaders were once rewarded for amassing vast portfolios of drilling rights, are now being punished for failing to convert those holdings into profits. Even bigger players, like Pioneer Natural Resources Co. are feeling the heat.

Crude prices have never fully recovered from the 2014-2016 slump and investors have soured on the sector, undermining explorers dependent on regular cash infusions to finance drilling. In the past week alone, two prominent shale bosses departed their companies and a third saw his creation lose about 75 percent of its value. Meanwhile activist investors are beating the doors of at least 10 American drillers, urging management teams and directors to retire or sell out.

“Although the whole shale revolution appears to be quite powerful, if you look just under the hood, you see that every company has to run faster and faster to achieve growth,” shale pioneer and Centennial Chief Executive Officer Mark Papa said on a conference call Tuesday after releasing disappointing production numbers.

Activist Pressure

Centennial, which focuses on the Permian Basin that straddles West Texas and New Mexico, was created on the back of investors’ trust in Papa, 72, who built EOG Resources Inc. into what’s now the world’s second-largest independent oil producer by market value. Centennial tumbled Tuesday -- the shares are now down about 27 percent for the week -- after cutting the number of rigs it plans to deploy this year and pushing back the date for when it plans to stop outspending its cash flow.

Other high-profile figures in shale have fared even worse. On Feb. 21, Floyd Wilson, a wildcatter famed for the $10.5 billion sale of Petrohawk Energy Corp. to BHP Group, was ousted as CEO of Halcon Resources Corp. as activist investor pressure mounted after the company struggled to find enough cash to drill its leases. On the same day, Pioneer said it was bringing back founder Scott Sheffield to replace Tim Dove as CEO.

And on Monday, Alta Mesa Resources Inc., run by former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. CEO Jim Hackett, said it will take a writedown of about $3.1 billion because of a ""material weakness"" in its financial reporting. That sent its shares plunging as much as 69 percent and left its bonds trading at distressed levels.

""Expectations are high for operational execution and, as we’ve seen recently, the margin for error is often razor thin with little forgiveness from an investor base that is wondering if the underlying value proposition of the industry has more material issues,"" Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts said Wednesday in a note.

Parent-Child

Perhaps the biggest challenge for these companies is how close to one another oil wells can be drilled. If spaced too tightly, newer wells -- “child wells” -- can be less prolific than the “parent.” But too far apart and drillers risk leaving oil in the ground. It’s a serious problem that affects companies’ capital efficiency, said Brandon Myers, a Houston-based analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

“The issue for the entire Permian Basin relates to parent-child wells,” Papa said on the call. “Companies are going to have to pedal harder every year to get the kind of growth that perhaps they’ve been promising.""

“You’re getting data points every quarter from companies where they talk about, ‘Gee whiz, I thought I could drill 1,000 wells on my acreage and it turns out I can only drill 600 wells on my acreage’ because of, essentially, parent-child issues,"" he added.

Bigger companies are less at risk because they have more land to drill. But smaller publicly traded players and those backed by private equity typically drill more marginal locations in an effort to prove they have oil, with a view to selling the lease later on. With investors demanding immediate returns, some operators have had to switch to production mode, pitching them into direct competition with larger rivals for capital and services such as drilling and pumping.

For Alta Mesa, optimistic production targets proved unattainable. Created by Hackett in a three-way merger completed last year, the company’s operations are located in a lesser-known section of the Stack oil basin in Oklahoma. While that initially offered the promise of cheaper acreage, the company repeatedly missed production forecasts. Hackett took back the reins in December after its market value dropped from $3.8 billion to less than $500 million.

""The rocks are the rocks, and it doesn’t matter whose name is on it,"" said Subash Chandra, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC. ""If the assets are mediocre, $50 oil is a major problem.""

In the northeast, gas driller EQT Corp.’s challenges with well spacing are partially behind a battle with the founders of a company it acquired in 2017. With the backing of major investors including D.E. Shaw & Co., brothers Toby and Derek Rice have been urging directors to depose the current CEO and install Toby Rice in his place, among other operational changes. Laredo Petroleum Inc. and Matador Resources Co. have also faced questions about how they space wells.

“We’re at a point now where operators are really resetting expectations, and they’re taking corrective measures,” said Shak Ahmed, a research analyst at RS Energy Group. “We expect that to actually improve results going forward, but it’s obviously a pretty painful process getting to that point.”

Three years on from a slump in the oil market, prices are back up again and the U.S. has become the world’s largest producer. Yet the pain continues for some companies.

The boom in American shale output risks masking ongoing woes at a number of lower-tier explorers, as well as some oilfield servicers. Energy-related bankruptcies this year are trailing only those in the discretionary consumer goods sector, according to Bloomberg data. And some companies are warning of more stress ahead.

Weatherford International Plc, once one of the top providers of oil-well drilling and completion, last week said it was preparing to file for bankruptcy. Shale explorers Halcon Resources Corp. and Alta Mesa Resources Inc. have raised doubts about their ability to stay afloat. Bonds of producer California Resources Corp. are trading at yields of more than 10 percentage points above benchmark U.S. Treasuries, meeting a common definition of distressed debt.

These ailing companies reveal the flip side of the boom. High-cost producers with poor balance sheets are not getting much love from investors who are more focused on demanding returns than pouring more money into shale’s expansion, whether through debt or equity. And as producers rein in spending, the less-efficient service providers are struggling.

""There hasn’t been the institutional stomach, either at the debt level or the equity level, to go through the open-heart surgery that involves a bankruptcy,"" Patrick Hughes, a partner at law firm Haynes and Boone LLP, said in a phone interview. ""It takes a long time for the boards of these companies to really realize this may be the only way they can clean up the balance sheet.""

Weatherford said in a response to questions on Tuesday that it’s undergoing a “balance sheet” restructuring to address the company’s debt burden, and that this is “not a restructuring of operations, nor is it a declaration of bankruptcy.”

Halcon and California Resources didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. Alta Mesa declined to comment.

Bankruptcies Poised to Rebound This Year? Oil and gas bankruptcy debt hit 4-year low in 2018 Source: Haynes and Boone LLP

Crude’s 40% rebound since late December -- to about $60 a barrel in the U.S. and $70 elsewhere in the world -- wasn’t enough to prevent debt-burdened Bristow Group Inc. and PHI Inc., providers of helicopter services to offshore explorers, as well as producers Jones Energy Inc. and Rex Energy Corp., from filing for bankruptcy this year.

And making it tougher for the service providers are exploration customers who continue to hold the line on spending, with U.S. outlays expected to be down about 10 percent from last year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

""A lot of people see the $60 or $70 and assume everything is great,"" Spencer Cutter, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a phone interview. ""I think 2019 is going to be a bigger year for bankruptcies than 2018.""

The casualties from the downturn peaked in 2016, when 142 companies filed with $70.3 billion in debt, according to Haynes and Boone. That number shrunk by more than half to 41 companies filing with $17.2 billion in debt in 2018.

This year, a Weatherford bankruptcy alone would add about $8 billion of debt to the tally. It would be the biggest wreckage in the industry in four years. In the case of Halcon, going under would be a repeat of a previous bankruptcy. Halcon’s 6.75% bonds maturing in 2025 are trading at less than half their face value and are rated CC by S&P Global Ratings, a level that signals the company will likely fail to meet some of its obligations.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Weatherford signed a restructuring agreement with holders of about 62% of its senior unsecured notes to facilitate a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing. The agreement calls for holders of $7.4 billion in senior unsecured debt to receive 99% of the common equity of the restructured company as well as up to $1.25 billion in new unsecured notes. With over $2.3 billion in holdings, Franklin Resources was by far the largest holder of the company’s unsecured debt at the end of March, according to Bloomberg data.

Meanwhile, equity issuance for U.S. energy companies in the first quarter fell to the lowest level this decade and bond sales dropped more than a third from a year earlier, according to industry consultant Drilling Info.

""Sixty-dollar oil is good if you’re a low-cost producer without a ton of debt in the Permian or maybe the Bakken or one of the better basins,"" BI’s Cutter said. ""It’s ok if you’re a mid-tier, and it’s not so good if you’re third tier.""

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. has agreed to buy U.S. supercomputer maker Cray Inc. in a deal valued at about $1.4 billion as the firm works to become more competitive in high-end computing.

Cray investors will get $35 a share in cash, the companies said in a statement on Friday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg report. That represents a premium of about 17% above Thursday’s closing price. The deal values Cray at $1.3 billion net of cash, the firms said in the statement.

Cray jumped 17% to $34.89 at 9:49 a.m. in New York trading after earlier touching $34.96, the biggest intraday gain in a year. Palo Alto-based HP Enterprise gained about 2% to $14.82.

The deal will help HP Enterprise strengthen its position against International Business Machines Corp. It could also become HP Enterprise’s biggest since it started trading in 2015, surpassing its acquisition of Nimble Storage Inc. for about $1 billion more than two years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

HP Enterprise has mostly been paring down since it was created from the breakup of Hewlett-Packard Co. In 2017, it completed a spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corp. It’s also separated some software assets in an $8.8 billion deal with U.K.-based Micro Focus International Plc.

Still, the company has also committed $4 billion through 2022 to initiatives to develop artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and distributed computing offerings. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri, who succeeded Meg Whitman last year, said in November that HP Enterprise would start to see a return on that investment over the next two years.

Loss-making Cray traces its roots back to a company founded in 1972 by Seymour Cray, known as the “father of supercomputing.” This month, it signed a deal with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build a new $600 million system for research on artificial intelligence, weather, subatomic structures, genomics and physics.

HP Enterprise’s own high-end computer systems are used by the University of Notre Dame, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and chemical giant BASF SE, according to its website. Last year, it won a $57 million contract to provide supercomputers to the U.S. Department of Defense for helicopter design and weather forecasting.

Since 2015, when HP split into HPE (networking and consulting) and HP Inc. (PCs and printers), Neri has helped define the enterprise business’s scope, leading key acquisitions and the development of advanced servers while shuttering underperforming product lines.

What challenges do you see at this company as you look at how things are rapidly changing and moving to the cloud?

The cloud has to move closer and closer to where the data is being generated. It’s cheaper to move the cloud to where the data is, not the data where the cloud is, so we promised last year, at HPE Discover in Las Vegas, to invest $4 billion to develop that set of road maps and technologies.

How much pressure are you feeling from Google, Amazon.com, Microsoft, these big companies that have really put their stake in the cloud?

There’s no doubt that many of the workloads have moved to the public cloud. But big customers realize it’s cheaper for them to run things on their premises in their data center or in a sort of hybrid model. We believe that’s going to be the world as we go along, and there is a ton of opportunity to modernize that infrastructure and help customers decide what is the right mix.

Do you feel pressure, though, from some of the other competitors out there?

Well, listen, we’re competing with everybody, you know? We compete on one spectrum with the public cloud vendors, on the other spectrum with the equipment vendors. But we have a clear understanding and strategy. And if you look at our latest results, we’re making significant progress.

You guys have manufacturing in Mexico. You’re in 172 countries. How do you view the trade wars under way, and how might they affect you?

The situation we’re in creates uncertainty, and when there is uncertainty, customers tend to step back a little bit. Obviously, there needs to be a fair approach to trade, but we live in a global economy, and the supply chains we’ve put in place over the last few decades are complicated.

You’ve acquired a lot of companies, including a recent $1.4 billion deal for Cray Inc. Is there another piece you need to add on?

More and more intelligence comes through the security analytics that make infrastructure more autonomous. Valuations tend to be a little bit erratic of late, but if it makes sense, we’ll consider it.

There’s a lot of money out there in the world, especially in the private equity market. Anybody knocking on your door to maybe buy you?

No, not at all. We’re focused on executing our strategy and making this company relevant for the future, to become a trusted adviser to our customers. And I have to say, we’re having a ton of fun.

You’ve been at HPE for a quarter of a century. What’s the best advice you got from a mentor?

First, you have to have a clear vision for yourself, where you want to be, and establish clear milestones. Second, you have to deliver what you say. Build a network of people who will take an interest in you. And then, taking risk is important. Sometimes you have to move sideways to move upward.

The Trump administration’s latest assault on China is aimed at forestalling advances in super-computing: a sector with profound military and technology implications -- and one where the world’s No. 2 economy poses a credible threat to U.S. dominance.

Washington’s campaign to contain the ascendancy of a potential global rival has expanded beyond telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. to a quintet of Chinese enterprises that embody a nation’s effort to build ever-faster computers. Those ultra-powerful machines, which process calculations on an unimaginable scale, support critical fields from massive data-crunching to artificial intelligence.

On Friday, five Chinese entities joined Huawei on a blacklist that bars them from buying American technology, just days ahead of an important summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Washington raised national security concerns because their computers were developed for military uses or in cooperation with the Chinese military. At the same time, U.S. pressure could have the effect of crimping China’s high-performance computing effort, which has produced some of the world’s fastest machines.

“China’s HPC business development will slow down for sure for both technology and business. However, there are other vendors that will narrow the gap as long as they are not put onto the list,” said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst with Forrester Research.

Among the five was government-backed Sugon, which claims to be the country’s leader in supercomputer sales. It’s one of a coterie of increasingly aggressive supercomputer projects backed by Beijing that are winning credibility in a field pioneered by American names that have fallen on hard times. The storied but money-losing Cray Inc., for example, agreed this year to be acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.

“There’s a broader concern about what China is going to do with supercomputers, particularly when it comes to military applications,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at the Eurasia Group.

Another addition to Washington’s blacklist is Higon, which Commerce identified as a Sugon subsidiary and partners with the U.S. chip maker Advanced Micro Device Inc. in a Chinese joint venture. AMD uses that venture -- Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. -- to license microprocessor technology to clients such as Higon in the world’s biggest PC market. Lisa Su, AMD’s chief executive officer, told a recent conference in Taiwan that AMD would not license newer technologies to Chinese clients. The company said Friday it will comply with the order.

Higon in turn part-owns another two on Trump’s list: Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology. The fifth entity is the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, which Commerce said was owned by the People’s Liberation Army’s 56th Research Institute. That agency’s mission was “to support China’s military modernization,” according to Commerce.

Sugon itself is open about working with the Chinese government and hopes to “build a cloud data service network covering hundreds of cities and sectors to provide a wealth of intelligent applications and services for the government, industry and the general population,” according to its website. The U.S. however accused the company on Friday of being “involved in activities determined to be contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.”

“Sugon is pretty small, but it’s symbolic,” said Triolo. “You can argue there’s a clearer national security case with Sugon than with Huawei.”

Taking Sugon out of the equation will hamper but not kill Beijing’s supercomputing endeavors. While the company and its units claim to be the volume leader, there are other outfits considered more advanced technically. They include Inspur Ltd., a computer and cloud services provider with government ties, and a plethora of projects backed by prestigious institutions. Those include an advanced earth ecosystem simulator inside Tsinghua University capable of processing 100 tera-floating-point operations a second.

If “chipset makers in the U.S. stop the supply of product that Sugon has been largely relying on for its high performance computing business, the impact on Sugon’s HPC business will be fatal,” Dai said.

When last we left Alden Global Capital LLC and its 39-year-old managing partner, Heath Freeman, they had just purchased the Boston Herald, the struggling tabloid that competes with the Boston Globe. The $12 million purchase took place in March; within a week, to the surprise of absolutely no one, Alden Global announced that it would lay off a quarter of the staff.

This, of course, is Alden Global’s MO. It buys up newspapers — more than 90 so far — but unlike Jeff Bezos at the Washington Post, the firm isn’t doing it to revive them. Instead, it cuts and cuts, and then cuts some more, until there’s little left but a carcass. Speaking truth to power, the importance of the Fourth Estate to a functioning democracy, the idea of bearing witness — none of that matters to Freeman and his fellow hedgies at Alden Global. Their only goal is to suck out cash and redirect it elsewhere. At the Herald alone, those first layoffs were followed by more, until its staff has shrunk from 240 employees to about 100. No one thinks it’s done shrinking.

If Freeman spoke to the press — he never has, so far as I can tell — he would likely justify his strategy by saying that he was deploying the cash he generates from his newspaper pillaging for investments that can earn higher returns. Just one problem: Alden Global’s non-newspaper investments have done horribly. To judge from recent events, the hedge fund’s treatment of some of these holdings is as heartless as its treatment of its newspapers. We’re going to focus our attention today on those non-newspaper investments.

Alden Global was founded by a Wall Street billionaire named Randall Smith, whom the New York Post once labeled “the grandfather of vulture investing.” In 2007, Smith hired Freeman away from a more genteel firm, mentored him in the ruthless ways of vulture investing, and then handed Alden Global over to him.

Smith also owned a real estate development company, Spire Realty, that operated primarily in Texas. Among its holdings is Bryan Tower, a Dallas skyscraper that was built in the early 1970s by the great Texas developer Trammel Crow. Smith and his son Caleb, who is a partner at Spire Realty, renovated the tower shortly after buying it in 1998.

It’s now 20 years since the renovation, and the building is getting a little long in the tooth. Inevitably, tenants are starting to look for shinier quarters. Thus it was that last month, Baylor Scott & White Health Obligated Group, the largest health-care system in Texas — and the building’s biggest tenant — announced that it would be moving out in 2020 for a new headquarters building going up in one of the city’s hipper neighborhoods.

Within days, Morningstar Credit Rating put Bryan Tower on its “watch list,” citing the possibility that a $61.9 million loan might default. “Without Baylor’s rent, the property’s cash flow would decrease below breakeven and raise the risk of term default,” Morningstar warned.

Joe Ruff, Spire’s president, quickly responded that there was nothing to worry about. “We have no intentions of defaulting on the note,” he said, pointing out that that company was already in “talks” with a potential tenant “of similar size.”

In fact, Bryan Tower had already landed a tenant a few months earlier: privately held Payless ShoeSource Inc. The company, long based in Topeka, Kansas, went through bankruptcy in 2017. Upon emerging, it set about outsourcing its information technology department, laying off 235 employees, and putting its headquarters up for sale. When the Greater Topeka Chamber of Commerce called the company to find out what was going on, its calls were not returned.

In May, Payless announced it was moving its headquarters to — you guessed it — Bryan Tower in Dallas. Why? In a news release, the company said that “the Dallas location will further enhance and support the company’s global brand,” whatever that means. Perhaps more pertinent is the fact that among the consortium of Wall Street firms that took Payless private in 2012 was none other than Alden Global. In other words, it appears that Payless abandoned Topeka to help bail out one of Randall Smith’s real estate investments. Since that announcement in May, by the way, there have been additional layoffs.

As for the “potential tenant” Spire was in talks with, about a week ago, Meagan Nichols, an editor with the Memphis Business Journal, noticed that Fred’s Inc., a regional pharmacy chain based in the city, was posting executive job openings in Dallas. Fred’s, she pointed out to her readers, not only doesn’t have an office in Dallas; it doesn’t even have any stores there. You have to drive an hour and a half, to Tyler, to find the nearest Fred’s.

As it happens, Fred’s is Alden Global’s biggest single investment; after a flurry of recent purchases, it owns a third of the company. After some activist-style agitation, Freeman was installed as chairman in September 2017. Within seven months, he had fired the chief executive and installed, as “interim” CEO, Joe Anto. Anto came from Digital First Media, the company that runs Alden Global’s newspapers. A third board member, Sam Rossi, is the current chief executive of Digital First Media.

They are definitely not retail whizzes: For most of the time Alden Global has owned Fred’s stock, it has been a disastrous investment. At $20 a share in December 2016, it fell to $1.38 by last June. (It has since rallied a bit, to above $3.) According to the journalist Julie Reynolds, who covers Alden Global closely, several class action law firms are sniffing around, hoping to file a securities fraud suit.

In May, Fred’s added two new board members. Both of them are real estate experts. In a recent conference call, Anto said the company was planning to sell “portions of our vast real estate portfolio.” The company has already unloaded its small specialty pharmacy operation, which was a free service designed to help elderly customers. Anto has also said Fred’s is considering selling off some of its retail branches “in an effort to improve earnings and cash flow,” according to Forbes.

Seeing all this, Reynolds drew the obvious conclusion: “If this is starting to look like the chop-shop strategy Alden unleashed on DFM’s papers, it should.” Sure enough, in late October, Fred’s announced that it was laying off 80 employees — bringing its Memphis head count from 440 at the start of 2017 to 153.

And then there’s the likely shift to Dallas, which, like the Payless move, will help shore up Smith’s skyscraper while abandoning a city where the company has been based since the 1950s. A few days ago, a spokeswoman for Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland told the Memphis Business Journal that the mayor “certainly doesn’t want Fred’s to move out of Memphis. The mayor’s had several conversations with Fred’s representatives,” she added. “It’s a work in progress.”

All I can say is, don’t hold your breath, Mr. Mayor. As he has proved time and again, Heath Freeman couldn’t care less about the communities where his companies do business. That’s become his trademark. Your time will be better spent looking for a new tenant for Fred’s soon-to-be empty headquarters."
