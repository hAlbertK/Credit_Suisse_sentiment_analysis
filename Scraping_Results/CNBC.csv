Here are the key numbers:

Earnings: 45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Revenue: $7.22 billion, vs. $7.26 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

HPE's revenue declined 7% on an annualized basis in the fiscal third quarter, which ended July 31, according to a statement. The company's revenue has now declined year over year for three consecutive quarters.

With respect to guidance, HPE raised full-year guidance to $1.72 to $1.76 in earnings per share, excluding certain items. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting $1.68 in earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the full fiscal year.

The majority of HPE's revenue comes from its Hybrid IT business segment, which includes servers, storage and networking equipment for data centers. The segment produced $5.55 billion in quarterly revenue in the fiscal third quarter, down 9% on an annualized basis and below the $5.70 billion consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. Compute revenue, which represents more than half of Hybrid IT revenue and includes sales of servers, fell 10% on an annualized basis in the quarter.

""While elongated sales cycles persist and remain more pronounced for large enterprise deals there are not materially worse than in June,"" Tarek Robbiati, HPE's chief financial officer, told analysts on a Tuesday conference call. ""HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets. We have also been able to successfully navigate all of the recent tariff increases on China exports that have been factored into our outlook.""

HPE executives disclosed sales execution issues one quarter earlier, with CEO Antonio Neri saying the company had taken steps to improve.

""Fiscal year 2019 was not a year where we wanted to dial up the growth,"" Robbiati said on Tuesday's conference call. ""Fiscal year 2019 is a year where we had to deliver on EPS commitment drive free cash flow. These are the two most important metrics prepare ourselves to dial up the growth in the subsequent quarters.""

In the fiscal third quarter, HPE made a one-time arbitration award to DXC, a company that was formed as HPE's Enterprise Services Business spun out and merged with CSC in 2017. Also in the quarter HPE announced its intent to buy supercomputing company Cray in a deal valued at around $1.3 billion. HPE now expects the deal to close by the end of the 2019 fiscal year, which is earlier than expected.

Shares of HPE are down 2% from the beginning of 2019.

Deere — The heavy equipment maker reported quarterly profit of $3.52 per share, 10 cents a share below estimates. Revenue exceeded analysts' expectations. Deere cut its full-year forecast, saying ""persistent uncertainty"" in its agricultural markets is weighing on its outlook, but that its long-term fundamentals and overall economic conditions remain positive.

Pinterest — Pinterest lost $41.4 million during the first quarter in its first quarterly report since going public in April. Pinterest reported $201.9 million in revenue, but noted that expenses grew by almost a third compared to a year earlier due mostly to the cost of adding new employees. Pinterest reported a higher-than-expected number of monthly active users.

Applied Materials — Applied Materials reported adjusted quarterly profit of 70 cents per share, beating consensus estimates by 4 cents a share. The semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker also reported better-than-expected revenue, and its guidance for the current quarter is largely above analysts' forecasts. The results are alleviating some concerns about a slowing semiconductor market.

Luckin Coffee — Luckin priced its initial public offering at $17 per share, at the high end of the projected range. Luckin is the second largest coffee train in China, trailing only Starbucks.

Nvidia — Nvidia beat estimates by 7 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 88 cents per share, The graphics chipmaker also reported slightly better-than-expected revenue. Nvidia's results were helped by growing demand for its gaming chips.

Baidu — Baidu missed estimates on both the top and bottom lines in its latest earnings report. The China-based search engine company also gave a quarterly revenue outlook that falls below analysts' expectations.

Amazon.com — Amazon has taken a stake in British online food delivery company Deliveroo, a competitor to Uber's Uber Eats and other delivery services. Deliveroo said Amazon was the lead investor in a new funding round that raised $575 million.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise — HPE announced a deal to buy supercomputer maker Cray for $35 per share or $1.3 billion in cash. It expects the deal to be accretive to profit in the first full year after the deal closes

Tesla — Tesla CEO Elon Musk has told employees he will scrutinize expenses even more closely, as the electric car maker tries to cut costs further. Separately, the automaker's Autopilot system was engaged during a fatal March 1 crash of a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida, in at least the third fatal U.S. crash reported involving the driver-assistance system, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday.

Richards | AFP | Getty Images

Despite the year being more than halfway over, the pace of store closures doesn't appear to be slowing down in the retail industry. More companies piled on the bad news this week. So far, 7,062 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers this year, according to a tracking done by Coresight Research. And the tally could top 12,000 by the end of 2019, setting a new record, Coresight says. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time high of 8,139 closures announced in 2017. With the back-to-school shopping season and winter holidays looming, most retailers planning to shut stores this year have already shuffled through those announcements so they can shift their focus toward the industry's busiest times. But analysts say there are still some exhausted businesses teetering on the brink of survival, as sales continue to shift to the internet and younger brands like Warby Parker, Casper and Allbirds steal shoppers' attention. Take Mattress Firm as one example. The company emerged from bankruptcy back in October. But it's still suffering in an increasingly competitive landscape with newer entrants like Casper and Eight Sleep. And it hasn't been able to achieve all the concessions from landlords that it desired. All the store closure announcements have also been bad news for U.S. mall owners like Simon and Macerich, which were already struggling with traffic to department stores falling off. The landlords are getting creative with their malls, now, bringing in more food options, e-commerce brands and even apartments, hotels and office spaces. The mall model is being reinvented. Amid all the closings, there are still retailers opening stores. Coresight has tracked 3,017 store opening announcements so far this year. This past Thursday, Lululemon opened its biggest store ever in Chicago. And there's a massive, 3-million-square-foot mall called American Dream slated to open in New Jersey on Oct. 25. Below is a running list of some of the most significant retail store closure announcements so far this year.

Fred's

Fred's said Friday it will shutter another 129 stores this year, as the company works to repay its debt and diversify its product selection. It was already planning to close 263 shops in 2019. Now, the discount retailer says it will have roughly 80 retail stores and 166 pharmacies still operating following all the closures. Fred's, which sells groceries and other everyday items like cleaning supplies, has been a victim of e-commerce's ascent in many households. Its shares have tumbled more than 75% this year to trade below $1.

Charming Charlie

Accessories chain Charming Charlie filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week and said with that it plans to close all 261 stores by the end of August. This marks the second time the retailer has filed for bankruptcy in under two years. The company said it hasn't been able to come up with a plan to win shoppers back and ""ensure long-term profitability"" for the business.

Bed Bath & Beyond

Bed Bath & Beyond plans to close at least 40 locations this year — and likely more — while opening 15 stores. The company has said unless it's able to ""negotiate more favorable lease terms with ... landlords,"" the number of closures will grow. Bed Bath & Beyond, which also owns Christmas Tree Shops, lost its CEO Steven Temares in May, with its financial performance weakening and activist investors pushing for change. The company's stock is down about 1% for the year.

Dressbarn

Women's fashion retailer Dressbarn, owned by Ascena Retail Group, is going out of business for good this year. Ascena said it decided to wind down that business entirely in order to be able to turn its focus to its more profitable brands like Ann Taylor and Loft. Just last month, it released a list of the first 28 Dressbarn stores expected to close this year but hasn't announced anything beyond that. All told, about 650 stores across the country will go dark.

Topshop

Fast-fashion chain Topshop is shutting all 11 of its stores in the U.S. The retailer's London-based parent company, Arcadia Group, filed for bankruptcy protection in May, citing ""challenging retail headwinds, changing consumer habits and ever-increasing online competition."" Topshop's U.S. stores are in major markets like New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Miami. The company hasn't yet said when it expects the 11 stores to close.

Party City

Party City plans to shut about 45 stores in the U.S. this year. That's more than normal. The party-supply retailer had been closing 10 to 15 stores, on average, annually. Following the announcement, some speculated a global helium shortage was straining its business of selling balloons for birthday parties, weddings and other special occasions. But the retailer said it was able to secure a new source of helium and that the decision to close more stores in 2019 was unrelated to the global shortage. Party City shares are down more than 28% this year.

Pier 1 Imports

Pier 1 Imports is planning to shut 57 stores in 2019, and potentially more. The home goods retailer in June said if it's ""unable to achieve our performance goals, sales targets and reductions in occupancies and other costs,"" it could shutter as much as 15% of its fleet. Pier 1 closed 30 stores in 2018, leaving it with about 1,000 locations in total across the U.S. Many shoppers have navigated to Amazon and other online retailers to buy things like dishes, wall art and the small furniture accessories that Pier 1 sells. The retailer's shares are up a little more than 1% for the year.

CVS

CVS is closing 46 of its ""underperforming"" locations across the country this year. That's still less than 1% of CVS' roughly 9,600 stores nationwide. But the drugstore chain, like many retailers today, must work toward culling its massive footprint and adding unique services to stores to keep customers coming back. As it shuts some stores, CVS is adding hundreds of SmileDirectClub shops inside certain CVS locations, offering shoppers a cheaper way to straighten their teeth. It's also opening up locations known as HealthHUBS that boast services and products like blood testing and sleep apnea machines. CVS' stock is down nearly 12% in 2019.

Gap

Gap Inc. is planning to shut 230 of its namesake brand's stores over the next two years. This fiscal year, Gap said it expects to close about 50 company-owned stores, net of any new openings or repositionings. The apparel retailer in February announced its plans to split its business into two publicly traded companies, one that includes Gap, Banana Republic, Intermix and its women's and men's athleisure brands Athleta and Hill City, and another with just Old Navy. Gap Inc. shares have fallen more than 27% this year.

Victoria's Secret

L Brands' Victoria's Secret is planning to shut 53 stores this year, as the lingerie retailer struggles to appeal to women with its outdated and over-the-top bras and underwear. On average, the company has been closing roughly 15 stores each year. Meantime, online-based lingerie brands like Adore Me and Lively are opening up stores, potentially making it more difficult for Victoria's Secret to win back market share. L Brands' stock is up about 3% year to date.

Bath & Body Works

L Brands' Bath & Body Works also has some closures planned. The retailer said it intends to shut two dozen locations this year. But it will also be opening 46 stores and renovating more than 170 locations. As Victoria's Secret's sales have been in a slump, Bath & Body Works has been a bright spot for L Brands. The company reported in May that Bath & Body Work's same-store sales surged 13% during the fiscal first quarter. The upbeat news led L Brands to hike its profit outlook for the full year.

Abercrombie & Fitch

Specialty apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. said it plans to close up to 40 stores during fiscal 2019, after closing 29 locations last year. The company has, meanwhile, been working toward reducing the size of its stores and remodeling existing locations. Abercrombie also said it plans to open additional stores this year, to make up for the closures, after opening 22 stores in 2018. It also owns the Hollister clothing brand. The retailer's stock has fallen roughly 10% in 2019.

Charlotte Russe

Teen apparel retailer Charlotte Russe is liquidating and closing all of its stores, after filing for bankruptcy protection in February. At the time, it was only planning to shut 94 stores. But now, the company will be closing more than 500 locations across the country, after a liquidator won the auction for its business in bankruptcy court. Many of its stores are found within shopping malls.

Payless ShoeSource

Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy in February and has started the process of shutting all 2,500 of its stores across North America. Payless struggled with a heavy debt load and also said in court documents it faced ""unanticipated"" delays from its suppliers in recent years that forced it to sell inventory at deep discounts. It's also fallen victim to more consumers shopping for footwear online.

Gymboree

When kids clothing company Gymboree filed for bankruptcy protection in January, it said it would close all 800 of its Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores. It's since sold the rights associated with both Gymboree and its Crazy 8 brand to Children's Place, while Gap has acquired Gymboree's Janie and Jack brand's intellectual property, its website, customer data and other assets.

Family Dollar

Discount chain Dollar Tree said it plans to close 390 Family Dollar stores this year while it renovates 1,000 other locations. After buying Family Dollar in 2015, Dollar Tree has been left with the task of improving the appearance of those stores, many of which are run down. It's also been trying to cut costs. Dollar Tree shares are up more than 24% year to date.

Chico's

Women's clothing retailer Chico's said it will shut between 60 to 80 stores in fiscal 2019. The company overall intends to close at least 250 stores in the U.S. over the next three years. It joins a list of apparel companies that are struggling to stay afloat, as more sales move online and shoppers are lured to fast-fashion brands like Zara. Chico's shares have tumbled more than 38% this year.

Drew Angerer | Getty Images

The store closures just keep coming, from Dressbarn, CVS, Party City, Pier 1 Imports and more. Already, more than 7,150 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers in 2019, according to Coresight Research. And it's not even June. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time record 8,139 closures announced in 2017. Meanwhile, Coresight has tracked 2,726 store opening announcements so far this year.

With the threat of additional tariffs taking effect on consumer-facing goods like apparel and footwear imported from China hanging over retailers, things could get even worse, according to one analyst. UBS' Jay Sole recently said in a note to clients: ""The market is not realizing how much brick & mortar retail is incrementally struggling and how new 25% tariffs could force widespread store closures. ... We think potential 25% tariffs on Chinese imports could accelerate pressure on these [companies'] profit margins to the point where major store closures become a real possibility."" The store closures already announced this year also mean more bad news for U.S. mall owners, which have already been struggling with traffic to department stores, their anchor tenants, largely on the demise. So these mall owners are having to get creative, bringing in more food options, and even apartments and office spaces, to their properties. Here are some of the biggest retailers that have announced store closures so far this year.

The discount retailer said at the time, ""most of these stores have near‐term lease expirations and limited remaining lease obligations."" Then, just earlier this month, it said it plans to shutter another 104 Fred's stores by the end of June, bringing the total closures to 263.

Qualcomm, Xilinx, Broadcom –Chipmakers were under pressure led by declines in Qualcomm and Xilinx, which tumbled 6% and 3.6%, respectively. Broadcom also dropped 6%. The drop came after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and effectively halted its ability to buy American-made parts and components. This led Google to suspended business activity with the Chinese telecom giant. Other Huawei suppliers, including Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel and Xilinx, will reportedly stop selling to the Huawei until further notice. U.S. chip suppliers are losing a big customer as Huawei purchases $20 billion of semiconductors each year.

Sprint, T-Mobile — Sprint shares surged 18.8% after the Federal Communications Commission's chairman said he would recommend the company's $26.5 billion merger with T-Mobile. T-Mobile shares also rose 3.9%.

Deutsche Bank — The German bank's U.S.-listed shares slid 2% after UBS downgraded it to sell from neutral. The UBS analyst said Deutsche is a ""levered market play vulnerable to external events and rising rates are currently a distant hope.""

Tesla — Tesla dropped 2.3% after a Wedbush analyst lowered its price target on the electric car maker's stock to $230 from $275. The analyst cited concerns that CEO Elon Musk's expansion into other products is distracting the company from what should be its main goal: gathering core demand for its Model 3.

Apple — Shares of Apple slid 3.1% after HSBC cut the tech company's price target to $174 per share from $180 due to concerns over the looming tariff concerns between the U.S. and China. HSBC believes tariff increases would force Apple to raise prices on its products, which are already seen as expensive. The bank also said there is a risk that Chinese consumers would shift to local brands with comparable products such as Huawei and Xiaomi.

Dish Network — Dish shares slid nearly 6% after announcing it will buy streaming company EchoStar's satellite business for $800 million. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019.

Tata Motors — Shares of Indian automaker Tata Motors climbed 5.7% following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings released before the bell Monday. Tata Motors earned $160.26 million in net profit for the quarter ended on March 31, topping a Refinitiv estimate. The company, however, said it struggled to sell its Jaguar Land Rover in key markets like China.

Delta Air Lines — Delta fell 1.1% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight. Morgan Stanley cited concerns that the airline's free cash flow yield is falling, and the investment bank's updated 2020 estimates which are below the consensus estimates.

Ryanair — Europe's low-cost airline Ryanair fell 2.1% after reporting its weakest annual profit in fours years on Monday. Ryanair cited issues with overcapacity, Brexit and problems with the grounded Boeing 737 MAX for its disappointing quarterly results.

Del Frisco's Restaurant — The steakhouse chain's stock skyrocketed 31.2% higher after The Deal reported that final bids for the company were around $9 per share. That number is 89.5% above Del Frisco's closing price on Friday of $4.75.

Looking for a new restaurant to try out before its lines get too long? Fishbowl Analytics has got you covered. The firm released its sixth annual list of emerging restaurant brands Tuesday. Past lists have tapped up-and-coming brands like Sweetgreen, which reached a valuation of $1 billion last year, and Shake Shack as chains to watch. The analytics firm rates brands using a combination of nominations, media mentions and social media buzz to curate its list, Fishbowl analyst Katharine Dalton said. To be considered, chains must have five to 75 locations. This year's list is one of its most diverse, representing a range of flavor profiles and restaurant concepts, Dalton said. But one characteristic that most of the chains have in common is their health-focused menus. According to Dalton, that's now the price of entry, not a distinguishing feature.

10. Punch Bowl Social

Millennials are all about experiences, according to marketing professionals. Punch Bowl Social aims to take advantage of that with a mix of dining and entertainment that echos Dave & Buster's. Customers can find corn hole, arcade games, pingpong tables and bowling lanes in its locations. The budding chain also offers a full food and drink menu when players need more sustenance. And if there isn't a location near you yet, there might be soon. The company has plans to add seven restaurants this year to its existing fleet of 16.

9. Bibibop Asian Grill

Bibibop Source: Bibibop

Bibibop Asian Grill lets you customize your entree from start to finish. The chain takes its inspiration from the Korean rice dish bibimbap. The Columbus, Ohio-based chain, which has 30 locations, is also focused on bringing food to its customers that leaves them feeling happy and healthy. Fishbowl pointed to menu items like bubble tea and cucumber wasabi as fan favorites. Founder Charley Shin is no newcomer to the industry. He's behind Charleys Philly Steaks, which has been around since 1986 and has more than 500 locations.

8. The Little Beet

While its name suggests a beet-focused menu, The Little Beet's menu includes a much wider variety of veggies. Its produce is locally sourced, with a number of vegan friendly choices. The Little Beet also says all of its menu items are both gluten-free and ""guiltin' free."" For now, the fast-casual chain has nine locations in New York and Washington, D.C., but is expanding to Florida in 2019.

7. Lemonade

Founded 11 years ago, Lemonade offers a variety of both lemonade flavors and entrees. Diners move through the restaurant selecting their salads, braised meat dishes and sandwiches cafeteria-style, complete with trays. The California fast-casual chain has 28 locations, but a recent merger with Modern Market Eatery will result in 58 stores in 10 markets between the two of them, with licensing and franchising plans ahead. Lemonade will continue to focus its growth on California, at least initially.

6. Urban Plates

This restaurant is already seeing its lines extend past its doors. Customers love their grass-fed steak and sustainable produce, according to Fishbowl. Like Lemonade, the food here is served cafeteria-style. Urban Plates has locations on both coasts, with 13 eateries in California and 3 in Washington, D.C. The company completed a $38 million fund round in late 2018.

5. Mendocino Farms

Mendocino Farms

The California-based sandwich shop is back on the list again this year thanks to its friendly service and varied line-up of salads and sandwiches. According to Dalton, Mendocino Farms is a ""massive fan favorite."" It's also starting to expand outside of its home market in Southern California to Northern California and Texas. The chain has 25 locations and five more are on the way. In 2015, Whole Foods — prior to its acquisition by Amazon — invested in the company.

4. Dig Inn

This fast-casual eatery takes pride in its locally sourced ingredients. Dig Inn also has it owns farm in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. To keep its prices low, the chain tries to minimize waste by using the entire vegetable. When mixed together, those ingredients result in dishes that diners love to recommend. It has taken the chain eight years to reach 26 locations, mostly in New York City and Boston, but it has much bigger expansion goals this year. It could open as many as 15 stores in 2019 alone.

3. True Food Kitchen

Last year's Number 1 emerging restaurant brand, True Food Kitchen is known for its health-focused menu with vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. It slipped two spots this year in a tight race, but reviewers still love its food, which ranges from quinoa burgers to edamame dumplings to chocolate cake. Oprah Winfrey joined the company's board in 2018 after making an undisclosed equity investment, which the chain plans to use to double its store count over the next two years, focusing mostly on the East Coast. True Food Kitchen has 23 locations. ""I think this could be the year that True Food really explodes,"" Dalton said.

2. Bartaco

Bartaco specializes in street food favorites found in Southern California, Mexico and South America. During its fiscal fourth quarter, the brand opened two more locations, bringing its total to 18. Customers ""highly recommend"" the restaurant and say that they definitely plan to return, Fishbowl found. Fishbowl isn't the only one that sees Bartaco's potential. Del Frisco's Restaurant Group last year acquired the chain's parent company, which also owns a more upscale brand called Barcelona, for $325 million in cash. The company said that it plans to add three to four locations in 2019.

Here are the key numbers:

Earnings: 45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

45 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 40 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Revenue: $7.22 billion, vs. $7.26 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

HPE's revenue declined 7% on an annualized basis in the fiscal third quarter, which ended July 31, according to a statement. The company's revenue has now declined year over year for three consecutive quarters.

With respect to guidance, HPE raised full-year guidance to $1.72 to $1.76 in earnings per share, excluding certain items. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting $1.68 in earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the full fiscal year.

The majority of HPE's revenue comes from its Hybrid IT business segment, which includes servers, storage and networking equipment for data centers. The segment produced $5.55 billion in quarterly revenue in the fiscal third quarter, down 9% on an annualized basis and below the $5.70 billion consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. Compute revenue, which represents more than half of Hybrid IT revenue and includes sales of servers, fell 10% on an annualized basis in the quarter.

""While elongated sales cycles persist and remain more pronounced for large enterprise deals there are not materially worse than in June,"" Tarek Robbiati, HPE's chief financial officer, told analysts on a Tuesday conference call. ""HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets. We have also been able to successfully navigate all of the recent tariff increases on China exports that have been factored into our outlook.""

HPE executives disclosed sales execution issues one quarter earlier, with CEO Antonio Neri saying the company had taken steps to improve.

""Fiscal year 2019 was not a year where we wanted to dial up the growth,"" Robbiati said on Tuesday's conference call. ""Fiscal year 2019 is a year where we had to deliver on EPS commitment drive free cash flow. These are the two most important metrics prepare ourselves to dial up the growth in the subsequent quarters.""

In the fiscal third quarter, HPE made a one-time arbitration award to DXC, a company that was formed as HPE's Enterprise Services Business spun out and merged with CSC in 2017. Also in the quarter HPE announced its intent to buy supercomputing company Cray in a deal valued at around $1.3 billion. HPE now expects the deal to close by the end of the 2019 fiscal year, which is earlier than expected.

Shares of HPE are down 2% from the beginning of 2019.

Richards | AFP | Getty Images

Despite the year being more than halfway over, the pace of store closures doesn't appear to be slowing down in the retail industry. More companies piled on the bad news this week. So far, 7,062 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers this year, according to a tracking done by Coresight Research. And the tally could top 12,000 by the end of 2019, setting a new record, Coresight says. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time high of 8,139 closures announced in 2017. With the back-to-school shopping season and winter holidays looming, most retailers planning to shut stores this year have already shuffled through those announcements so they can shift their focus toward the industry's busiest times. But analysts say there are still some exhausted businesses teetering on the brink of survival, as sales continue to shift to the internet and younger brands like Warby Parker, Casper and Allbirds steal shoppers' attention. Take Mattress Firm as one example. The company emerged from bankruptcy back in October. But it's still suffering in an increasingly competitive landscape with newer entrants like Casper and Eight Sleep. And it hasn't been able to achieve all the concessions from landlords that it desired. All the store closure announcements have also been bad news for U.S. mall owners like Simon and Macerich, which were already struggling with traffic to department stores falling off. The landlords are getting creative with their malls, now, bringing in more food options, e-commerce brands and even apartments, hotels and office spaces. The mall model is being reinvented. Amid all the closings, there are still retailers opening stores. Coresight has tracked 3,017 store opening announcements so far this year. This past Thursday, Lululemon opened its biggest store ever in Chicago. And there's a massive, 3-million-square-foot mall called American Dream slated to open in New Jersey on Oct. 25. Below is a running list of some of the most significant retail store closure announcements so far this year.

Fred's

Fred's said Friday it will shutter another 129 stores this year, as the company works to repay its debt and diversify its product selection. It was already planning to close 263 shops in 2019. Now, the discount retailer says it will have roughly 80 retail stores and 166 pharmacies still operating following all the closures. Fred's, which sells groceries and other everyday items like cleaning supplies, has been a victim of e-commerce's ascent in many households. Its shares have tumbled more than 75% this year to trade below $1.

Charming Charlie

Accessories chain Charming Charlie filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week and said with that it plans to close all 261 stores by the end of August. This marks the second time the retailer has filed for bankruptcy in under two years. The company said it hasn't been able to come up with a plan to win shoppers back and ""ensure long-term profitability"" for the business.

Bed Bath & Beyond

Bed Bath & Beyond plans to close at least 40 locations this year — and likely more — while opening 15 stores. The company has said unless it's able to ""negotiate more favorable lease terms with ... landlords,"" the number of closures will grow. Bed Bath & Beyond, which also owns Christmas Tree Shops, lost its CEO Steven Temares in May, with its financial performance weakening and activist investors pushing for change. The company's stock is down about 1% for the year.

Dressbarn

Women's fashion retailer Dressbarn, owned by Ascena Retail Group, is going out of business for good this year. Ascena said it decided to wind down that business entirely in order to be able to turn its focus to its more profitable brands like Ann Taylor and Loft. Just last month, it released a list of the first 28 Dressbarn stores expected to close this year but hasn't announced anything beyond that. All told, about 650 stores across the country will go dark.

Topshop

Fast-fashion chain Topshop is shutting all 11 of its stores in the U.S. The retailer's London-based parent company, Arcadia Group, filed for bankruptcy protection in May, citing ""challenging retail headwinds, changing consumer habits and ever-increasing online competition."" Topshop's U.S. stores are in major markets like New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Miami. The company hasn't yet said when it expects the 11 stores to close.

Party City

Party City plans to shut about 45 stores in the U.S. this year. That's more than normal. The party-supply retailer had been closing 10 to 15 stores, on average, annually. Following the announcement, some speculated a global helium shortage was straining its business of selling balloons for birthday parties, weddings and other special occasions. But the retailer said it was able to secure a new source of helium and that the decision to close more stores in 2019 was unrelated to the global shortage. Party City shares are down more than 28% this year.

Pier 1 Imports

Pier 1 Imports is planning to shut 57 stores in 2019, and potentially more. The home goods retailer in June said if it's ""unable to achieve our performance goals, sales targets and reductions in occupancies and other costs,"" it could shutter as much as 15% of its fleet. Pier 1 closed 30 stores in 2018, leaving it with about 1,000 locations in total across the U.S. Many shoppers have navigated to Amazon and other online retailers to buy things like dishes, wall art and the small furniture accessories that Pier 1 sells. The retailer's shares are up a little more than 1% for the year.

CVS

CVS is closing 46 of its ""underperforming"" locations across the country this year. That's still less than 1% of CVS' roughly 9,600 stores nationwide. But the drugstore chain, like many retailers today, must work toward culling its massive footprint and adding unique services to stores to keep customers coming back. As it shuts some stores, CVS is adding hundreds of SmileDirectClub shops inside certain CVS locations, offering shoppers a cheaper way to straighten their teeth. It's also opening up locations known as HealthHUBS that boast services and products like blood testing and sleep apnea machines. CVS' stock is down nearly 12% in 2019.

Gap

Gap Inc. is planning to shut 230 of its namesake brand's stores over the next two years. This fiscal year, Gap said it expects to close about 50 company-owned stores, net of any new openings or repositionings. The apparel retailer in February announced its plans to split its business into two publicly traded companies, one that includes Gap, Banana Republic, Intermix and its women's and men's athleisure brands Athleta and Hill City, and another with just Old Navy. Gap Inc. shares have fallen more than 27% this year.

Victoria's Secret

L Brands' Victoria's Secret is planning to shut 53 stores this year, as the lingerie retailer struggles to appeal to women with its outdated and over-the-top bras and underwear. On average, the company has been closing roughly 15 stores each year. Meantime, online-based lingerie brands like Adore Me and Lively are opening up stores, potentially making it more difficult for Victoria's Secret to win back market share. L Brands' stock is up about 3% year to date.

Bath & Body Works

L Brands' Bath & Body Works also has some closures planned. The retailer said it intends to shut two dozen locations this year. But it will also be opening 46 stores and renovating more than 170 locations. As Victoria's Secret's sales have been in a slump, Bath & Body Works has been a bright spot for L Brands. The company reported in May that Bath & Body Work's same-store sales surged 13% during the fiscal first quarter. The upbeat news led L Brands to hike its profit outlook for the full year.

Abercrombie & Fitch

Specialty apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. said it plans to close up to 40 stores during fiscal 2019, after closing 29 locations last year. The company has, meanwhile, been working toward reducing the size of its stores and remodeling existing locations. Abercrombie also said it plans to open additional stores this year, to make up for the closures, after opening 22 stores in 2018. It also owns the Hollister clothing brand. The retailer's stock has fallen roughly 10% in 2019.

Charlotte Russe

Teen apparel retailer Charlotte Russe is liquidating and closing all of its stores, after filing for bankruptcy protection in February. At the time, it was only planning to shut 94 stores. But now, the company will be closing more than 500 locations across the country, after a liquidator won the auction for its business in bankruptcy court. Many of its stores are found within shopping malls.

Payless ShoeSource

Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy in February and has started the process of shutting all 2,500 of its stores across North America. Payless struggled with a heavy debt load and also said in court documents it faced ""unanticipated"" delays from its suppliers in recent years that forced it to sell inventory at deep discounts. It's also fallen victim to more consumers shopping for footwear online.

Gymboree

When kids clothing company Gymboree filed for bankruptcy protection in January, it said it would close all 800 of its Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores. It's since sold the rights associated with both Gymboree and its Crazy 8 brand to Children's Place, while Gap has acquired Gymboree's Janie and Jack brand's intellectual property, its website, customer data and other assets.

Family Dollar

Discount chain Dollar Tree said it plans to close 390 Family Dollar stores this year while it renovates 1,000 other locations. After buying Family Dollar in 2015, Dollar Tree has been left with the task of improving the appearance of those stores, many of which are run down. It's also been trying to cut costs. Dollar Tree shares are up more than 24% year to date.

Chico's

Women's clothing retailer Chico's said it will shut between 60 to 80 stores in fiscal 2019. The company overall intends to close at least 250 stores in the U.S. over the next three years. It joins a list of apparel companies that are struggling to stay afloat, as more sales move online and shoppers are lured to fast-fashion brands like Zara. Chico's shares have tumbled more than 38% this year.

Drew Angerer | Getty Images

The store closures just keep coming, from Dressbarn, CVS, Party City, Pier 1 Imports and more. Already, more than 7,150 store closures have been announced by U.S. retailers in 2019, according to Coresight Research. And it's not even June. Last year, Coresight tracked 5,524 store closures, down more than 30% from an all-time record 8,139 closures announced in 2017. Meanwhile, Coresight has tracked 2,726 store opening announcements so far this year.

With the threat of additional tariffs taking effect on consumer-facing goods like apparel and footwear imported from China hanging over retailers, things could get even worse, according to one analyst. UBS' Jay Sole recently said in a note to clients: ""The market is not realizing how much brick & mortar retail is incrementally struggling and how new 25% tariffs could force widespread store closures. ... We think potential 25% tariffs on Chinese imports could accelerate pressure on these [companies'] profit margins to the point where major store closures become a real possibility."" The store closures already announced this year also mean more bad news for U.S. mall owners, which have already been struggling with traffic to department stores, their anchor tenants, largely on the demise. So these mall owners are having to get creative, bringing in more food options, and even apartments and office spaces, to their properties. Here are some of the biggest retailers that have announced store closures so far this year.

Dressbarn, owned by Ascena Retail Group, is going out of business. There's no timeline yet on when Dressbarn's roughly 650 stores across the country are expected to shut. But Ascena said it's beginning to wind down that business entirely, and then will turn its focus to its more profitable brands Ann Taylor and Loft.

Fred's

Fred's said in April that by the end of this month, it will have shut 159 stores across the U.S., or almost 30% of its fleet of 557 stores nationwide. The discount retailer said at the time, ""most of these stores have near‐term lease expirations and limited remaining lease obligations."" Then, just earlier this month, it said it plans to shutter another 104 Fred's stores by the end of June, bringing the total closures to 263. Fred's, which sells groceries and other everyday items like cleaning supplies, is another victim of e-commerce's ascent.

Qualcomm, Xilinx, Broadcom –Chipmakers were under pressure led by declines in Qualcomm and Xilinx, which tumbled 6% and 3.6%, respectively. Broadcom also dropped 6%. The drop came after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and effectively halted its ability to buy American-made parts and components. This led Google to suspended business activity with the Chinese telecom giant. Other Huawei suppliers, including Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel and Xilinx, will reportedly stop selling to the Huawei until further notice. U.S. chip suppliers are losing a big customer as Huawei purchases $20 billion of semiconductors each year.

Sprint, T-Mobile — Sprint shares surged 18.8% after the Federal Communications Commission's chairman said he would recommend the company's $26.5 billion merger with T-Mobile. T-Mobile shares also rose 3.9%.

Deutsche Bank — The German bank's U.S.-listed shares slid 2% after UBS downgraded it to sell from neutral. The UBS analyst said Deutsche is a ""levered market play vulnerable to external events and rising rates are currently a distant hope.""

Tesla — Tesla dropped 2.3% after a Wedbush analyst lowered its price target on the electric car maker's stock to $230 from $275. The analyst cited concerns that CEO Elon Musk's expansion into other products is distracting the company from what should be its main goal: gathering core demand for its Model 3.

Apple — Shares of Apple slid 3.1% after HSBC cut the tech company's price target to $174 per share from $180 due to concerns over the looming tariff concerns between the U.S. and China. HSBC believes tariff increases would force Apple to raise prices on its products, which are already seen as expensive. The bank also said there is a risk that Chinese consumers would shift to local brands with comparable products such as Huawei and Xiaomi.

Dish Network — Dish shares slid nearly 6% after announcing it will buy streaming company EchoStar's satellite business for $800 million. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019.

Tata Motors — Shares of Indian automaker Tata Motors climbed 5.7% following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings released before the bell Monday. Tata Motors earned $160.26 million in net profit for the quarter ended on March 31, topping a Refinitiv estimate. The company, however, said it struggled to sell its Jaguar Land Rover in key markets like China.

Delta Air Lines — Delta fell 1.1% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight. Morgan Stanley cited concerns that the airline's free cash flow yield is falling, and the investment bank's updated 2020 estimates which are below the consensus estimates.

Ryanair — Europe's low-cost airline Ryanair fell 2.1% after reporting its weakest annual profit in fours years on Monday. Ryanair cited issues with overcapacity, Brexit and problems with the grounded Boeing 737 MAX for its disappointing quarterly results.

Del Frisco's Restaurant — The steakhouse chain's stock skyrocketed 31.2% higher after The Deal reported that final bids for the company were around $9 per share. That number is 89.5% above Del Frisco's closing price on Friday of $4.75.

Looking for a new restaurant to try out before its lines get too long? Fishbowl Analytics has got you covered. The firm released its sixth annual list of emerging restaurant brands Tuesday. Past lists have tapped up-and-coming brands like Sweetgreen, which reached a valuation of $1 billion last year, and Shake Shack as chains to watch. The analytics firm rates brands using a combination of nominations, media mentions and social media buzz to curate its list, Fishbowl analyst Katharine Dalton said. To be considered, chains must have five to 75 locations. This year's list is one of its most diverse, representing a range of flavor profiles and restaurant concepts, Dalton said. But one characteristic that most of the chains have in common is their health-focused menus. According to Dalton, that's now the price of entry, not a distinguishing feature.

Millennials are all about experiences, according to marketing professionals. Punch Bowl Social aims to take advantage of that with a mix of dining and entertainment that echos Dave & Buster's. Customers can find corn hole, arcade games, pingpong tables and bowling lanes in its locations. The budding chain also offers a full food and drink menu when players need more sustenance. And if there isn't a location near you yet, there might be soon. The company has plans to add seven restaurants this year to its existing fleet of 16.
