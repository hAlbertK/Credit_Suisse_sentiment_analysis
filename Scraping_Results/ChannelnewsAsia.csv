REUTERS: Supercomputer manufacturer Cray Inc said on Friday it would be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co in a deal valued at about US$1.30 billion, net of cash.

The US$35 per share value represents a premium of 17.4per cent to Cray's last close.

HPE said it expects the deal to increase its footprint in federal business and academia, and sell supercomputing products to its commercial clients.

The deal, expected to close by the first quarter of HPE's fiscal year 2020, will add to its adjusted operating profit in the first full year after closing.

As part of the deal, HPE expects to incur one-time integration costs that will be absorbed within its fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook of US$1.9 billion to US$2.1 billion that remains unchanged.

Seattle-headquartered Cray has U.S.-based manufacturing operations and about 1,300 employees worldwide. It earned US$456 million in revenue in its last fiscal year.

WASHINGTON: The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday it was adding several Chinese companies and a government-owned institute involved in supercomputing with military applications to its national security ""entity list"" that bars them from buying U.S. parts and components without government approval.

The export restriction announcement adding the firms to what is effectively a trade blacklist is the latest effort by the Trump administration to restrict the ability of Chinese firms to gain access to U.S. technology amid an ongoing trade war.

The department said it was adding Sugon, the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology - along with numerous aliases of the five entities - to the list over concerns about military applications of the supercomputers they are developing.

Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology is owned by the 56th Research Institute of the General Staff of China's People's Liberation Army, the Commerce Department said, adding ""its mission is to support China's military modernization.""

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment.

China's state broadcaster, China Radio International, said in an editorial on Saturday that the move was one of a series of recent actions by the United States that violated the consensus reached by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina last December.

""No matter whether it is aimed at suppressing Chinese technology or its long-term economic development, or put pressure on China in the trade negotiations, the United States will not achieve its aims,"" it said.

In 2015, the Commerce Department added China's National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) to the list ""because of its use of U.S.-origin multicores, boards, and (co)processors to power supercomputers believed to support nuclear explosive simulation and military simulation activities.""

The Commerce Department said on Friday that since 2015 NUDT has procured items under the name Hunan Guofang Kei University using four separate, additional addresses not already on the entity list. The department said on Friday it is now adding Hunan Guofang and the four addresses to the list.

The companies ""pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,"" the Commerce Department said.

In May, the Trump administration added China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to the entity list and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that the United States could resolve complaints about Huawei as part of a trade deal.

The world's two largest economies have ratcheted up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China's unfair trade practices.

The United States, China, the European Union and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

In March, a U.S. government-led group said it was working with chipmaker Intel Corp and computermaker Cray Inc to develop and build the country's fastest computer by 2021 for conducting nuclear weapons and other research.

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois are working on a supercomputer dubbed ""Aurora with Intel,"" the world's biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The US$500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

Earlier this week, Nvidia Corp, a major chip supplier to supercomputer makers, said it was working with Softbank Holdings Group owned chip firm Arm Holdings to make its chips work with Arm's for supercomputers.

Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia's accelerated computing unit, said that the effort was aimed at European and Japanese customers rather than Chinese groups, which are increasingly turning to domestic chips.

""In terms of China, I think they've clearly stated that they have a domestic accelerator and processor strategy that they will pursue, and that’s clearly what they are doing,"" Buck said.

I'm one of those people who can't drive without music playing in the background. Maybe it's because I grew up in New York City, where cacophony is the underlying soundtrack to life. Or maybe it's because I'm just restless by nature or have an innate need to be entertained or to have one of my senses stimulated. But I'd never appreciated nor really understood the notion of ""comfortable silence"". To me, silence was just plain uncomfortable.

So logically, my kids grew up knowing that a car ride also meant it was time to play some tunes.

That was fine for the first few years of parenting. Mommy and I took turns playing whatever we were in the mood for (although Su-Lyn graciously usually let me choose). We figured we were giving the little ones a good education in music and they'd grow up influenced by our tastes.

But you know what they say about best laid plans. Because pretty quickly your sweet little children, who do whatever you want them to do (and listen to whatever you want them to listen to), start to become independent little people who want to assert their own ideas and opinions.

In the abstract, it’s a really good thing. As parents, you want your kids to become strong individuals that are able to assert themselves when necessary. I mean, none of us want to raise sheep.

In practice, however, dealing with an opinionated four-year-old, who wants to listen to the same song on repeat doesn't make you proud so much as it makes you want to cry.

I think I've listened to Elsa singing about her personal power problems so many times I know the lyrics better than most tween girls out there. And to make life even more amusing for me, and thanks (no thanks) to the wonders of Spotify, we now have Let It Go on her playlist in Mandarin, Korean and Japanese –for some reason, she wanted to hear the songs in these specific languages. What amazes me is the fact that she's actually able to sing along to a fair amount of these songs, in languages to which she isn't otherwise exposed.

In addition to Elsa, I'm tortured daily by her sister Anna, and fellow Disney princesses Moana, Ariel and Rapunzel (although I honestly kind of like Mandy Moore's songs in Tangled). Not to mention a bunch of singing psychedelic-coloured ponies, unicorns and alicorns.

Whenever my own princess is riding in the car, she not-so-politely tells me to put on her music. I suspect she takes great pleasure in telling me that “daddy's music is awful”.

And it's not just her. Neither of my children seem to appreciate my music tastes. My son also complains loudly when we get into the car and I put on one of my playlists. Not that his tastes are anything to be particularly proud of. The sole playlist he's created for himself on Spotify consists of a half dozen Pokemon-related songs, songs from the two Lego movies, a very random song by someone or some ones named Parry Fripp called I Love Bread, and Wise Master Wu from the Lego Ninjago movie. What is ridiculously amusing is that he doesn’t even particiularly like several of the Pokemon songs on his playlist – or know how some of the songs even got on there.

One song that he does enjoy tremendously, but I suspect more because of my reaction, is called the Pokemon Red And Blue Theme. It's nothing more than electronic sounds akin to video game noise. I completely hate this song. I can't even really call it a song. It's just noise, and annoying noise at that. He knows every time it plays I go a little cray-cray. These days, the minute I hear its opening beeps, I quickly skip to the next track.

When both kids are in the car, things can get a little heated. Both want to be in control of the music. If neither knows how to ask nicely, we'll often end up playing something that either my wife or I have chosen. Of course, all that means is we get two pissed off children instead of just one.

There’s more. What the kids love most – much to my annoyance and my wife's constant horror – is to treat me like their personal jukebox. They love choosing individual songs, calling them out to me from their seats, and asking me to put these in the queue. Of course, in the same way that my wife and I expect immediate responses when we ask them to do things for us, they now expect me to immediately do what they've asked. Which, when you're also the one driving is both difficult and a little dangerous. Far too many times I've had visions of crashing on the expressway while trying to queue up Part Of Your World for my demanding wannabe mermaid princess.

My kids probably think I'm a bit of an ass and a complete hypocrite (not that they know the word yet) because I'm constantly telling them to wait when they pop in their virtual quarters and make song requests. And while ""wait"" just means “wait until we get to a red light so I can safely (and legally) comply”, given the level of whining coming from behind, you'd think I asked the kids to wait until they were eighteen.

The irony of raising children is that sometimes the things you previously didn't like or couldn't understand, you now value and love. Like silence. When I've heard Pikachu sing ""pika"" for the thousandth time, all I really want – no, need – is a little comfortable silence."

REUTERS: Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC is in the lead to acquire Shutterfly Inc after making the highest offer for the U.S. digital imaging company, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

A deal would be the culmination of several years of private equity interest in Shutterfly, which allows customers to make photo books, cards and gifts from their photos. Its business has become increasingly commoditized and competitive, forcing it to explore a sale.

Apollo's exact offer could not be learned, but the deal would value Shutterfly at close to US$2 billion, excluding its debt pile of more than US$900 million, the sources said.

If the negotiations are completed successfully, a deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.

Apollo declined to comment, while Shutterfly did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shutterfly shares jumped 7per cent in pre-market trading in New York on the news on Monday to US$52.50.

Headquartered in Redwood City, California, Shutterfly makes personalized consumer photo products such as photo books, holiday cards, invitations and stationary.

Founded in 1999, Shutterfly faces increasing competition from other online digital photography services companies such as Snapfish and Vistaprint, as well as brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Costco and Target, that offer low-cost digital photography products and services.

Shutterfly was approached by several buyout firms over the years about a deal, including by Thomas H. Lee in 2016 and Silver Lake Partners LP in 2014, Reuters has previously reported.

In February, Shutterfly said its board had formed a committee to explore its options with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley after receiving acquisition interest from an undisclosed party. The company also announced that its Chief Executive Christopher North would leave the company in August.
