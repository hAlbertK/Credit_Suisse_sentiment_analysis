As a result, the stock has gained 6.4% in a month, outperforming the industry 's 3.7% growth. However, the company's dismal top-line performances over the past three quarters have been concerning. Let's delve deeper.

Factors Driving Growth

Marriott continues to impress investors with its solid bottom-line performance. In third-quarter 2018, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.70 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 and increased 62% year over year. Notably, Marriott's earnings have topped the consensus mark for the 17 straight quarters. As a result, the company raised its 2018 earnings view. Currently, it anticipates the metric in the band of $6.15-$6.18 per share, up from $5.81-$5.91 estimated earlier. Earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 5.1% upward over the past 30 days.

RevPAR in North America rose 3% in the third quarter. Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, Marriott is well-poised to grow in the near as well as long term. With global travel estimated to witness a CAGR of 7% over the next 10 years and international trips are anticipated to top 1.8 billion by 2030.

Moreover, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Moving ahead, the company plans to significantly expand its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. For 2018, Marriott anticipates 7% net room growth, which is likely to continue building economics, scale, and consumer preference for its brands.

Earlier, Marriott announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company's loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent. Additionally, it will offer members more than what was promised by the prior programs. Notably, the company's total loyalty membership has increased to 120 million.

Starting 2019, Marriott will implement a fresh program services fee structure for owners, which will help the company to manage cost for programs and services.

Concerns

Marriott's lower-than-expected top-line performance over the past three quarters have disappointed investors. The company's revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first, second and third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, total revenues came in at $5.05 billion, which fell short of the consensus mark of $5.37 billion and declined 0.6% from the year-ago quarter figure.

Meanwhile, in the domestic market, the company is facing competition in New York due to a continuous increase in supply of hotels, which is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR in the region. On the whole, although leisure demand remains strong, cautious corporate, group and transient demand raises concern.

Marriott, which shares space with Choice Hotels International, Inc. CHH , has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Key Picks

Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Belmond Ltd. BEL and Peak Resorts, Inc. SKIS , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Belmond and Peak Resorts current-year earnings are expected to grow by 150% and 342.9%, respectively.

The property marks Hyatt's second management agreement with Tamdeen Group, one of the largest privately held conglomerates in Kuwait.

The new property is under renovation and is likely to open in January 2019. It is in close proximity to Kuwait International Airport that will provide easy connectivity to business travelers. Meanwhile, Grand Hyatt Kuwait, the company's first collaboration with the group, will be launched in 2020.

The latest move underscores Hyatt's efforts to expand and strengthen its Regency brand in the Middle East. Meanwhile, shares of Hyatt have declined 1.2% compared with the industry's decline of 17.6% in a year.

Continual Expansion - A Major Growth Driver

Hyatt continues to expand its presence in Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Meanwhile, the company's new brand signings globally have consistently outpaced its openings and this trend is expected to continue. Hyatt registered net room growth of 7.6% on a year-over-year basis in third-quarter 2018, which marked the 14th successive quarter of growth above 6%.

The company's development pipeline grew roughly 6% in the third quarter compared with the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company expects to grow units on a net room basis by roughly 6.5-7%. As of Sep 30, 2018, the company entered into management or franchise contracts for around 340 hotels or 73,000 rooms.

Meanwhile, the recent hotel addition should fortify the Hyatt Regency brand's global presence and boost revenues from EAME/SW Asia Management and Franchising segment. In fact, in the third quarter of 2018, revenues at the segment increased 17% (21.1% in a constant currency) year over year to $21 million.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer-Discretionary sector are Belmond Ltd. BEL , Peak Resorts, Inc. SKIS and DISH Network Corporation DISH . While both Belmond and Peak Resorts carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DISH Network carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Belmond has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 150%.

Peak Resorts has an expected 2019 earnings growth rate of 342.9%.

DISH Network has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 11.8%.

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

It's not the one you think.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen t earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

Shutterfly Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Miss

Shutterfly reported mixed fourth-quarter 2018 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line lagged the same. Notably, this marked the company's eighth straight quarter o f earnings beat, while revenues missed estimates for the second straight quarter. Adjusted earnings came in at $5.47 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $5.28. The bottom line also surged 75.9% on a year-over-year basis.

Net revenues totaled $950 million, which improved 60% year over year but fell short of the consensus mark of $956 million. The sharp increase in the top line was primarily owing to robust performance by the Lifetouch and Business Solutions segment, offset by a lower-than-expected Shutterfly Consumer segment revenues. Notably, fourth-quarter earnings marked the 72st consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue growth.

Revenues in Detail

Revenues at the Consumers category amounted to $528 million, up 1% year over year. The segment's lower-than-expected performance was due to a 17% decline at Tiny Prints boutique. However, Shutterfly brand revenues increased 3% during the quarter.

The Lifetouch segment generated revenues of $348 million. This segment was formed following the acquisition of Lifetouch. Revenues from the Shutterfly Business Solutions (SBS) segment rose 3% year over year to $74 million.

Unique customers declined 1% year over year to 6.1 million and total orders decreased 7% year over year to 9.8 million. Meanwhile, average order value increased 8% to $54.03 backed by better product mix and larger basket size.

Operating Performance

Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter was 60.3%, which was below the midpoint of the company's guidance due to lower consumer revenues. Shutterfly Consumer gross margin contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 62.1% primarily due to lower volumes, pricing pressure and product mix.

However, Lifetouch gross margin was 67.4%, in line with the company's expectation. Shutterfly Business Solutions' gross margin expanded 120 bps to 19.4% on reduction in technology related expenses.

The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $319.8 million, which was below the company's expectation. Operating expenses totaled $313.4 million.

Balance Sheet

Shutterfly exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $521.6 million compared with $489.9 million at the end of 2017. Accounts receivables summed $87 million, down from $82.3 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Long-term debt totaled approximately $1,090.4 million compared with $292.5 million at the end of 2017.

1Q19 Guidance

For first-quarter 2019, net revenues are projected between $317 million and $328 million. Gross profit margin is estimated in the range of 35.8-36.7%. Adjusted EBITDA loss is anticipated in the $43-$48 million band. Operating loss is envisioned in the $102-$107 million range. Also, Shutterfly Consumer revenues are projected in the band of $146-150 million, while the same from Shutterfly Business Solutions are likely to be between $45 million and $48 million. Lifetouch revenues are envisioned in the $126-$130 million range.

2019 View

Net revenues are estimated to be between $2,130 million and $2,210 million. Gross profit margin is expected to be in the 51.4-51.7% range. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $315-$340 million. Operating income is envisioned in the $76-$101 million range. Also, Shutterfly Consumer revenues are projected in the band of $975-1,025 million, while the same from Shutterfly Business Solutions are likely to be between $240 million and $250 million. Lifetouch revenues are envisioned in the $915-$935 million range.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -35.86% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

Currently, Shutterfly has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Shutterfly has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

Shares of Shutterfly, Inc . (NASDAQ: SFLY) , a leading retailer and manufacturing platform of high-quality personalized products including photo books, gifts, home decoration, cards and stationery, among other items, are down 10% after mixed fourth-quarter results and the departure of its CEO.

So what

The company's net revenue checked in at $950 million during the fourth quarter, falling short of analyst estimates calling for $956 million. Adjusted earnings per share reached $5.47, higher than analyst estimates calling for $5.28 per share. The weaker top-line result would have been worse without a strong quarter from Lifetouch, Shutterfly's 2018 acquisition , but was offset by a weaker performance from Shutterfly Consumer segment revenues.

Alongside Shutterfly announcing mixed fourth-quarter results, the company dropped another bombshell as Christopher North, President and CEO, announced he would be stepping down from his roles at the end of August 2019. ""On behalf of the Board, I want to express our thanks to Chris for his leadership of the Company and important accomplishments since joining in 2016. We also appreciate his willingness to provide time to effect a seamless transition to our next CEO,"" said Will Lansing, Chairman of the Board of Shutterfly, in a press release.

Now what

But wait, investors, there's more to digest from Shutterfly's slew of announcements. Shutterfly's board of directors has formed a Strategic Review Committee, with Morgan Stanley as financial advisor, in hopes of reviewing strategic alternatives for its business going forward. The fourth quarter was a tough one for the company, as the holiday season was more competitive than anticipated, especially at a time when the core paper-based products category is less relevant than in the past. The company's business turnaround remains elusive.

As a result, the stock has gained 6.4% in a month, outperforming the industry 's 3.7% growth. However, the company's dismal top-line performances over the past three quarters have been concerning. Let's delve deeper.

Factors Driving Growth

Marriott continues to impress investors with its solid bottom-line performance. In third-quarter 2018, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.70 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 and increased 62% year over year. Notably, Marriott's earnings have topped the consensus mark for the 17 straight quarters. As a result, the company raised its 2018 earnings view. Currently, it anticipates the metric in the band of $6.15-$6.18 per share, up from $5.81-$5.91 estimated earlier. Earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 5.1% upward over the past 30 days.

RevPAR in North America rose 3% in the third quarter. Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, Marriott is well-poised to grow in the near as well as long term. With global travel estimated to witness a CAGR of 7% over the next 10 years and international trips are anticipated to top 1.8 billion by 2030.

Moreover, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Moving ahead, the company plans to significantly expand its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. For 2018, Marriott anticipates 7% net room growth, which is likely to continue building economics, scale, and consumer preference for its brands.

Earlier, Marriott announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company's loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent. Additionally, it will offer members more than what was promised by the prior programs. Notably, the company's total loyalty membership has increased to 120 million.

Starting 2019, Marriott will implement a fresh program services fee structure for owners, which will help the company to manage cost for programs and services.

Concerns

Marriott's lower-than-expected top-line performance over the past three quarters have disappointed investors. The company's revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first, second and third quarter of 2018. In the second quarter, total revenues came in at $5.05 billion, which fell short of the consensus mark of $5.37 billion and declined 0.6% from the year-ago quarter figure.

Meanwhile, in the domestic market, the company is facing competition in New York due to a continuous increase in supply of hotels, which is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR in the region. On the whole, although leisure demand remains strong, cautious corporate, group and transient demand raises concern.

The property marks Hyatt's second management agreement with Tamdeen Group, one of the largest privately held conglomerates in Kuwait.

The new property is under renovation and is likely to open in January 2019. It is in close proximity to Kuwait International Airport that will provide easy connectivity to business travelers. Meanwhile, Grand Hyatt Kuwait, the company's first collaboration with the group, will be launched in 2020.

The latest move underscores Hyatt's efforts to expand and strengthen its Regency brand in the Middle East. Meanwhile, shares of Hyatt have declined 1.2% compared with the industry's decline of 17.6% in a year.

Continual Expansion - A Major Growth Driver

Hyatt continues to expand its presence in Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Meanwhile, the company's new brand signings globally have consistently outpaced its openings and this trend is expected to continue. Hyatt registered net room growth of 7.6% on a year-over-year basis in third-quarter 2018, which marked the 14th successive quarter of growth above 6%.

The company's development pipeline grew roughly 6% in the third quarter compared with the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company expects to grow units on a net room basis by roughly 6.5-7%. As of Sep 30, 2018, the company entered into management or franchise contracts for around 340 hotels or 73,000 rooms.

Meanwhile, the recent hotel addition should fortify the Hyatt Regency brand's global presence and boost revenues from EAME/SW Asia Management and Franchising segment. In fact, in the third quarter of 2018, revenues at the segment increased 17% (21.1% in a constant currency) year over year to $21 million.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer-Discretionary sector are Belmond Ltd. BEL , Peak Resorts, Inc. SKIS and DISH Network Corporation DISH . While both Belmond and Peak Resorts carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DISH Network carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Belmond has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 150%.

Peak Resorts has an expected 2019 earnings growth rate of 342.9%.

DISH Network has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 11.8%.

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

It's not the one you think.

Shares have lost about 0.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Shutterfly due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen t earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

Shutterfly Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Miss

Shutterfly reported mixed fourth-quarter 2018 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line lagged the same. Notably, this marked the company's eighth straight quarter o f earnings beat, while revenues missed estimates for the second straight quarter. Adjusted earnings came in at $5.47 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $5.28. The bottom line also surged 75.9% on a year-over-year basis.

Net revenues totaled $950 million, which improved 60% year over year but fell short of the consensus mark of $956 million. The sharp increase in the top line was primarily owing to robust performance by the Lifetouch and Business Solutions segment, offset by a lower-than-expected Shutterfly Consumer segment revenues. Notably, fourth-quarter earnings marked the 72st consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue growth.

Revenues in Detail

Revenues at the Consumers category amounted to $528 million, up 1% year over year. The segment's lower-than-expected performance was due to a 17% decline at Tiny Prints boutique. However, Shutterfly brand revenues increased 3% during the quarter.

The Lifetouch segment generated revenues of $348 million. This segment was formed following the acquisition of Lifetouch. Revenues from the Shutterfly Business Solutions (SBS) segment rose 3% year over year to $74 million.

Unique customers declined 1% year over year to 6.1 million and total orders decreased 7% year over year to 9.8 million. Meanwhile, average order value increased 8% to $54.03 backed by better product mix and larger basket size.

Operating Performance

Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter was 60.3%, which was below the midpoint of the company's guidance due to lower consumer revenues. Shutterfly Consumer gross margin contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 62.1% primarily due to lower volumes, pricing pressure and product mix.

However, Lifetouch gross margin was 67.4%, in line with the company's expectation. Shutterfly Business Solutions' gross margin expanded 120 bps to 19.4% on reduction in technology related expenses.

The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $319.8 million, which was below the company's expectation. Operating expenses totaled $313.4 million.

Balance Sheet

Shutterfly exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $521.6 million compared with $489.9 million at the end of 2017. Accounts receivables summed $87 million, down from $82.3 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Long-term debt totaled approximately $1,090.4 million compared with $292.5 million at the end of 2017.

1Q19 Guidance

For first-quarter 2019, net revenues are projected between $317 million and $328 million. Gross profit margin is estimated in the range of 35.8-36.7%. Adjusted EBITDA loss is anticipated in the $43-$48 million band. Operating loss is envisioned in the $102-$107 million range. Also, Shutterfly Consumer revenues are projected in the band of $146-150 million, while the same from Shutterfly Business Solutions are likely to be between $45 million and $48 million. Lifetouch revenues are envisioned in the $126-$130 million range.

2019 View

Net revenues are estimated to be between $2,130 million and $2,210 million. Gross profit margin is expected to be in the 51.4-51.7% range. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $315-$340 million. Operating income is envisioned in the $76-$101 million range. Also, Shutterfly Consumer revenues are projected in the band of $975-1,025 million, while the same from Shutterfly Business Solutions are likely to be between $240 million and $250 million. Lifetouch revenues are envisioned in the $915-$935 million range.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -35.86% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

Currently, Shutterfly has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Shutterfly has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

Shares of Shutterfly, Inc . (NASDAQ: SFLY) , a leading retailer and manufacturing platform of high-quality personalized products including photo books, gifts, home decoration, cards and stationery, among other items, are down 10% after mixed fourth-quarter results and the departure of its CEO.

So what

The company's net revenue checked in at $950 million during the fourth quarter, falling short of analyst estimates calling for $956 million. Adjusted earnings per share reached $5.47, higher than analyst estimates calling for $5.28 per share. The weaker top-line result would have been worse without a strong quarter from Lifetouch, Shutterfly's 2018 acquisition , but was offset by a weaker performance from Shutterfly Consumer segment revenues.

Alongside Shutterfly announcing mixed fourth-quarter results, the company dropped another bombshell as Christopher North, President and CEO, announced he would be stepping down from his roles at the end of August 2019. ""On behalf of the Board, I want to express our thanks to Chris for his leadership of the Company and important accomplishments since joining in 2016. We also appreciate his willingness to provide time to effect a seamless transition to our next CEO,"" said Will Lansing, Chairman of the Board of Shutterfly, in a press release.

Now what

But wait, investors, there's more to digest from Shutterfly's slew of announcements. Shutterfly's board of directors has formed a Strategic Review Committee, with Morgan Stanley as financial advisor, in hopes of reviewing strategic alternatives for its business going forward. The fourth quarter was a tough one for the company, as the holiday season was more competitive than anticipated, especially at a time when the core paper-based products category is less relevant than in the past. The company's business turnaround remains elusive.
