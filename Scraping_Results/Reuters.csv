In recent years, the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and the STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko, Canadian and Kingfisher) basins drew producers and private equity firms willing to wager billions of dollars on what many considered the next Permian basin, the largest and most prolific U.S. oilfield.

(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2R3NhN5)

But while their many layers of oil mimicked the Permian, the region’s geology proved more inconsistent, undercutting results and making it a higher-cost U.S. shale area for producers.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc, which turned a $3.8 billion investment in the oilfield into under $30 million in just two years, last month said it may not be able to pay creditors.

Others are downsizing: Devon Energy Corp, for example, cut capital spending earmarked for its STACK position to 20% of the total in 2019 from 31% in 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on company presentations. The reallocation aims to improve cash flow from the STACK while focusing investment where returns are better, spokesman Tim Hartley said.

Cimarex Energy also forecasts a cut in spending, to 15% in the region in 2019, down from 30% last year, company presentations showed.

“Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year,” Thomas Jorden, chief executive of Cimarex, said in a first-quarter earnings call.

Producers also are narrowing development to areas where wells have produced better results: Marathon Oil Corp and Continental Resources both have anchored recent activity on two sub-areas - the STACK-Meramec and the SCOOP Woodford.

STRUGGLERS

Geology has stymied hopes for a “Permian Jr”: Exploration wells pointed toward uniform rocks that produced high levels of oil, but producers instead encountered more complexity underground, and production weighted toward gas - at a time of a global glut and stubbornly low prices for the commodity.

“The SCOOP/STACK is not a traditional shale play, so when you think about developing it, there are a number of different rock types,” said Denise Yee, vice president at consultancy RS Energy Group. “As it’s so complex, the hydrocarbon mix changes across the play, and the oil window is limited.”

Another disappointment has been poorer results from subsequent wells. Perhaps more than any other U.S. shale basin, the SCOOP/STACK has suffered from a condition known as the “parent/child” well problem, where secondary wells produce less oil than the original.

These problems are reflected in a higher median breakeven price needed to cover costs in the SCOOP and STACK, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

(Reuters) - Supercomputer manufacturer Cray Inc said on Friday it would be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co in a deal valued at about $1.30 billion, net of cash.

The $35 per share value represents a premium of 17.4% to Cray’s last close.

HPE said it expects the deal to increase its footprint in federal business and academia, and sell supercomputing products to its commercial clients.

The deal, expected to close by the first quarter of HPE’s fiscal year 2020, will add to its adjusted operating profit in the first full year after closing.

As part of the deal, HPE expects to incur one-time integration costs that will be absorbed within its fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion that remains unchanged.

Seattle-headquartered Cray has U.S.-based manufacturing operations and about 1,300 employees worldwide. It earned $456 million in revenue in its last fiscal year.

Cray’s supercomputing systems can handle massive data sets, converged modeling, simulation, artificial intelligence, and analytics workloads."

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago said they are working on a supercomputer dubbed Aurora with Intel, the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

If the project succeeds, Aurora would represent nearly an order of magnitude leap over existing machines that feature so-called petaflop performance, capable of doing 1 quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations a second.

It also heightens the stakes in a race in which the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

One of Aurora’s primary functions would be simulating nuclear blasts, a pillar of weapons development since the ban of live detonation testings.

Aurora will be built with artificial intelligence capabilities for projects such as developing better battery materials and helping the Veterans Administration prevent suicides, Rick Stevens, an associate lab director with Argonne overseeing the exascale computing project, said during a news briefing.

The project is a win for Intel, which will supply its Xeon CPU chips and Optane memory chips for Aurora.

Intel has been fending off rival U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp’s rise in the chip content of supercomputers as the machines take on more artificial intelligence work. Nvidia’s chips are found in five of the world’s current top-10 supercomputers, though the Nvidia chips are found alongside chips from its rivals, according to TOP500, which ranks the machines.

The world’s current most powerful machine, the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, contains chips from International Business Machines Corp and Nvidia.

The source of chips for supercomputers has become a factor in trade tensions between the United States and China. The world’s third-fastest supercomputer - the Sunway TaihuLight in China - has chips developed domestically in China.

Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner who studies the supercomputing market, said that despite the small contract size relative to Intel’s overall revenue, the work done on Aurora will eventually filter down to the company’s commercial customers.

“It’s not just a jingoistic race between the U.S. and China,” Dekate said. “The innovations that Intel is developing here will percolate down to other parts of its business.”"

The export restriction announcement adding the firms to what is effectively a trade blacklist is the latest effort by the Trump administration to restrict the ability of Chinese firms to gain access to U.S. technology amid an ongoing trade war.

The department said it was adding Sugon, the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology - along with numerous aliases of the five entities - to the list over concerns about military applications of the supercomputers they are developing.

Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology is owned by the 56th Research Institute of the General Staff of China’s People’s Liberation Army, the Commerce Department said, adding “its mission is to support China’s military modernization.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment.

China’s state broadcaster, China Radio International, said in an editorial on Saturday that the move was one of a series of recent actions by the United States that violated the consensus reached by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina last December.

“No matter whether it is aimed at suppressing Chinese technology or its long-term economic development, or put pressure on China in the trade negotiations, the United States will not achieve its aims,” it said.

In 2015, the Commerce Department added China’s National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) to the list “because of its use of U.S.-origin multicores, boards, and (co)processors to power supercomputers believed to support nuclear explosive simulation and military simulation activities.”

The Commerce Department said on Friday that since 2015 NUDT has procured items under the name Hunan Guofang Kei University using four separate, additional addresses not already on the entity list. The department said on Friday it is now adding Hunan Guofang and the four addresses to the list.

The companies “pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,” the Commerce Department said.

In May, the Trump administration added China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to the entity list and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that the United States could resolve complaints about Huawei as part of a trade deal.

The world’s two largest economies have ratcheted up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China’s unfair trade practices.

The United States, China, the European Union and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

In March, a U.S. government-led group said it was working with chipmaker Intel Corp and computermaker Cray Inc to develop and build the country’s fastest computer by 2021 for conducting nuclear weapons and other research.

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois are working on a supercomputer dubbed “Aurora with Intel,” the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

Earlier this week, Nvidia Corp, a major chip supplier to supercomputer makers, said it was working with Softbank Holdings Group owned chip firm Arm Holdings to make its chips work with Arm’s for supercomputers.

Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia’s accelerated computing unit, said that the effort was aimed at European and Japanese customers rather than Chinese groups, which are increasingly turning to domestic chips.

“In terms of China, I think they’ve clearly stated that they have a domestic accelerator and processor strategy that they will pursue, and that’s clearly what they are doing,” Buck said."

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred’s said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

By Uday Sampath Kumar

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Early gains on Wall Street fizzled out by afternoon on Monday as losses in technology and healthcare stocks overshadowed increased expectations of stimulus from central banks around the world.

Microsoft Corp and Amgen Inc were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Amgen fell 3.19% after analysts raised questions about data on the company’s lung cancer drug, dragging the healthcare sector down 0.94%.

Lenders, however, were up on broad gains in U.S. Treasury yields on risings bets of an interest rate cut in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s September meeting.

Financial stocks rose 1.20%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, with banks gaining 2.62%. Technology stocks fell more than 1% and were the biggest drag on the benchmark index.

“The markets are continuing last week’s positive sentiment but with a reduction in pessimism and fear,” said Scott Brown chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Stocks gained last week on easing U.S.-China trade negotiations and global political tensions as well as increased hopes of an interest rate cut.

Cementing those expectations, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said late last week the central bank would “act as appropriate” to sustain economic expansion, a phrase that financial markets have read as a sign of an impending of rate cut.

Earlier on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not see the threat of a recession as the Trump administration seeks to revive trade negotiations with China, adding that he expected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy.

Energy stocks led gains among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors with a 1.41% rise, as oil prices got a boost from the new Saudi energy minister committing to output cuts.

At 13:11 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.95 points, or 0.08%, at 26,818.41, the S&P 500 was down 2.34 points, or 0.08%, at 2,976.37 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 22.49 points, or 0.28%, at 8,080.59.

Among other stocks, AT&T Inc gained 2.61% after shareholder Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and pushed for changes.

Boeing Co fell 0.84% after it suspended load testing of its new widebody 777X aircraft over the weekend as media reports said a cargo door failed in a ground stress test.

Shares of Fred’s Inc plunged 50.82% to a record low after the discount retailer said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.44-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

In recent years, the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and the STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko, Canadian and Kingfisher) basins drew producers and private equity firms willing to wager billions of dollars on what many considered the next Permian basin, the largest and most prolific U.S. oilfield.

(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2R3NhN5)

But while their many layers of oil mimicked the Permian, the region’s geology proved more inconsistent, undercutting results and making it a higher-cost U.S. shale area for producers.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc, which turned a $3.8 billion investment in the oilfield into under $30 million in just two years, last month said it may not be able to pay creditors.

Others are downsizing: Devon Energy Corp, for example, cut capital spending earmarked for its STACK position to 20% of the total in 2019 from 31% in 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on company presentations. The reallocation aims to improve cash flow from the STACK while focusing investment where returns are better, spokesman Tim Hartley said.

Cimarex Energy also forecasts a cut in spending, to 15% in the region in 2019, down from 30% last year, company presentations showed.

“Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year,” Thomas Jorden, chief executive of Cimarex, said in a first-quarter earnings call.

Producers also are narrowing development to areas where wells have produced better results: Marathon Oil Corp and Continental Resources both have anchored recent activity on two sub-areas - the STACK-Meramec and the SCOOP Woodford.

STRUGGLERS

Geology has stymied hopes for a “Permian Jr”: Exploration wells pointed toward uniform rocks that produced high levels of oil, but producers instead encountered more complexity underground, and production weighted toward gas - at a time of a global glut and stubbornly low prices for the commodity.

“The SCOOP/STACK is not a traditional shale play, so when you think about developing it, there are a number of different rock types,” said Denise Yee, vice president at consultancy RS Energy Group. “As it’s so complex, the hydrocarbon mix changes across the play, and the oil window is limited.”

Another disappointment has been poorer results from subsequent wells. Perhaps more than any other U.S. shale basin, the SCOOP/STACK has suffered from a condition known as the “parent/child” well problem, where secondary wells produce less oil than the original.

These problems are reflected in a higher median breakeven price needed to cover costs in the SCOOP and STACK, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

Del Frisco’s, which owns Eagle Steak House and Frisco’s Grille chains, said its shareholders will receive $8 per share, which represents a premium of 18.9% to Friday’s close.

Including debt, the deal is valued at $650 million. As of March 26, the company had $336.1 million in debt.

Del Frisco’s shares were up 17.4% before the bell at $7.90, slightly below Catterton’s offer price.

The restaurant chain in December said it was evaluating options for its business, including a possible sale, amid pressure from activist investor Engaged Capital, the company’s third-largest shareholder with a near 10% stake.

Engaged Capital pushed Del Frisco’s to add a board member, saying the company’s steakhouse restaurants were poorly managed and had rushed into buying two chains to avoid an acquisition.

Del Frisco’s said on Monday Engaged has agreed to vote in favor of the acquisition, which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019.

The company bought two restaurants - Barcelona and bartaco - for $325 million in cash last year, even as traffic declined in its own restaurants.

Upon closing of the deal, L Catterton said it plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona businesses separately from the steakhouse brands.

L Catterton has also invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin’ Brands Inc, Unclue Julio’s Mexican restaurants, P.F. Chang’s and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Piper Jaffray & Co was the financial adviser to Del Frisco’s, while Credit Suisse served as financial adviser to L Catterton."

"Shutterfly, Inc. | SFLY",Reuters,https://news.google.com./articles/CAIiEJS1TcFeGpA2Th-CDAk657IqFggEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMNT5lwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2019-05-13T07:00:00Z,2019-10-07-13-23,Exclusive: Amazon rolls out machines that pack orders and replace jobs,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is rolling out machines to automate a job held by thousands of its workers: boxing up customer orders.

The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years, which scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelops them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters.

Amazon has considered installing two machines at dozens more warehouses, removing at least 24 roles at each one, these people said. These facilities typically employ more than 2,000 people.

That would amount to more than 1,300 cuts across 55 U.S. fulfillment centers for standard-sized inventory. Amazon would expect to recover the costs in under two years, at $1 million per machine plus operational expenses, they said.

The plan, previously unreported, shows how Amazon is pushing to reduce labor and boost profits as automation of the most common warehouse task – picking up an item – is still beyond its reach. The changes are not finalized because vetting technology before a major deployment can take a long time.

Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.

“We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. “We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.”

(Dave Clark is Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations)

Amazon last month downplayed its automation efforts to press visiting its Baltimore fulfillment center, saying a fully robotic future was far off. Its employee base has grown to become one of the largest in the United States, as the company opened new warehouses and raised wages to attract staff in a tight labor market.

A key to its goal of a leaner workforce is attrition, one of the sources said. Rather than lay off workers, the person said, the world’s largest online retailer will one day refrain from refilling packing roles. Those have high turnover because boxing multiple orders per minute over 10 hours is taxing work. At the same time, employees that stay with the company can be trained to take up more technical roles.

The new machines, known as the CartonWrap from Italian firm CMC Srl, pack much faster than humans. They crank out 600 to 700 boxes per hour, or four to five times the rate of a human packer, the sources said. The machines require one person to load customer orders, another to stock cardboard and glue and a technician to fix jams on occasion.

CMC declined to comment.

Though Amazon has announced it intends to speed up shipping across its Prime loyalty program, this latest round of automation is not focused on speed. “It’s truly about efficiency and savings,” one of the people said.

Including other machines known as the “SmartPac,” which the company rolled out recently to mail items in patented envelopes, Amazon’s technology suite will be able to automate a majority of its human packers. Five rows of workers at a facility can turn into two, supplemented by two CMC machines and one SmartPac, the person said.

The company describes this as an effort to “re-purpose” workers, the person said.

It could not be learned where roles might disappear first and what incentives, if any, are tied to those specific jobs.

But the hiring deals that Amazon has with governments are often generous. For the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last year in Alabama, for instance, the state promised the company $48.7 million over 10 years, its department of commerce said.

PICKING CHALLENGE

Amazon is not alone in testing CMC’s packing technology. JD.com Inc and Shutterfly Inc have used the machines as well, the companies said, as has Walmart Inc, according to a person familiar with its pilot.

Walmart started 3.5 years ago and has since installed the machines in several U.S. locations, the person said. The company declined to comment.

Interest in boxing technology sheds light on how the e-commerce behemoths are approaching one of the major problems in the logistics industry today: finding a robotic hand that can grasp diverse items without breaking them.

Amazon employs countless workers at each fulfillment center who do variations of this same task. Some stow inventory, while others pick customer orders and still others grab those orders, placing them in the right size box and taping them up.

Many venture-backed companies and university researchers are racing to automate this work. While advances in artificial intelligence are improving machines’ accuracy, there is still no guarantee that robotic hands can prevent a marmalade jar from slipping and breaking, or switch seamlessly from picking up an eraser to grabbing a vacuum cleaner.

Amazon has tested different vendors’ technology that it may one day use for picking, including from Soft Robotics, a Boston-area startup that drew inspiration from octopus tentacles to make grippers more versatile, one person familiar with Amazon’s experimentation said. Soft Robotics declined to comment on its work with Amazon but said it has handled a wide and ever-changing variety of products for multiple large retailers.

Believing that grasping technology is not ready for prime time, Amazon is automating around that problem when packing customer orders. Humans still place items on a conveyor, but machines then build boxes around them and take care of the sealing and labeling. This saves money not just by reducing labor but by reducing wasted packing materials as well.

These machines are not without flaws. CMC can only produce so many per year. They need a technician on site who can fix problems as they arise, a requirement Amazon would rather do without, the two sources said. The super-hot glue closing the boxes can pile up and halt a machine.

Still other types of automation, like the robotic grocery assembly system of Ocado Group PLC, are the focus of much industry interest.

But the boxing machines are already proving helpful to Amazon. The company has installed them in busy warehouses that are driving distance from Seattle, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Manchester and elsewhere, the people said.

The machines have the potential to automate far more than 24 jobs per facility, one of the sources said. The company is also setting up nearly two dozen more U.S. fulfillment centers for small and non-specialty inventory, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which could be ripe for the machines.

This is just a harbinger of automation to come.

“A ‘lights out’ warehouse is ultimately the goal,” one of the people said."

In recent years, the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and the STACK (Sooner Trend, Anadarko, Canadian and Kingfisher) basins drew producers and private equity firms willing to wager billions of dollars on what many considered the next Permian basin, the largest and most prolific U.S. oilfield.

But while their many layers of oil mimicked the Permian, the region’s geology proved more inconsistent, undercutting results and making it a higher-cost U.S. shale area for producers.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc, which turned a $3.8 billion investment in the oilfield into under $30 million in just two years, last month said it may not be able to pay creditors.

Others are downsizing: Devon Energy Corp, for example, cut capital spending earmarked for its STACK position to 20% of the total in 2019 from 31% in 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on company presentations. The reallocation aims to improve cash flow from the STACK while focusing investment where returns are better, spokesman Tim Hartley said.

Cimarex Energy also forecasts a cut in spending, to 15% in the region in 2019, down from 30% last year, company presentations showed.

“Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year,” Thomas Jorden, chief executive of Cimarex, said in a first-quarter earnings call.

Producers also are narrowing development to areas where wells have produced better results: Marathon Oil Corp and Continental Resources both have anchored recent activity on two sub-areas - the STACK-Meramec and the SCOOP Woodford.

STRUGGLERS

Geology has stymied hopes for a “Permian Jr”: Exploration wells pointed toward uniform rocks that produced high levels of oil, but producers instead encountered more complexity underground, and production weighted toward gas - at a time of a global glut and stubbornly low prices for the commodity.

“The SCOOP/STACK is not a traditional shale play, so when you think about developing it, there are a number of different rock types,” said Denise Yee, vice president at consultancy RS Energy Group. “As it’s so complex, the hydrocarbon mix changes across the play, and the oil window is limited.”

Another disappointment has been poorer results from subsequent wells. Perhaps more than any other U.S. shale basin, the SCOOP/STACK has suffered from a condition known as the “parent/child” well problem, where secondary wells produce less oil than the original.

These problems are reflected in a higher median breakeven price needed to cover costs in the SCOOP and STACK, according to data from consultancy Rystad Energy. Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

(Reuters) - Supercomputer manufacturer Cray Inc said on Friday it would be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co in a deal valued at about $1.30 billion, net of cash.

The $35 per share value represents a premium of 17.4% to Cray’s last close.

HPE said it expects the deal to increase its footprint in federal business and academia, and sell supercomputing products to its commercial clients.

The deal, expected to close by the first quarter of HPE’s fiscal year 2020, will add to its adjusted operating profit in the first full year after closing.

As part of the deal, HPE expects to incur one-time integration costs that will be absorbed within its fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion that remains unchanged.

Seattle-headquartered Cray has U.S.-based manufacturing operations and about 1,300 employees worldwide. It earned $456 million in revenue in its last fiscal year.

Cray’s supercomputing systems can handle massive data sets, converged modeling, simulation, artificial intelligence, and analytics workloads."

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago said they are working on a supercomputer dubbed Aurora with Intel, the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

If the project succeeds, Aurora would represent nearly an order of magnitude leap over existing machines that feature so-called petaflop performance, capable of doing 1 quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations a second.

It also heightens the stakes in a race in which the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

One of Aurora’s primary functions would be simulating nuclear blasts, a pillar of weapons development since the ban of live detonation testings.

Aurora will be built with artificial intelligence capabilities for projects such as developing better battery materials and helping the Veterans Administration prevent suicides, Rick Stevens, an associate lab director with Argonne overseeing the exascale computing project, said during a news briefing.

The project is a win for Intel, which will supply its Xeon CPU chips and Optane memory chips for Aurora.

Intel has been fending off rival U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp’s rise in the chip content of supercomputers as the machines take on more artificial intelligence work. Nvidia’s chips are found in five of the world’s current top-10 supercomputers, though the Nvidia chips are found alongside chips from its rivals, according to TOP500, which ranks the machines.

The world’s current most powerful machine, the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, contains chips from International Business Machines Corp and Nvidia.

The source of chips for supercomputers has become a factor in trade tensions between the United States and China. The world’s third-fastest supercomputer - the Sunway TaihuLight in China - has chips developed domestically in China.

Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner who studies the supercomputing market, said that despite the small contract size relative to Intel’s overall revenue, the work done on Aurora will eventually filter down to the company’s commercial customers.

“It’s not just a jingoistic race between the U.S. and China,” Dekate said. “The innovations that Intel is developing here will percolate down to other parts of its business.”"

The export restriction announcement adding the firms to what is effectively a trade blacklist is the latest effort by the Trump administration to restrict the ability of Chinese firms to gain access to U.S. technology amid an ongoing trade war.

The department said it was adding Sugon, the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology - along with numerous aliases of the five entities - to the list over concerns about military applications of the supercomputers they are developing.

Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology is owned by the 56th Research Institute of the General Staff of China’s People’s Liberation Army, the Commerce Department said, adding “its mission is to support China’s military modernization.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment.

China’s state broadcaster, China Radio International, said in an editorial on Saturday that the move was one of a series of recent actions by the United States that violated the consensus reached by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina last December.

“No matter whether it is aimed at suppressing Chinese technology or its long-term economic development, or put pressure on China in the trade negotiations, the United States will not achieve its aims,” it said.

In 2015, the Commerce Department added China’s National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) to the list “because of its use of U.S.-origin multicores, boards, and (co)processors to power supercomputers believed to support nuclear explosive simulation and military simulation activities.”

The Commerce Department said on Friday that since 2015 NUDT has procured items under the name Hunan Guofang Kei University using four separate, additional addresses not already on the entity list. The department said on Friday it is now adding Hunan Guofang and the four addresses to the list.

The companies “pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,” the Commerce Department said.

In May, the Trump administration added China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to the entity list and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that the United States could resolve complaints about Huawei as part of a trade deal.

The world’s two largest economies have ratcheted up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China’s unfair trade practices.

The United States, China, the European Union and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.

In March, a U.S. government-led group said it was working with chipmaker Intel Corp and computermaker Cray Inc to develop and build the country’s fastest computer by 2021 for conducting nuclear weapons and other research.

The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois are working on a supercomputer dubbed “Aurora with Intel,” the world’s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.

The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.

Earlier this week, Nvidia Corp, a major chip supplier to supercomputer makers, said it was working with Softbank Holdings Group owned chip firm Arm Holdings to make its chips work with Arm’s for supercomputers.

Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia’s accelerated computing unit, said that the effort was aimed at European and Japanese customers rather than Chinese groups, which are increasingly turning to domestic chips.

“In terms of China, I think they’ve clearly stated that they have a domestic accelerator and processor strategy that they will pursue, and that’s clearly what they are doing,” Buck said."

Since the start of 2017, over 20 U.S. retailers, including Sears Holdings Corp (SHLDQ.PK) and Toys ‘R’ Us, have filed for bankruptcy, succumbing to the onslaught of fierce e-commerce competition from Amazon Inc (AMZN.O).

Fred’s, which has been making losses since 2015, has been trying to turn around its business. In April, it said it would close at least 159 underperforming and unprofitable stores, or nearly 30% of its total outlets.

“Despite our team’s best efforts, we were not able to avoid this outcome,” Chief Executive Officer Joe Anto said.

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred’s said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

By Uday Sampath Kumar

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Early gains on Wall Street fizzled out by afternoon on Monday as losses in technology and healthcare stocks overshadowed increased expectations of stimulus from central banks around the world.

Microsoft Corp and Amgen Inc were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Amgen fell 3.19% after analysts raised questions about data on the company’s lung cancer drug, dragging the healthcare sector down 0.94%.

Lenders, however, were up on broad gains in U.S. Treasury yields on risings bets of an interest rate cut in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s September meeting.

Financial stocks rose 1.20%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, with banks gaining 2.62%. Technology stocks fell more than 1% and were the biggest drag on the benchmark index.

“The markets are continuing last week’s positive sentiment but with a reduction in pessimism and fear,” said Scott Brown chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Stocks gained last week on easing U.S.-China trade negotiations and global political tensions as well as increased hopes of an interest rate cut.

Cementing those expectations, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said late last week the central bank would “act as appropriate” to sustain economic expansion, a phrase that financial markets have read as a sign of an impending of rate cut.

Earlier on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not see the threat of a recession as the Trump administration seeks to revive trade negotiations with China, adding that he expected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy.

Energy stocks led gains among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors with a 1.41% rise, as oil prices got a boost from the new Saudi energy minister committing to output cuts.

At 13:11 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.95 points, or 0.08%, at 26,818.41, the S&P 500 was down 2.34 points, or 0.08%, at 2,976.37 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 22.49 points, or 0.28%, at 8,080.59.

Among other stocks, AT&T Inc gained 2.61% after shareholder Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and pushed for changes.

Boeing Co fell 0.84% after it suspended load testing of its new widebody 777X aircraft over the weekend as media reports said a cargo door failed in a ground stress test.

Since the start of 2018, that price has been $54.53 and $53.15 per barrel of oil, respectively, higher than the Permian, Bakken, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), and much of the Eagle Ford shale basins.

“The ‘Permian Jr’ nickname set some lofty expectations,” said Shak Ahmed, research analyst at RS Energy. “The play is resetting expectations around what it is capable of, and while this won’t be painless, it will be better in the long term.”

For smaller firms, and especially those backed by private equity, a lack of financial resources has limited well-design experimentation. Some are now looking to merge or sell operations.

EnCap Investments and Natural Gas Partners (NGP) are examining combining SCOOP/STACK assets, said sources familiar with the matter. Roan Resources, whose shares trade below $1.50, from more than $16 last year, in April said it was studying options after receiving inquiries about a potential sale or in-basin merger.

EnCap declined to comment. NGP did not respond to a request for comment.

February’s $5.5 billion purchase of Newfield Exploration, which had the lowest median breakeven in the STACK in 2017-18, as well as operations in North Dakota and Utah, by Encana Corp has offered hope that some deals are possible.

“The most important thing in the SCOOP/STACK isn’t scale, like it is in the Permian where the majors have huge rig counts, but having the best rock, and to be efficient in what you do,” said Timothy Perry, co-head of global oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, which advised Encana on the deal."

Del Frisco’s, which owns Eagle Steak House and Frisco’s Grille chains, said its shareholders will receive $8 per share, which represents a premium of 18.9% to Friday’s close.

Including debt, the deal is valued at $650 million. As of March 26, the company had $336.1 million in debt.

Del Frisco’s shares were up 17.4% before the bell at $7.90, slightly below Catterton’s offer price.

The restaurant chain in December said it was evaluating options for its business, including a possible sale, amid pressure from activist investor Engaged Capital, the company’s third-largest shareholder with a near 10% stake.

Engaged Capital pushed Del Frisco’s to add a board member, saying the company’s steakhouse restaurants were poorly managed and had rushed into buying two chains to avoid an acquisition.

Del Frisco’s said on Monday Engaged has agreed to vote in favor of the acquisition, which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019.

The company bought two restaurants - Barcelona and bartaco - for $325 million in cash last year, even as traffic declined in its own restaurants.

Upon closing of the deal, L Catterton said it plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona businesses separately from the steakhouse brands.

L Catterton has also invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin’ Brands Inc, Unclue Julio’s Mexican restaurants, P.F. Chang’s and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Piper Jaffray & Co was the financial adviser to Del Frisco’s, while Credit Suisse served as financial adviser to L Catterton."

If the rights are triggered, all shareholders other than any triggering person will be entitled to buy common shares at a 50 percent discount, or the company may exchange each right held by such holders for one share of common stock, Del Frisco’s said in a statement.

The rights plan will expire on Dec. 4, 2019, it said.

Engaged Capital, which owns a 9.99 percent stake in the company, on Thursday urged the restaurant operator to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale.

The activist hedge fund believes that Del Frisco’s, a steak house restaurant chain operator, is poorly managing its restaurants and rushed into buying two chains to avoid an acquisition. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported the activist investor’s push for sale.

In June, Del Frisco’s acquired Barteca Restaurant Group for $325 million in cash.

The company agreed to appoint Joe Reece to its board and also as chairman of the transaction committee that is overseeing Del Frisco’s plan to review strategic options. Reece’s appointment will increase the board size to seven members.

Shares of the company, which owns Eagle Steak House and Frisco’s Grille chains, rose nearly 4 percent to $8.25 in morning trade.

Engaged Capital, the company’s third-largest shareholder with a near 10 percent stake, has been urging for the sale saying Del Frisco’s was poorly managing its steakhouse restaurants and had rushed into buying two chains to avoid an acquisition.

In response, the company had adopted a shareholder rights plan, or a ‘poison pill’, with a 10 percent trigger in December, but said on Monday it was ending the agreement well before its scheduled expiration due to the deal with Engaged.

Reece, who also sits on the board of ecommerce company RumbleON Inc, will remain a board director until 2021, Del Frisco’s said.

Engaged Capital will now vote in favor of Del Frisco’s nominees and other proposals at any shareholder meeting, subject to certain exceptions, the company said."

"Shutterfly, Inc. | SFLY",Reuters,https://news.google.com./articles/CAIiEJS1TcFeGpA2Th-CDAk657IqFggEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMNT5lwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2019-05-13T07:00:00Z,2019-10-07-13-23,Exclusive: Amazon rolls out machines that pack orders and replace jobs,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is rolling out machines to automate a job held by thousands of its workers: boxing up customer orders.

The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years, which scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelops them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters.

Amazon has considered installing two machines at dozens more warehouses, removing at least 24 roles at each one, these people said. These facilities typically employ more than 2,000 people.

That would amount to more than 1,300 cuts across 55 U.S. fulfillment centers for standard-sized inventory. Amazon would expect to recover the costs in under two years, at $1 million per machine plus operational expenses, they said.

The plan, previously unreported, shows how Amazon is pushing to reduce labor and boost profits as automation of the most common warehouse task – picking up an item – is still beyond its reach. The changes are not finalized because vetting technology before a major deployment can take a long time.

Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.

“We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. “We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.”

(Dave Clark is Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations)

Amazon last month downplayed its automation efforts to press visiting its Baltimore fulfillment center, saying a fully robotic future was far off. Its employee base has grown to become one of the largest in the United States, as the company opened new warehouses and raised wages to attract staff in a tight labor market.

A key to its goal of a leaner workforce is attrition, one of the sources said. Rather than lay off workers, the person said, the world’s largest online retailer will one day refrain from refilling packing roles. Those have high turnover because boxing multiple orders per minute over 10 hours is taxing work. At the same time, employees that stay with the company can be trained to take up more technical roles.

The new machines, known as the CartonWrap from Italian firm CMC Srl, pack much faster than humans. They crank out 600 to 700 boxes per hour, or four to five times the rate of a human packer, the sources said. The machines require one person to load customer orders, another to stock cardboard and glue and a technician to fix jams on occasion.

CMC declined to comment.

Though Amazon has announced it intends to speed up shipping across its Prime loyalty program, this latest round of automation is not focused on speed. “It’s truly about efficiency and savings,” one of the people said.

Including other machines known as the “SmartPac,” which the company rolled out recently to mail items in patented envelopes, Amazon’s technology suite will be able to automate a majority of its human packers. Five rows of workers at a facility can turn into two, supplemented by two CMC machines and one SmartPac, the person said.

The company describes this as an effort to “re-purpose” workers, the person said.

It could not be learned where roles might disappear first and what incentives, if any, are tied to those specific jobs.

But the hiring deals that Amazon has with governments are often generous. For the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last year in Alabama, for instance, the state promised the company $48.7 million over 10 years, its department of commerce said.

PICKING CHALLENGE

Amazon is not alone in testing CMC’s packing technology. JD.com Inc and Shutterfly Inc have used the machines as well, the companies said, as has Walmart Inc, according to a person familiar with its pilot.

Walmart started 3.5 years ago and has since installed the machines in several U.S. locations, the person said. The company declined to comment.

Interest in boxing technology sheds light on how the e-commerce behemoths are approaching one of the major problems in the logistics industry today: finding a robotic hand that can grasp diverse items without breaking them.

Amazon employs countless workers at each fulfillment center who do variations of this same task. Some stow inventory, while others pick customer orders and still others grab those orders, placing them in the right size box and taping them up.

Many venture-backed companies and university researchers are racing to automate this work. While advances in artificial intelligence are improving machines’ accuracy, there is still no guarantee that robotic hands can prevent a marmalade jar from slipping and breaking, or switch seamlessly from picking up an eraser to grabbing a vacuum cleaner.

Amazon has tested different vendors’ technology that it may one day use for picking, including from Soft Robotics, a Boston-area startup that drew inspiration from octopus tentacles to make grippers more versatile, one person familiar with Amazon’s experimentation said. Soft Robotics declined to comment on its work with Amazon but said it has handled a wide and ever-changing variety of products for multiple large retailers.

Believing that grasping technology is not ready for prime time, Amazon is automating around that problem when packing customer orders. Humans still place items on a conveyor, but machines then build boxes around them and take care of the sealing and labeling. This saves money not just by reducing labor but by reducing wasted packing materials as well.

These machines are not without flaws. CMC can only produce so many per year. They need a technician on site who can fix problems as they arise, a requirement Amazon would rather do without, the two sources said. The super-hot glue closing the boxes can pile up and halt a machine.

Still other types of automation, like the robotic grocery assembly system of Ocado Group PLC, are the focus of much industry interest.

But the boxing machines are already proving helpful to Amazon. The company has installed them in busy warehouses that are driving distance from Seattle, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Manchester and elsewhere, the people said.

The machines have the potential to automate far more than 24 jobs per facility, one of the sources said. The company is also setting up nearly two dozen more U.S. fulfillment centers for small and non-specialty inventory, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which could be ripe for the machines.

This is just a harbinger of automation to come.

“A ‘lights out’ warehouse is ultimately the goal,” one of the people said."
