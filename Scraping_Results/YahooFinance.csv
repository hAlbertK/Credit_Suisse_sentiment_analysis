The roundtable was open to all Florida electric utilities - municipal, cooperative and investor-owned and to Sustainability Program Managers, Conservation and Efficiency Managers, Regulatory and Compliance Personnel, Renewables Coordinators, Electrical Engineers, Utility Directors and Managers, Policymakers and EV Coordinators.

Florida's 33 municipal electric utilities, combined, are the third largest electric provider in the state. Florida's public power utilities serve more than 1.4 million customer accounts and are a statewide employment leader with 5,400+ employees.

ADOMANI’s CFO Mike Menerey said: “We are disappointed by the fact that our recently disclosed strong second quarter results and backlog, plus our expanding product line, were not enough to promote the buying interest necessary to offset the impact of short sellers, and ultimately caused us to be unable to comply with NASDAQ’s minimum $1.00/share requirement to maintain our NASDAQ listing. Trading on OTCQB will enable us to maintain liquidity for our current and future stockholders.” Menerey continued: “We will endeavor to continue to execute our business plan and provide positive results for our stockholders. We do not anticipate any impact to our business or operations as a result of the move to OTCQB, and we reiterate our guidance for 2019 that we remain confident that we will convert the majority of our June 30, 2019 backlog to sales revenue in 2019, putting us in position to meet analyst consensus revenue estimates for the year.”

ADOMANI’s application for trading on the OTCQB® Venture Market has been accepted by the OTC Markets Group, and its common stock will be traded on the OTCQB Market under its current trading symbol “ADOM”.

Second Quarter 2019 Revenue of $7.3 Million, Up 18% Quarter-Over-Quarter



First Half 2019 Revenue of $13.6 Million, Up 40% Year-Over-Year

Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AESE) (or the “Company”), today provided financial results for the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2019 as well as an update on several key business initiatives. As previously announced, the Company was formed on August 9, 2019 as a result of the completion of a business combination among Black Ridge Acquisition Corp., Allied Esports International, Inc., WPT Enterprises, Inc. and other affiliates.

“In the second quarter and through the first half of 2019, we successfully executed on our business plan and are excited about how both Allied Esports and WPT are performing,” said Frank Ng, CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “We are confident in our long-term strategy and look forward to continuing to drive growth and maximize shareholder value.”

Capital Structure and Liquidity

The business combination generated $20.8 million in gross proceeds for the Company. The table below outlines total cash following transaction-related expenses and payments.

(USD, millions) Cash on Balance Sheet1 $ 7.0 Proceeds From Business Combination 20.8 Transaction Expenses and Cash Considerations2 (6.1 ) Total Cash3 $ 21.7

1 Cash on Balance Sheet of Allied and WPT as of June 30, 2019 2 Includes all cash transaction costs and cash paid at closing 3 Pro forma for business combination as of June 30, 2019. Includes restricted cash specifically allocated for strategic initiatives

After close of the business combination, the Company’s basic and diluted common shares outstanding totaled 23.1 million shares.

Allied and WPT Financial Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

Revenues: Total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased 17.7% to $7.3 million from $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a $0.3 million increase in In-person revenues primarily generated from the Company’s flagship Esports Arena Las Vegas and gaming truck events, as well as a $0.8 million increase in Multiplatform revenues related to the distribution of WPT content. Total second quarter 2019 revenues derived from WPT grew 5% to $5.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019 while revenues from Allied Esports grew 60% to $2.3 million over the previous quarter. The Allied Esports growth was driven by an increase in revenues generated at the Company’s flagship HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, which opened in March 2018, as well as increased revenue from the company’s gaming truck events.

Revenue (in thousands) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, March 31, Percentage June 30, June 30, Percentage 2019 2019 Change 2019 2018 Change Revenues: Multiplatform $ 1,657 $ 852 94.5 % $ 2,509 $ 1,172 114.1 % Interactive 2,378 2,386 -0.3 % 4,764 4,681 1.8 % In-person 3,303 2,997 10.2 % 6,300 3,866 63.0 % Total revenues $ 7,338 $ 6,235 17.7 % $ 13,573 $ 9,719 39.7 %

Costs and expenses: Total costs and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $10.1 million, consistent with the previous quarter. Increases of $1.0 million in multiplatform costs due primarily to increased productions costs and commissions were largely offset by reductions in Interactive expenses and the lack of any additional impairment related to the company’s reduced ownership of Esports Arena Orange County and Esports Arena Oakland.

Operational Update

Strategic Alliances: As previously announced, Simon, a global leader in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, and TV Azteca, a premier sports television network in Mexico, have made equity investments into Allied Esports Entertainment and are launching strategic alliances with the Company.

Simon and Allied Esports will collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the U.S. The in-mall venues will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events. The two companies plan to announce additional details for The Simon Cup, a co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival this fall combining online and in-person play at select mall locations in the New York and Los Angeles markets, with the winners of the regionals moving on to HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas for the final.

TV Azteca and Allied Esports will continue to work together to expand the esports landscape in Mexico through a number of immediate initiatives, including creating a 24-hour digital esports channel dedicated to esports and video gaming for the Mexican market and developing a network of esports talent across Mexico and Latin America. Future considerations also include building a flagship esports venue and additional esports and content facilities in Mexico and developing a localized online esports tournament platform for the market.

(NASDAQ:AESE)?,"A look at the shareholders of Allied Esports Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:AESE) can tell us which group is most powerful. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.'

With a market capitalization of US$96m, Allied Esports Entertainment is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions don't own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about AESE.

NasdaqCM:AESE Ownership Summary, August 22nd 2019 More

What Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Allied Esports Entertainment?

We don't tend to see institutional investors holding stock of companies that are very risky, thinly traded, or very small. Though we do sometimes see large companies without institutions on the register, it's not particularly common.

There are multiple explanations for why institutions don't own a stock. The most common is that the company is too small relative to fund under management, so the institition does not bother to look closely at the company. It is also possible that fund managers don't own the stock because they aren't convinced it will perform well. Allied Esports Entertainment might not have the sort of past performance institutions are looking for, or perhaps they simply have not studied the business closely.

NasdaqCM:AESE Income Statement, August 22nd 2019 More

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Allied Esports Entertainment. As far I can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.

Insider Ownership Of Allied Esports Entertainment

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Leading Destination Operator to Purchase $5 Million of Shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. and Collaborate with Allied Esports to Build Esports Venues at Simon Properties

“Simon Cup” Tournaments and Activations with HyperX Esports Truck to Launch at Select Simon Locations This Fall

Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (BRAC), a public acquisition vehicle, today announced that it has entered into a letter agreement for Simon Equity Development, LLC, a wholly-owned and indirect subsidiary of Simon Property Group (SPG), to become a shareholder of Allied Esports, a global esports entertainment company, through an equity investment in Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.

As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame International Holdings Limited, will be acquired, once all applicable shareholder and regulatory consents have been obtained, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. to form Allied Esports Entertainment (the “Business Combination”).

Highlights from the letter agreement include:

Simon acquiring $5 million in shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.;

Simon and Allied Esports creating dedicated esports venues and experiences at select Simon locations throughout the United States; and

Simon and Allied Esports launching a new competition tour called The Simon Cup.

The obligations of the parties to move forward with the transactions contemplated by the letter agreement are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including but not limited to the execution of definitive agreements between the parties documenting the obligations of Simon to purchase the shares of Black Ridge and consummation of the Business Combination.

Simon and Allied Esports will also collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the country. The in-mall arenas will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events.

“We're extremely pleased to collaborate with Black Ridge and Allied Esports, leading innovators in esports and gaming, to bring cutting-edge venues to our iconic properties around the country. This is exactly the type of innovative activation that excites our customers and drives traffic for our centers at Simon. Simon's successful locations are ideally suited to provide these new and exciting community spaces, complementing our other dynamic offerings,” said Mark Silvestri, Simon's Chief Operating Officer for Development.

“The agreement with Simon is a landmark opportunity to bring Allied Esports’ vision for the future of competitive gaming to Simon's world class property network,” said Lyle Berman, Director of Black Ridge. “As we work to close the transaction combining our NASDAQ-listed Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. with Allied Esports and WPT, the significant investment by Simon would be a testament to our unrivaled plans and to the opportunity Simon sees to participate in this growing industry.”

In addition, Allied Esports and Simon will this year launch The Simon Cup, a groundbreaking, co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival combining online and in-person elements into a uniquely integrated content format. The activation includes regional tournament events at select Simon centers in the New York and Los Angeles markets, culminating in a Grand Final at the iconic HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“Simon’s commitment and investment in our growing esports ecosystem will immediately strengthen our foundation for creating live experiences and compelling content for gamers and fans around the world,” said Frank Ng, co-CEO of Ourgame, owner of Allied Esports. “We are thrilled for the opportunity to work closely with the forward-thinking team at Simon to design specialized mall-based esports concepts that we hope will attract new audiences and partners through their network and enhance our global presence.”

Purchase Details

Assuming the parties execute a definitive agreement for the transaction, Simon would purchase $5 million of newly issued shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. at a price equal to the price at which Black Ridge shareholders can have their shares converted for a pro rata portion of the Black Ridge trust account upon closing of the Business Combination; however, the dollar amount of newly issued shares will be reduced by the dollar amount Simon spends, at its sole option, purchasing shares of common stock of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Simon has agreed not to seek conversion of any shares it purchases pursuant to this investment at the meeting called to approve the Business Combination. In consideration of the purchase commitment, Black Ridge would issue to Simon on closing of the Business Combination one additional share of Black Ridge common stock for every ten (10) shares that are purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment and a warrant to purchase one (1) share of Black Ridge common stock for every two (2) shares purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment. For additional information on the transaction, see Black Ridge’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed promptly and which can be obtained, without charge, on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website (http://www.sec.gov).

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. Given the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and the Company’s pending Chapter 11 cases, the Company does not plan to appeal the Nasdaq determination to delist the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, trading of the Company’s common stock and warrants will be suspended at the opening of business on September 24, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company expects the common stock and warrants to be traded over-the-counter under the symbol “AMRQ” and “AMRWWQ” and expects to continue filing its annual, quarterly and current reports in accordance with the requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

SEATTLE, Aug. 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced an entirely new, open and extensible software platform to address the growing need for supercomputing across government and private industries. As advanced simulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation create new, data intensive workloads, the need for performance at scale is growing rapidly. Recognizing the challenges presented by the exascale era, Cray’s software fuses supercomputing performance and capability with the modularity, composability and ease-of-use of cloud computing. In a separate press release issued today, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) announced that Cray has been awarded a third U.S. exascale system contract. The system, dubbed “El Capitan,” will be sited at LLNL. Cray now has $1.5 billion in business for Shasta™ supercomputing systems and the new software platform.



“The Shasta software used with the El Capitan system expands traditional supercomputing to support the complex workflows and numerous 3D studies necessary to unlock the full potential of exascale computing,” said Bill Goldstein, lab director at LLNL. “The flexibility and extensibility of El Capitan’s software and hardware environment will enable the NNSA laboratories to explore and develop capabilities that leverage the combination of AI and machine learning with modeling and simulation to accelerate time-to-solution for our national security codes. These technologies could apply equally well to multi-physics codes employed outside of the national security domain.”

Cray has a rich history of developing the most performant, scalable and reliable software in supercomputing. This is validated by the vast majority of global weather centers that rely on Cray to deliver time critical numerical weather forecasts. These weather centers are at the forefront of the convergence of HPC, AI and IoT workloads that operate at immense scale.

Cray’s new software platform improves performance and reliability by including new key capabilities:

Extends traditional HPC batch workflow scheduling for modeling and simulation with new Kubernetes container orchestration to enable converged HPC and AI workflows.

Adds support for multi-tenancy between HPC and AI partitions and sub-partitioning within AI jobs to enable workflow isolation.

Provides highly resilient containerized services with separate compute and management planes to minimize planned and unplanned downtime.

Creates an open supercomputing platform by including standardized and supported APIs for integration, data access and software ecosystem extensibility and interoperability.

Delivers a new and fully integrated telemetry for the system as well as user application level monitoring to quickly correlate and remediate issues.

“As we enter the exascale era, modern applications are creating the need for applying supercomputing capability to a new class of digital transformation problems. What is the domain of a few national laboratories today is fast becoming a necessity for every enterprise,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO, Cray, Inc. “With our new software platform, Cray is delivering a fully featured, extensible software and tools environment that performs like a supercomputer and runs like a cloud. The same Cray technology that powers exascale systems can be delivered in a single, low-cost rack and ready to integrate into any data center environment.”

With this next generation supercomputing software platform, Cray has addressed key requirements:

Application development and portability : Developers can easily compose converged modeling, simulation, analytics and AI workflows using modern microservices and a robust suite of tools and compilers that support a broad spectrum of processors and accelerators. Applications can easily move from laptop to supercomputer for maximum scalability of code with minimal refactoring.

Management and monitoring : IT administrators employ a unified systems management and telemetry framework to ensure production reliability for job execution and support high system availability.

: IT administrators employ a unified systems management and telemetry framework to ensure production reliability for job execution and support high system availability. Interoperability: IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols.

IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols. Investment protection: CXOs and business owners benefit from a multi-user and multipurpose platform with support for heterogeneous processor architectures (x86, AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, FPGAs and other accelerators) and the scalability to meet their rapidly growing analytics and AI initiatives.

“Shasta is designed to support extremely heterogeneous workloads not just from science and engineering, but also from the growing contingent of enterprises that acquire supercomputers to outcompete their rivals in the new era of digital transformation and AI,” said Steve Conway, COO and senior vice president of research at Hyperion Research. “Cray Shasta supercomputers aim to move leading enterprises beyond proof-of-concept to production, and to operate on premises or in the cloud. By integrating extremely heterogeneous requirements into the new Shasta system hardware and software, Cray has substantially expanded its addressable market to include enterprise analytics, AI and cloud computing.”

Cray’s new software platform will be available starting Q4 of 2019. For more information, please contact your authorized Cray sales representative or www.cray.com .

“The Department of Energy is the world leader in supercomputing and El Capitan is a critical addition to our next generation systems,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. “El Capitan’s advanced capabilities for modeling, simulation and artificial intelligence will help push America’s competitive edge in energy and national security, allow us to ask tougher questions, solve greater challenges and develop better solutions for generations to come.”

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

(CRAY) ?,"How do we determine whether Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) makes for a good investment at the moment? We analyze the sentiment of a select group of the very best investors in the world, who spend immense amounts of time and resources studying companies. They may not always be right (no one is), but data shows that their consensus long positions have historically outperformed the market when we adjust for known risk factors.

Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) shareholders have witnessed an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. Our calculations also showed that CRAY isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in our short portfolio.

Warren Buffett said that he likes 'a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people'. So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

Diversicare Healthcare Services is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$17m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about DVCR.

NasdaqCM:DVCR Ownership Summary, June 19th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Diversicare Healthcare Services?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

Diversicare Healthcare Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 26% of the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Diversicare Healthcare Services's historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

NasdaqCM:DVCR Income Statement, June 19th 2019 More

Our data indicates that hedge funds own 6.8% of Diversicare Healthcare Services. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Our information suggests that there isn't any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

TORRANCE, Calif., Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reiterated the improved balance sheet, reduced debt service and other benefits realized from its recently completed merger transaction announced on July 17, 2019.

The company also said it will report results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 next week.

In conjunction with and prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI Holding, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc.) were converted into shares of EMI common stock thereby increasing stockholders' equity by the corresponding amount. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock.

The pro forma combined balance sheets as of March 31, 2019, after giving effect to the conversion, as well as the final terms of the merger agreement and additional information about Emmaus, can be found in the company's July 22, 2019 Form 8-K filing which can be accessed on the Emmaus investor relations website at ir.emmausmedical.com.

Additionally, Emmaus has officially requested a hearing to appeal the previously announced determination of the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to delist the company's common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing, which is scheduled for September 5, 2019. In the event the appeal is unsuccessful, Emmaus common stock is expected to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Market.

""Our recent merger was a great step toward solidifying our balance sheet and providing us with greater access to the capital markets, which can help fund Emmaus' growth strategy as well as potential future acquisitions or other strategic transactions,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We strongly believe that Emmaus is on the right trajectory to achieve its mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies. The merger was one of the catalysts for Emmaus' improved financial position, putting us in a great place to move the company forward.""

SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

SB360 Capital Partners, LLC. A Schottenstein Affiliate (PRNewsfoto/SB360 Capital Partners) More

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Fred's Inc said on Monday it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, months after the pharmacy and discount retailer began shuttering hundreds of unprofitable stores in the United States, sending its shares down 44% before the bell.

Since the start of 2017, over 20 U.S. retailers, including Sears Holdings Corp and Toys 'R' Us, have filed for bankruptcy, succumbing to the onslaught of fierce e-commerce competition from Amazon Inc.

Fred's, which has been making losses since 2015, has been trying to turn around its business. In April, it said it would close at least 159 underperforming and unprofitable stores, or nearly 30% of its total outlets.

""Despite our team's best efforts, we were not able to avoid this outcome,"" Chief Executive Officer Joe Anto said.

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred's said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

Shares of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company, which have lost nearly all their value since the company was forced to scrap its bid for 1,200 Rite Aid Corp stores in June 2017, plunged to 15 cents in early trading.

On October 27, 2015, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens jointly announced an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9.00 per share in cash. To convince the investing public that it would receive FTC approval to complete the merger, Walgreens and Rite Aid had entered into an agreement with Fred's to sell 865 Rite Aid Corp stores for $950 million in an all-cash transaction in order to complete the Original Merger (the ""Fred's Asset Purchase Agreement""). On January 30, 2017, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens announced that they had entered into a new merger agreement (the ""Revised Merger""). On June 29, 2017, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc announced that they had terminated the Revised Merger. Following the termination of the Revised Merger, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc terminated the Fred's Asset Purchase Agreement.

(HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date.

The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

Relatives of the late Raymond Sackler hold a 54% stake in Peak Resorts Inc., which operates 17 ski areas including New York’s Hunter Mountain and Mount Snow in Vermont. Vail Resorts Inc. completed its acquisition of Peak on Tuesday, two months after the deal was announced.

The Sacklers own stock and warrants through Delaware-based Cap 1 LLC, which has held a stake since at least 2015, according to regulatory filings. Beneficiaries of the trust that owns Cap 1 include Raymond’s widow Beverly, son Richard and grandson David. They’re among the eight family members accused in state lawsuits of contributing to the nationwide public-health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans from overdoses.

It’s unclear how much profit the Sacklers reaped from the ski resort deal, because some stock purchases may not have been publicly disclosed. Vail is paying $11 a share for Peak Resorts, a 116% premium over its July 22 closing price. That would value the Sackler stake at $114 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg.

Davidson Goldin, a spokesman for portions of the Sackler family, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Purdue Bankruptcy

Heirs of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler gained notoriety over the past several years as the opioid crisis worsened. Their wealth is founded on drug company Purdue Pharma Inc., maker of the painkiller OxyContin.

Purdue filed for bankruptcy this month to settle claims that it pushed sales of the addictive drug. The Chapter 11 filing is designed to short-circuit more than 2,000 lawsuits against Purdue and the Sackler family by the states, cities and counties that have sued to recoup billion of dollars they spent battling opioid addictions and overdoses. Under a settlement proposal, the governments, hospitals and individuals suing Purdue would take ownership from the Sacklers, who have also agreed to pay at least $3 billion and to sell other assets. Such a deal would be expected to raise a total of more than $10 billion.

Opponents argue Purdue’s plan isn’t enough of a reckoning for the Sacklers, who made billions from the over-prescribing of OxyContin by doctors, spurred by the company’s marketing. The family got more than $4 billion from OxyContin sales from 2008 through 2015, court filings show.

The lawsuits describe a web of trusts, holding entities and investment vehicles comprising the Sackler fortune, including Summer Road LLC, a family office run by David A. Sackler that provides investment-management services to Cap 1.

Summer Road has also invested in hedge fund strategies and bought an office building in West Palm Beach, Florida, for $6.8 million, the Palm Beach Post reported last week. It also owned 8% of eye-care product developer Ocular Therapeutix Inc. and about 7% of Correvio Pharma Corp. as of June 30, according to its latest 13-F filing.

Purdue made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin and is widely blamed for fueling a nationwide crisis that has left more than 400,000 people dead from abuse of prescription opioids over the past two decades.

According to the filings obtained by the Post, members of the family are benefitting from the sale of 17 resorts in the Northeast and Midwest. The Sacklers, known for a complex network of business interests, had a stake in the company Peak Resorts Inc., which owned the ski areas, according to the Post.

Some of the winter resorts lie within the Catskills of New York and the vast hills of New Hampshire, Vermont and Pennsylvania -- places known to have battled the wave of opioid addiction.

Peak Resorts Inc. declined to comment on the matter.

The sale, finalized last week, comes just after Purdue filed for bankruptcy in New York following a tentative settlement with many state and local governments suing it over the toll of opioids.

Representatives for Purdue Pharma didn't mmediately respond to request for comment from FOX Business.

The plan calls for turning Purdue into a “public benefit trust” that would continue selling preecription opioids but use its profits for lawsuit settlements. The Sackler family would give up control of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.

The ""framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,” Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue’s board of directors, said in a statement, “and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis.”

Two dozen states have signed on to the settlement plan along with lawyers who represent many of the 2,000-plus local governments suing the company.

But legal battles still lie ahead for Purdue, which did not admit to any wrongdoing. Several states plan to object to the settlement in bankruptcy court and to continue litigation in other courts against members of the Sackler family. They argue the family has funneled a fortune from the firm into shell companies and Swiss bank accounts, and is getting off too easily

A court filing by the New York Attorney General's Office earlier this month contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves.

The Sacklers are simply ""throwing the carcass of this drug company into bankruptcy,” said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, whose state plans to join Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York in pursuing the company.

Since OxyContin was introduced in 1996, addiction and overdoses have surged. In both 2017 and 2018, opioids were involved in more than 47,000 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While Wall Street groaned over the struggles of Uber Technologies, Inc., Lyft, Inc., and WeWork parent The We Company in recent months, a cousin of the traditional IPO has flourished, often delivering a healthy exit for private owners and strong aftermarket trading for public shareholders. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are on course to break records in 2019 both in terms of fundraising and target companies acquired. The structure, which allows a sponsor to raise cash in a new listed vehicle and bring a private company public through M&A, has been around since the 1990s but evolved dramatically since. What have been the key features behind successful deals? What elements of the structure are likely to change? And are there limits on the size and variety of deals going forward?

These were some of the questions addressed at SPAC in Action!, IPO Edge’s first SPAC-focused roundtable featuring four leading experts who are all active players in the field. The participants included Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP; Phil Denning, Partner at communications and advisory firm ICR Inc.; Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds; and Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II.

Mr. Smith, who has advised clients on notable deals including WillScot Corporation and Limbach Holdings, stressed that successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. He also believes that the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets and that SPACs that are too large can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. He ultimately believes that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges.

As an institutional investor in recent deals such as at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited and payments company Repay Holdings Corporation, Mr. Greenberg noted that SPACs offer distinct advantages over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg said he was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Mr. Heyer brings perspective as both the CEO of two recent SPACs and a veteran business executive with decades of experience. He believes that SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. Mr. Heyer’s latest deal was to bring OneSpaWorld public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target.

Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group, said that SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs.

The complete interviews with each of the four roundtable participants can be found below.





Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP

Successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. Often the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets. And while some SPAC IPOs have approached a billion dollars, huge SPACs can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. That’s according to Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP, which has advised clients in SPAC transactions including New Frontier Corporation, Netfin Acquisition Corp., WillScot Corporation, Target Hospitality, and Limbach Holdings. Mr. Smith also says that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges. The full interview is below.

Elliott M. Smith focuses his practice on corporate and securities law. Elliott advises clients on a wide variety of capital markets transactional matters, including IPOs, follow-on offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities. Elliott has particular experience representing SPACs and their sponsor teams in IPOs and back-end business combinations. Elliott also advises public company clients on corporate governance matters and compliance with the federal securities laws.

IPO Edge: How has the warrant feature on SPACs evolved and where do you see it going?

Mr. Smith: Way back in the 1990s, SPACs issued units consisting of one share and two warrants, one of which was struck in-the-money, meaning the strike price was below the per-unit IPO price. The in-the-money warrant functioned like an immediate capital raise following the closing of a business combination, but created a lot of dilution to stockholders which put pressure on the stock price. In the 2000s, SPAC IPO units evolved to typically include one in-the-money warrant. Towards the end of that cycle, around 2008, SPACs starting issuing units with one share and one warrant which was struck out-of-the-money.

These days, SPACs issue units in their IPO for $10.00, and the units include a share and a warrant (or a fraction of warrant). The warrants have an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Some repeat sponsor teams or sponsors affiliated with well-known private equity funds are able to leverage their deal-making track record in order to reduce the number of warrants issued as part of the units to one-half or even one-third of a warrant. By reducing the warrant coverage (i.e., the number of shares issuable upon exercise of all the warrants), these sponsors can market their SPACs as more attractive vehicles to target companies and investors as compared to other SPACs that have more warrants outstanding, since the former represent less potential dilution to stockholders upon completion of the business combination.

The warrants are a necessary sweetener in order to bring investors into a SPAC’s IPO, but can be unattractive to potential investors in the stock later on after a business combination because of the overhang. Over the years SPACs have tried to mitigate this by eliminating or ‘cleaning up’ the warrants at the time of the business combination or shortly thereafter, usually through amendments to the warrant agreement that effectively convert the warrants into cash and/or shares. In terms of the future, warrants will likely always be part of a SPAC’s IPO units in one form or another, and I don’t see SPAC units including less than one-third of a warrant anytime soon.

IPO Edge: How do you convince investors to take fewer warrants with their IPO shares?

Mr. Smith: It’s really a function of investors’ regard for the quality of the sponsor team and their track record and the investors’ perception of their ability to find a good target business and complete a business combination. Top-tier sponsor teams that generate a lot of investor interest in their IPOs can offer less favorable terms (i.e., less warrants). First-time sponsor teams rarely can get away with including less than a full warrant in their SPAC units. And when the market slows down, even repeat sponsors will sweeten their IPOs with additional warrant coverage in order to get the IPO sold.

IPO Edge: What are the key ingredients in getting a SPAC IPO to work?

Mr. Smith: Frankly, in recent years we’ve seen a lot of first-time sponsor teams able to complete IPOs, which makes it look like it’s not too difficult to raise a SPAC if the sponsors are willing to provide favorable terms to IPO investors, such as overfunding the trust account or providing significant warrant coverage.

That said, we have seen some IPOs downsize or get pulled due to investor skepticism of teams that come in to SPACs who have not been involved in public deals or growth equity transactions before, like distressed asset investors, or even successful executives who want to do a SPAC because they like the look of the potential returns but don’t have much of a track record for deal making. The SPAC product is really best suited to growth equity stories where the right combination of a savvy sponsor and a solid target business generate investor interest. Distressed assets and value transactions have generally not fared so well with SPACs.

IPO Edge: Some SPACs have recently raised several hundred million dollars in their IPOs. Can they keep growing? What are the remaining issues?

Mr. Smith: In the past few years the size of SPAC IPOs has increased, in some instances to nearly a billion dollars. But oddly enough there are challenges with big SPACs. Generally, in order to mitigate the dilution from the founder shares and warrants, a target business should be 3-4x the value of the SPAC’s trust account. Finding a target business with valuation of $2+ billion can be challenging for SPACs. Companies that size often don’t need some of the things a SPAC offers and can just go do a traditional IPO if desired. So the pool of target companies can be smaller for big SPACs and we’ve had some sponsor teams ask whether it’s possible to reduce a SPAC’s size after the IPO, which is not really possible. As a result, depending on the industry in which a SPAC is focused, we see repeat sponsors opting to raise SPACs in the $200-$400 million range for maximum flexibility to look for a target 3-4x its size, or sometimes larger. If needed, SPACs can scale up for larger deals by raising additional capital at the time of the business combination.

IPO Edge: What kind of advantages do combinations with SPACs have over traditional IPOs?

Mr. Smith: It can be faster, easier, and often cheaper to go public through a SPAC than a traditional IPO. The traditional IPO process typically takes 9-18 months. A SPAC business combination can get done in four months.

With SPACs, there’s greater flexibility regarding deal structuring, marketing materials and communications with investors. Target sellers can take more cash off the table than is otherwise possible in a traditional IPO. SPAC marketing materials can include projections, which is rare for IPOs. There is also flexibility on timing. In an IPO, if the market is not there, the deal often will need to be pulled and the company is back to square one. With SPACs, the transaction terms can be re-cut to be more favorable to investors, additional capital can be brought in through a PIPE or debt financing if needed, and these changes can be made in real time during the marketing process right up until the closing. In an IPO, those kinds of changes would need to be pushed through a Form S-1 and would likely delay the SEC review process, so that’s another advantage for SPACs.

One potential downside of all that flexibility with SPACs is that sponsors and targets can get deals done even if the transaction is not well received by the market. That can lead to real challenges for the post-closing company. If too many public investors redeem at the time of the business combination, the stock will be thinly traded which can make it hard to raise additional capital. It can be challenging for post-SPAC companies to attract institutions to invest in the secondary market if there is low trading volume in the company’s stock.

Another thing to remember is that with a traditional IPO, the Company is typically selling a minority stake in the company to the public, so the potential to be oversubscribed can be higher. In a traditional IPO, the offering size can be calibrated to investor demand and the underwriters can ensure there is healthy aftermarket trading in the stock. With a SPAC, particularly the large ones, sponsors have to turn over all the outstanding stock of the SPAC, which can soak up all the demand in the market make for choppy trading following the closing.

IPO Edge: What about limitations on SPACs and can they be improved?

Mr. Smith: The product itself is inherently flexible to accommodate all types of transactions. It’s really about the sponsor team and the kind of target business that they bring to the market. If a SPAC doesn’t bring a good target business to its shareholders, then it doesn’t matter what the warrant coverage is or if the founders are giving up some of their founder shares, public stockholders will redeem their shares and the stock price is going to suffer. On the other hand, we’ve seen SPACs that have a full warrant do a deal that is well received and they are able to withstand the overhang issue and create value for investors post-closing. So it’s really a function of the quality of the transaction, as well as the target management team’s ability to execute on its growth plan.

That said, there are headwinds for SPACs. One is perception. People continue to view SPACs as high risk. Unfortunately, there are several examples of deals that have gone south after closing, or people remember 2008 when several SPACs liquidated with no deal. Unfortunately, with each business combination that gets done and the stock price tanks, it’s a ding on the SPAC product, which isn’t really right but it’s about the perception.

Some think that SPACs have a tendency to overpay when time is running out for them and they need to find a deal. There’s probably some truth to that, but again, if a sponsor team and target company’s sellers understand the product and the process and are focused on positioning the company to perform post-closing, then I think those negative factors can be overcome.

Lastly, we’ve heard some sponsors lament that their banks don’t ‘show up’ for them to market the business combination with the same energy compared to a traditional IPO. That may be because of how the deferred underwriting fee gets allocated within the bank, and so there probably is room for improvement there that would help back-end deals get executed successfully.





Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds

SPACs can offer distinct advantages to institutional investors over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. That’s according to Cliff Greenberg, SVP and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds, which has invested in a number of recent SPAC companies including at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld (ticker: OSW) and payments company Repay Holdings (ticker: RPAY). Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Cliff Greenberg is the Portfolio Manager of Baron Small Cap Fund. He invests in small-sized U.S. companies with significant growth potential. Investments include fallen angels with strong long-term franchises that have disappointed investors, and special situations where lack of investor awareness creates opportunities. Mr. Greenberg has 35 years of investing experience, including 22 years at Baron Funds.

IPO Edge: Your fund was instrumental in the process of Repay going public through a SPAC, with Baron Funds participating in a private placement that helped extinguish 75% of the warrants in the deal. How did you view that situation?

Mr. Greenberg: Repay had enough money to close the deal, but we advised them to take a little more to immediately buy the warrants. The warrants were dilutive and added confusion to the capital structure. We also preferred that they run with a little less leverage and have more capital to pursue accretive acquisitions.

IPO Edge: SPACs have been raising larger and larger amounts of money. What’s your view on investing in a SPAC at the time of IPO?

Mr. Greenberg: I don’t like to invest in blind pools. I invest in companies, so my approach is to wait until the SPAC identifies a target and then decide.

Sometimes, I’ll put more money in if they need it like I did with Repay. In other cases, I’ll just go out and buy SPAC shares in the market as we did with Clarivate.

IPO Edge: What do you like about SPACs compared with IPOs?

Mr. Greenberg: I can get size with a SPAC. In a regular IPO, I may get $5 million or $10 million in the allocation. But then the stock may jump, and I won’t want to buy any more since it’s too expensive. You’re often not able to establish a full position at a reasonable price.

A big advantage with a SPAC is that I can invest more capital upfront at what I believe is a reasonable price.

Another advantage is there is more disclosure and more time to do due diligence. You can learn more about a SPAC’s acquisition target, see projections, and communicate with management. I take advantage of the ability to meet these companies and get to know them well before investing.

IPO Edge: What’s contributed to the success of SPACs over time?

Mr. Greenberg: There has been an evolution. These used to be $20, $50, $100 million raises. They were acquiring flaky companies and there was a big risk that the deal wouldn’t get approved. Also excess compensation was going to sponsors who didn’t play a role in the acquired companies.

Now, you have $300, $400, $500 million raised. The sponsors are playing a very significant role in the future of the company and are more reasonably compensated for their role.

IPO Edge: Getting back to the Repay deal, what role do you think warrants will play going forward?

Mr. Greenberg: Warrants complicate financial structures and are dilutive. There used to be two warrants issued per share, then one. You’ve had deals done with less than one warrant and there are some in the market now with a quarter of a warrant, which is a favorable development for new long-term investors.

Investors aren’t demanding as many goodies upfront as they were in the past. Institutional buyers don’t need as much incentive.

It’s a positive that Repay was able to retire a good portion of the warrants that were issued upon approval of the deal. I believe this will be emulated going forward and is a major positive.

Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II

SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. That’s according to Steven Heyer, a veteran business executive who brought OneSpaWorld Holdings (ticker: OSW) public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean, has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target. The full interview is below.

Steven Heyer is Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II. He is also lead director of OneSpaWorld Holdings and serves as a director of Lazard Ltd and Lazard Group. Mr. Heyer has over 40 years of experience in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries leading a range of companies and brands. He has applied his leadership and analytical skills in a variety of leadership positions across diverse industry groups, including broadcast media, consumer products, along with hotel and leisure companies. Mr. Heyer was the Chief Executive Officer of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and President and Chief Operating Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. He also was President and Chief Operating Officer of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., and a member of AOL Time Warner’s Operating Committee. Among other roles, he is an advisor and director to, and investor in, several private companies, including startups and turnarounds.

IPO Edge: What type of leadership qualities are most important in a successful SPAC?

Mr. Heyer: The most successful SPACs should have a mix of an operator who can see the potential in a business and someone with the financial mind needed to craft a deal. I really enjoyed working with Andy on Haymaker and we’re doing the same thing with Haymaker II. I’ve come to love him even more.

IPO Edge: What kind of company makes a good SPAC target?

Mr. Heyer: You look for a good business that has both growth and free cash flow. It should be differentiated from the rest of the market with a wide moat around the business. OneSpaWorld has all of those features and we were able to get a deal done with a fabulous company. We had almost no redemptions and great enthusiasm for the transaction.

IPO Edge: What are the reasons to do a SPAC versus a traditional IPO?

Mr. Heyer: If the owner wants to take significant money off the table immediately, a SPAC is better. It’s also an opportunity for the owner to roll some of the investment to participate in the upside of a well-performing stock.

However, for a SPAC to succeed, you need trust and motivation on both sides. That’s how we got a friendly, fast negotiation with OneSpaWorld.

IPO Edge: Is there a size limitation for SPAC IPOs? What’s helping them get bigger?

Mr. Heyer: We raised $400 million for Haymaker II but it could be a billion dollars. The issue is that you’re probably looking for a middle market deal, so you don’t need that much in the SPAC IPO. You’re not going to raise $5 billion.

With a more successful track record, you can attract investors who want to bet on your team before the target is known.

IPO Edge: How have SPACs been perceived over the years?

Mr. Heyer: If you go back 20 years, SPAC was a dirty word. The reason is that people were using them to line their pockets. They were being bad stewards. Even recently, we had a handful of investors who had a knee-jerk negative reaction to a SPAC because of that history. But with more successful deals, attitudes are changing. It’s evolved from being a niche vehicle to becoming a real asset class.

IPO Edge: You talked about cash flow. Could a SPAC deal be done with a fast-growing company that’s not yet profitable?

Mr. Heyer: I would do it if the growth story were compelling enough and the potential for meaningful profit creation was clear. The expectation needs to be that the business can float on its own and doesn’t hinge on a dozen promises or flawless integration. At some point it stretches credibility.

Phil Denning, Partner, ICR Inc.

SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. That’s according to Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay Holdings (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs. The full interview is below:

IPO Edge: What has been the main driver of the success of SPACs in the last several months?

Mr. Denning: One key feature of many successful deals has been the presence of a well-regarded private equity firm that has elected to keep a significant stake in the company after it goes public. It not only sends the message that the private equity firm believes in the business, but can be helpful as the company plots its strategy moving forward. We saw that with both OneSpaWorld, which has L Catterton as a shareholder and Repay, which has Corsair Capital as a shareholder. The role of the private equity firm is generally to advise in the form of one or more board directors. But you can also go with informal advisory roles or even more formal – such as an executive position created.

There has also been an element of creativity in recent deals that made them succeed. The Repay deal would have closed without the PIPE investors, but their additional capital made the terms even better because of the dilution that was eliminated. I think that the flexible nature of the product has fostered creative thinking, which has led to success.

IPO Edge: Warrant “coverage” has decreased in many recent deals – with some as low as ¼ per share. Do you believe that the warrant feature is likely to keep shrinking or do some deals need them?

Mr. Denning: The warrant can be a great incentive to get investors into a SPAC IPO, especially with a team that has a lot of potential but not a proven track record. There are investors out there who really just buy into a deal to get the warrant and have no intention of keeping the shares, and that’s fine – because it helps get the cash raised. But the idea is to attract investors who believe enough in a management team that they want to stick with the SPAC shares and wind up owning the target company.

You will probably always need some warrant feature to keep investors incentivized. After all, if you’re going to let your cash sit in a trust account and just earn minimal interest, you need a carrot.

There will be deals with very small fractions of a warrant. Those are going to be the SPACs whose leadership have very strong track records. For those newer to the game, a full warrant per share is probably going to remain the norm.

IPO Edge: Do you expect SPACs to get even larger in the next few years?

Mr. Denning: I actually think that SPACs under a billion dollars are the ideal size. If you get much bigger the company is probably best suited to go the typical IPO route.

The reason why SPACs may do so well at the current size is that there’s plethora of middle-market target companies owned by private equity. Many of those private equity firms are in a difficult position because the companies aren’t an ideal fit for an IPO, meaning they can only rally be sold to a strategic or another private equity firm. So SPACs have created an entirely new exit path.

And SPACs are more appealing than a straight sale because many private equity owners want to participate in further upside. If you sell the company to another firm, you obviously can’t do that.

IPO Edge: What are the key advantages to going public via a SPAC rather than a traditional IPO?

Mr. Denning: One major advantage I have observed relates to disclosure. With a SPAC, it’s relatively easy to communicate a target company’s growth plans once the deal is announced. You’re able to show the investment community specific targets for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda that you can’t with a traditional IPO. That takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for potential investors.

Another advantage from the perspective of a company owner is the ability to sell a large stake but also remain a significant holder. With an IPO, you’re really only selling a sliver of the company at the time of the deal.

SPACs can also happen much more quickly. If you raise money and find a target right away, a deal can be done in a matter of months. The IPO process is much more long and arduous.

IPO Edge: Are there specific industries that are best suited for SPACs?

Mr. Denning: There has been a lot of success with consumer and consumer-related deals, looking back to Hostess Brands and more recently to OneSpaWorld. But I think there is plenty of scope to grow in different industries. Just recently we had a real-estate SPAC deal announced with Broadmark, which is merging with Trinity Merger Corp. (ticker: TMCX). I would expect sponsors to get more creative as we see successful deals done in new industries.

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.'

With a market capitalization of US$635m, Repay Holdings is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about RPAY.

See our latest analysis for Repay Holdings

NasdaqCM:RPAY Ownership Summary, August 9th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Repay Holdings?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that Repay Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold 23% of the stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Repay Holdings's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

NasdaqCM:RPAY Income Statement, August 9th 2019 More

It would appear that 3.7% of Repay Holdings shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Repay Holdings

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

About Stabilis Energy, Inc.

Stabilis Energy, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of small-scale liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production, distribution and fueling services to multiple end markets in North America. Stabilis has safely delivered over 200 million gallons of LNG through more than 20,000 truck deliveries during its 15-year operating history in the LNG industry, which it believes makes it one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America. Stabilis’ customers use LNG as a fuel source in a variety of applications in the industrial, energy, mining, utilities and pipelines, commercial, and high horsepower transportation markets. Stabilis’ customers use LNG as an alternative to traditional fuel sources, such as distillate fuel oil and propane, to lower fuel costs and reduce harmful environmental emissions. Stabilis’ customers also use LNG as a “virtual pipeline” solution when natural gas pipelines are not available or volumes are curtailed. Stabilis Energy, Inc. is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

Forms Joint Venture with Grupo CLISA to Invest in LNG and CNG Assets

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / August 21, 2019 / Stabilis Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLNG) (“Stabilis”) today announced two strategic transactions that will expand its presence in the distributed liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) markets in Mexico. Stabilis has completed the acquisition of privately held Diversenergy, LLC (“Diversenergy”) and its subsidiaries to create one of the leading distributed LNG marketing and distribution companies in Mexico. In addition, Stabilis has completed the formation of a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) with Grupo CLISA and other former owners of Diversenergy to pursue investments in LNG and CNG assets in Mexico.

Diversenergy Acquisition

As one of the leading providers of LNG marketing and distribution services in Mexico, Diversenergy provides LNG to customers that use LNG as a fuel in mobile high horsepower applications and to customers that do not have natural gas pipeline access. As a result of the acquisition, Diversenergy and its Mexican subsidiary have become wholly owned subsidiaries of Stabilis. The transaction was structured as an equity purchase with Diversenergy’s owners receiving cash and Stabilis common stock consideration. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Lee Kellough, former CEO of Diversenergy, will serve as President of Stabilis’ Mexican subsidiary (Diversenergy S.A.P.I. de C.V.) and Senior Vice President of Stabilis.

“Stabilis is pleased to announce the acquisition of Diversenergy,” said Jim Reddinger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stabilis. “We see significant growth opportunities in the large and expanding market for LNG and CNG fuel in Mexico. We welcome Diversenergy to the Stabilis team and look forward to working together to bring clean, low cost, and abundant natural gas to our customers in Mexico.”

Lee Kellough added, “We are confident that this transaction creates a solid platform for Stabilis to become a leader in the LNG and CNG markets in Mexico. We believe that we have the right combination of people, equipment, and relationships to capitalize on the substantial growth opportunities we see throughout Mexico.”

Joint Venture Formed for Investment in LNG and CNG Assets in Mexico

In addition, Stabilis has formed a joint venture with CryoMex Investment Group LLC (“CryoMex”) to pursue investments in distributed natural gas production and distribution assets in Mexico. CryoMex is led by Grupo CLISA, a Monterrey, Mexico-based developer and operator of businesses in multiple end markets including energy.

The Joint Venture, operating as Energía Superior Gas Natural LLC, plans to invest in LNG and CNG production, transportation, storage, and regasification assets that serve multiple end markets throughout Mexico, including the industrial, mining, pipeline, utility, marine, and over-the-road transportation markets.

“Stabilis couldn’t ask for better partners than Grupo CLISA,” said Jim Reddinger. “Their existing partnerships with international companies to build and operate assets in Mexico demonstrate their ability to execute effectively and with integrity. We look forward to building a great distributed natural gas business in Mexico with our new partners.”

Gerardo Cavazos, Chief Executive Officer of Grupo CLISA added, “We share Stabilis’ view that there is vast potential for distributed natural gas solutions throughout Mexico and we believe that together we will be able to help build that market.”

The Joint Venture plans to begin immediately evaluating LNG and CNG asset development opportunities throughout Mexico, including in the Monterrey, Sonora, and Mexico City regions. These assets could include LNG liquefaction facilities, cryogenic rolling stock equipment, CNG compression stations, and pressurized rolling stock equipment, among others.

Thompson & Knight LLP acted as legal advisor to Stabilis. Jones Day LLP acted as legal advisor to Diversenergy and its owners.

Investor Call

Stabilis has scheduled an investor update call on Thursday August 22, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss this transaction. Individuals in the United States and Canada who wish to participate in the conference call should dial +1 844-602-0380. International callers should dial +1 862-298-0970.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

View our latest analysis for Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

Does Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 69% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Do The Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?

The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings. Nice! Along with insider transactions, I recommend checking if Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is growing revenue. This free chart of historic revenue and earnings should make that easy.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (NASDAQ:YRIV).

What Is Insider Selling?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

See our latest analysis for Yangtze River Port and Logistics

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Yangtze River Port and Logistics

Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Director, James Coleman, for US$402k worth of shares, at about US$1.14 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$0.89. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. The only individual insider seller over the last year was James Coleman.

James Coleman divested 513k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$1.05. The chart below shows insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Does Yangtze River Port and Logistics Boast High Insider Ownership?

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Yangtze River Port and Logistics insiders own about US$104m worth of shares (which is 68% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Yangtze River Port and Logistics Insiders?

An insider hasn't bought Yangtze River Port and Logistics stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP (“Scott+Scott”), an international securities and consumer rights litigation firm, is investigating whether certain directors and officers of Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (“Yangtze” or the “Company”) (YRIV) breached their fiduciary duties to Yangtze and its shareholders. If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may contact attorney Joe Pettigrew for additional information: 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

Scott+Scott is investigating whether members of Yangtze’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts, about Yangtze’s business, operations, prospects, and financial health. Specifically, Scott+Scott is investigating whether the Board failed to disclose material information, including whether: (1) Yangtze’s purported lease of Wuhan Newport, the Company’s main asset, was a fabrication; (2) Yangtze’s only operating subsidiary, Wuhan Newport, was declared insolvent in China due to a number of default judgments against it; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

On August 27, 2018, Barron’s published, “A Troubled Chinese Company Is Seeking a Lifeline From U.S. Investors,” revealing that Wuhan Newport was “showing up on official websites in which Chinese courts list debtors with unpaid legal judgments.” On this news, Yangtze stock fell $0.11 per share, or almost 1%, to close at $11.53 on August 27, 2018.

On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report, entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated,” which caused Yangtze stock to fall $3.34 per share – over 28% – over the next two trading days to close at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

What You Can Do

If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may have legal claims against Yangtze’s directors and officers. If you wish to discuss this investigation, or have questions about this notice or your legal rights, please contact attorney Joe Pettigrew toll-free at 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

LD Micro has always held the belief that our industry needs a truly accurate indicator of what is occurring in the micro-cap world.

With this reconstitution the index will contain 984 companies, a surprisingly similar number to what we had back in February. Nearly as many companies have “graduated” out of the index as those that have “graduated” in.

Performance since the close of January 31st, 2019:

Nasdaq: +12% (Very nice)

S&P500: +10.2% (Solid)

Dow Jones: +7.5% (Respectable)

Russell 2000: +5% (Better than CDs)

LD Micro Index: -2.8% (The night is still young)

A breakdown by exchange, sector, and complete constituent list is available at our website: http://www.ldmicro.com/the-index.

Chris Lahiji, President of LD Micro, stated ""As we turn four, more people in our industry are using the Index as an additional indicator for what is taking place on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Our goal has always been to add much needed insight to the space, and based on the dichotomy between micro, small, and large-cap, we feel our index provides the most accurate picture of micro-cap as a whole. As evidenced, micro-cap performance thus far in 2019 has been incredibly disconcerting.”

Companies being added to the index as of August 1st, 2019 are:

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

The notification also stated that the Company would be provided 180 calendar days, or until February 11, 2020, to regain compliance with the foregoing listing requirement. To do so, the bid price of the Company's common stock must close at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to that date.

If the Company does not regain compliance by the compliance deadline, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to remedy the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq staff will inform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the Nasdaq staff that the Company will not be able to remedy the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, the staff will provide notice that its securities will be subject to delisting. The Company cannot provide any assurance that its common shares will trade at levels necessary to regain and maintain compliance with the above-referenced bid price rule before the compliance deadline. The Company intends to continue to monitor the bid price for its common stock. If the Company's common shares do not trade at a level that is likely to regain compliance with the Nasdaq requirements, the Company's Board of Directors will consider alternative options that may be available to achieve compliance.

BEIJING, Sept. 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ChinaCache International Holdings Ltd. (“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced in a recent Form 6-K report that on September 4, 2019, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company stating that The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market.



The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting. Additionally, as of the date of this release, the Company continues to make progress with the completion of its delinquent annual report and intends to file these reports with the SEC. The Company intends to complete and file its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as soon as possible with the SEC. Thereafter, the Company intends to work with a market maker to file a Form 211 with FINRA to enable the Company’s shares to begin trading on the over-the-counter markets.

“While there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to execute its plan. If the shares resume trading on the over-the-counter markets, the shares may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on Nasdaq. While trading on the over-the-counter-markets the Company expects to apply for a Nasdaq listing at a future time.” concluded Mr. Liu.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced that a special committee comprised of independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”) has concluded the fact-finding portion of an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Song Wang (“Mr. Wang”), and allegations of enterprise bribery involving the Company that date back to 2014.



The Special Committee retained the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP to assist in conducting this investigation. While the Special Committee identified potential concerns relating to certain Company transactions that may indicate that improper payments were made in connection with the 2014 transaction at issue, it did not identify direct evidence indicating that Mr. Wang or any member of Company Management or the Board of Directors (the “Board”) engaged in or approved of any improper payment. It should be noted that the Special Committee’s investigation was constrained to some extent by the passage of time, significant turnover in Company personnel since 2014 and the lack of direct access to Mr. Wang. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Committee did identify weaknesses in the Company’s compliance program and recommended several improvements, including the addition of resources for compliance and internal audit functions and enhanced training. The Board has approved the adoption of all of these recommendations and the Company has begun implementing them.

The Board also accepted the resignation of two senior managers (including one who was also a director of the Company), who did not notify the Board of the arrest of Mr. Wang until May 16, 2019. It is the understanding of the Special Committee that during the absence of Mr. Wang, from around January 16, 2019 until May 16, 2019, the Company’s operations were managed by other members of the Company’s management team, including a member thereof who exercised certain management authority under power of attorney granted by Mr. Wang prior to his detention.

To enhance its commitment to stringent corporate governance standards, the Board was recently reconstituted by appointing three new directors. The reconstituted Board consists of two independent directors and two executive directors. The Chairman of the Board and all members of the audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance committees are independent. In addition, the management of the Company is currently led by Mr. Bin Liu, the acting chief executive officer, who was appointed to replace Mr. Wang on May 17, 2019. The Company intends to add a third independent director to the Board in the near term to ensure that there are three independent directors on the audit committee and that a majority of the directors on the Board are independent, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules.

L Catterton Enters Into Definitive Agreement to Sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille to Landry's, Inc.

IRVING, Texas and GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Del Frisco's"") and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced the completion of the transaction under which L Catterton has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Del Frisco's for approximately $650 million.

The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""We are confident that the separation of the business and the sale of the steak concepts to Landry's creates the best opportunity to unlock value in all of the Company's restaurant brands,"" said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. ""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Mr. Taub added, ""We look forward to leveraging L Catterton's deep restaurant experience and operational capabilities to help bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar reach their full potential.

IRVING, Texas, June 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions. Engaged Capital and certain of its affiliates, collectively holding nearly 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, have entered into voting agreements committing them to, among other things and subject to its terms, vote in favor of adopting the acquisition agreement.

“Over the course of our review, the Committee evaluated a full range of strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives to best serve the interests of our stockholders. After a thorough process, including considering Del Frisco’s current operations and future prospects, the Committee and the Board is confident that this transaction offers the most promising opportunity to realize the highest value for our stockholders,” said Joe Reece, Committee Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“In consultation with our outside advisors, the Board has been evaluating several strategic and financial alternative options since December 2018. This transaction offers immediate liquidity at a significant premium for our stockholders while providing the best path forward for our Del Frisco’s brands, our employees, and loyal guests,” said Ian R. Carter, Board Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“L Catterton brings a distinguished track record of fostering the growth and success of world class experiential brands. Together with their deep operational expertise in the restaurant industry, I am confident L Catterton will be a great long-term partner,” said Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

Del Frisco’s comprises four leading brands across two distinct business lines -- Del Frisco’s Grille and Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in the steak and grill category, and bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar in the upscale regionally-inspired cuisine category. Upon the close of the transaction, L Catterton plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar businesses separately from the steakhouse brands in order to nurture the unique attributes of the brands.

“At L Catterton, we bring more than just capital – we bring significant operational expertise to our investments,” said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. “Over the last 30 years, L Catterton has invested in nearly 30 restaurant concepts globally to create a number of industry leaders. Del Frisco’s has four outstanding brands in two distinct and attractive categories – upscale regionally-inspired cuisine, and steak and grill. We’re excited to partner with the Company to harness the power of these brands by operating the upscale regionally-inspired brands separately from the steak and grill concepts.”

L Catterton has invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin' Brands Inc. (including Outback Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill), CÉ LA VI, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Crystal Jade, Culinary Concepts by Jean-Georges, P.F. Chang's, Uncle Julio’s and many more.

The billionaire owner of casinos, restaurants and the NBA’s Houston Rockets had coveted Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group Inc. since 2012. This summer it looked improbable that his Landry’s Inc. restaurant group would get a shot. Private equity firm L Catterton had struck a deal to acquire the high-end chain in June and, as recently as Tuesday, bankers were busy trying to sell debt to fund the transaction.

But, in a surprise twist, Fertitta popped up to snare the coveted steakhouses.

L Catterton completed its $650 million purchase Wednesday, but immediately announced it was selling Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouses and Del Frisco’s Grilles to Landry’s for an undisclosed sum. The buyout firm will keep bartaco, a purveyor of tacos and tequila, and Barcelona Wine Bar brands.

“It’s something that I’ve looked at for years and sometimes you just have to wait for the deal to come back to you,” Fertitta, 62, said in a phone interview.

Del Frisco’s operates more than 35 restaurants, including Del Frisco’s Double Eagle in Midtown Manhattan, a favorite with the finance crowd, offering its signature 45-day dry-aged double-bone prime ribeye for $140 and a tasting of three wagyu steaks at $205.

It also has locations in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, and one in Washington that caters to lobbyists and politicians. On the night of the deal, a sign indicated that Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was there.

Despite the chain’s popularity with Wall Street, bankers labored to sell $425 million of debt to fund L Catterton’s buyout. Credit Suisse Group AG offered an all-in yield of 9.6%, people familiar with the matter said this month. But with concerns growing about the effects a potential recession may have on a cyclical business, especially expensive steakhouses and wine bars, some investors remained skeptical.

A spokeswoman for L Catterton declined to comment.

Fertitta, who’s worth $3.9 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, also said he couldn’t comment on why L Catterton sold the assets, but he’s a big believer in steak.

The Houston businessman already owns nine steakhouse chains, including Morton’s and Mastro’s. He even opened a female-focused one with actress Eva Longoria in 2013 that’s now closed. Fertitta said he’s willing to put more equity into the Del Frisco’s business and isn’t concerned about the long-term prospects, including the threat from meat substitutes.

“I’ll do whatever I need to do,” said Fertitta, who’s also the chairman and chief executive officer of Fertitta Entertainment, which operates the Golden Nugget casinos. “Steak’s always gonna be the most popular food in the world.”

Fertitta may see a challenge from meat substitutes as consumers flock to restaurants for plant-based burgers from Beyond Meat Inc. and Impossible Foods Inc. Fertitta said the hype of meatless burgers is overblown and that consumers will return to red meat once they realize the products aren’t as healthy as they’re made out to be.

Still, he’s open to serving the trendy plant-based product “if the customers want them,” he said.

Fertitta, who counts Jefferies Financial Group Inc. head Richard Handler as a close friend, used the bank as Landry’s lead adviser on the deal, along with Deutsche Bank Securities and North Point Advisors.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment, today released the following summary review of the clinical trials and efficacy findings for Endari®.

""In light of our decision to withdraw our marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine), there is some confusion relating to the previous clinical trials and efficacy findings that led to Endari's approval by the FDA in 2017,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following summary to our shareholders and the SCD community.""

Endari Clinical Trial Results

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

https://www.emmausmedical.com/content/ceoletters/ceo-letter-sep-10-2019-193

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari

XLRN announced the discontinuation of a phase II study evaluating its pipeline candidate, ACE-083, in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Although the candidate achieved growth in muscle volume in FSHD patients, it failed to deliver a meaningful functional benefit on top of it.

Data from the study showed that ACE-083 achieved statistically significant increase in mean total muscle volume, the study’s primary endpoint. However, the company announced that the increase in muscle volume failed to translate into improvements in functional tests of statistical significance, representing secondary endpoints. This failure resulted in the company’s decision to discontinue further development of the candidate in FSHD patients.

So far this year, Acceleron stock has gained 2.7% against the industry’s decline of 1.2%.

Meanwhile, the company continues to develop ACE-083 as a treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, another neuromuscular disorder in a phase II study. Top-line data from this study is expected in the first quarter of 2020.

We note that the company had discontinued development of another pipeline candidate, ACE-2494 in April. The candidate was being developed in a phase I study as a potential treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Higher frequency of anti-drug antibodies generation was observed in patients, which was the primary reason behind the discontinuation of its development.

Acceleron is developing its lead pipeline candidate, luspatercept, in collaboration with Celgene CELG for the treatment of chronic anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes, beta-thalassemia and myelofibrosis.

Two regulatory applications seeking approval for the candidate as a treatment for beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes associated anemia are under review with the FDA.

Currently, the company is also developing sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”), a rare disease with high unmet medical need. The FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to sotatercept for PAH earlier this month.

In June, Acceleron completed enrolling patients in the PULSAR study and plans to report top-line data from the same in the first quarter of 2020. Also, the company is currently recruiting subjects in the SPECTRA exploratory study to have a better understanding of sotatercept's potential impact on PAH. Preliminary results from this study are expected in 2020.

The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $22.33 to $23.29 in the past one-month time frame.

The company has seen three negative estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few weeks, suggesting there may be trouble down the road. So, make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.

Finisar will demonstrate the latest form factors, laser technology, and test equipment for high-speed connections in hyperscale data centers, 5G wireless networks, and optical test systems. See these demonstrations and more in Finisar's booth 62 at the RDS Venue in Dublin, September 23-25.

400GBASE-SR4.2 QSFP-DD transceivers for high-speed data centers

Finisar and Foxconn Interconnect Technology are showcasing the industry's first interoperability demonstration of 400G SR4.2 QSFP-DD optical transceivers at the Finisar booth. These IEEE-compliant transceivers use eight fibers and an MPO-12 optical connector which provide a low total cost solution for 400G data rate upgrades using the installed base of multimode cabling deployed for 100G SR4 in data centers today. The IEEE P802.3cm task force has made a baseline proposal for 400GBASE-SR4.2 which includes support for up to 70m on OM3 and 100m on OM4 multimode fiber, aligned with the 400G BiDi MSA. This is the second short-reach 400G multimode transceiver announced by Finisar, following the 400G SR8 OSFP module demonstrated at OFC earlier this year.

100G PAM4 VCSEL technology for hyperscale data centers

Finisar is unveiling the industry's first public technology demonstration of a multimode VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) transmitting at 100G data rates using PAM4 modulation. This technology demonstration is a critical milestone towards product developments that can enable 800G short-reach optical modules and active optical cables (AOCs) needed for next-generation hyperscale data centers. Traditionally, multimode transceivers and AOCs that utilize VCSEL technology have offered the lowest cost for short-reach interconnect applications, a trend that is expected to continue with 800G+ products that are based on 100G PAM4 per lane. Attendees will be able to observe the optical performance of the prototype VCSEL’s over multimode fiber using a high-speed scope.

5G Wireless Front-haul Ecosystem featuring Tunable SFP28 transceivers

Finisar is showcasing various optical transceiver modules for 5G wireless front-haul networks. Driven by the anticipation of very large volume deployments, wireless front-haul applications will require cost-efficient high data rate solutions. Such applications in 5G networks are expected to require primarily 25G data rates, and Finisar is already offering several products covering 300m, 2km and 10km reaches. For 10km, Finisar provides both duplex and bidirectional transceiver solutions to help customers with optical fiber constraints. For C-RAN applications, Finisar is demonstrating LAN-WDM and O-band CWDM solutions, which enable more efficient wireless front haul networks with a minimum number of optical fibers.

As part of its 5G product offering, Finisar is also demonstrating full C-band DWDM wavelength tunable SFP28 modules operating at 25Gb/s over 15km of single mode fiber. These transceivers provide significant advantages over fixed wavelength solutions for carriers upgrading their networks to the latest wireless standards. Leveraging DWDM technology allows more efficient use of the limited installed fiber in the front-haul network. Finisar’s market-leading wavelength tunable SFP28 transceivers also provide operational efficiencies and savings over fixed wavelength products. These products will be available with Finisar’s patented Flextune™ wavelength self-tuning functionality.

WaveAnalyzer 1500S High Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer

The WaveAnalyzer™ 1500S demonstrates high speed and high-resolution measurements on optical signals in the L-band of telecommunications, including OSNR and WDM analysis. This instrument has been designed to support developers of next-generation optical systems.

This compares to earnings of $0.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.55%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering no surprise.

Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.

Gladstone Capital, which belongs to the Zacks Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry industry, posted revenues of $12.52 million for the quarter ended March 2019, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.64%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.09 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Gladstone Capital shares have added about 30.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.5%.

What's Next for Gladstone Capital?

While Gladstone Capital has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gladstone Capital was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.22 on $12.51 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.86 on $49.91 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry is currently in the bottom 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Loan investors expect commitments due on at least 10 deals for $6 billion, while the pipeline is thin for junk-rated issuance. Investment-grade borrowers may sell about $15 billion of bonds.

The syndication of loans and a high-yield bond to finance Apollo Global Management Inc.’s buyout of online retailer Shutterfly are expected to continue this week after failing to sell following investor pushback on price and terms. Commitments on the reworked debt sale were due Friday after banks had to fund the LBO, which closed before the loans and bonds could price after negotiations with investors dragged out.

Loans with commitments this week include technology solutions provider CDW’s $1.45 billion refinancing loan, Guidehouse’s $640 million of debt to help finance its planned acquisition of Navigant Consulting Inc. and Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc.’s $440 million loan. Meanwhile, Merlin Entertainments may launch a jumbo cross-border deal as soon as this week. The buyout loan may include about $592 million in U.S. dollar term loans as well as a U.S. dollar bridge facility.

Borrowers have launched loans worth about $50 billion so far this month, making September the biggest month for new deals in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Several companies including Shutterfly struggled to attract demand last week as investors forced some issuers to hike yields and sweeten terms.

Some junk-rated borrowers may hold off on plans to issue new debt this week to give investors time to digest the recent deluge of new bonds. Supply is favorable for money managers despite issuance remaining light, with net sales currently at negative $3.2 billion year-to-date, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. About $49 billion of bonds have left the junk market as companies got upgraded to investment-grade, which more than offset the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance that added to junk volume, according to the bank.

“More than 72% of this year’s gross issuance has been associated with debt repayment and/or refinancing,” Goldman Sachs credit analysts led by Lofti Karoui wrote in a report last week. “As a result, a portion of the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance likely includes maturities that have been ‘pre-funded’ but have not yet reached their call (or maturity) date, resulting in an artificially inflated net supply figure (until those maturities formally roll off).”

In the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market, dealers are projecting as much as $15 billion in new supply over the five days. A record 127 issuers have taken advantage of the current low interest rates and heightened investor demand to borrow over $154 billion for debt refinancing in September.

“If rates stay here I think supply will be heavy going into the end of the year,” Scott Colyer, chairman and chief executive officer at Advisors Asset Management Inc., said in an interview. “Because the absolute cost of borrowing is so low, companies will think of borrowing and with rates this cheap, M&A and share buyback look pretty good.”

In the distressed world, bondholders will be keeping a close eye on debt payments due Monday, including from Intelsat SA, Mallinckrodt Plc, Iconix Brand Group Inc., Jason Industries Inc. and Ultra Petroleum Corp.

Credit investors will also be watching for potential market volatility that may be sparked by the repurchase agreements market. The Federal Reserve is gearing up for the third quarter, with $100 billion overnight repo operations expected to be repeated Monday.

“Spreads are narrow, there’s plenty of liquidity so at this point in time, the credit markets are just fine, operating as they should,” said Colyer. “As we get closer to the end of the cycle, we have started to move up the credits quality scale.”

For perspective, there have been only 5 occasions in those 40 years when the S&P 500 declined by greater than 20% from peak to trough. Other than the '87 Crash, all were during recessions. There were 17 other instances, over the same time frame, when the market fell by over 10% but less than 20%. Furthermore, this is the 18th correction of 5% or more since the current bull market started in March '09. Corrections are the norm. They can be healthy as they often undo market complacency—overbought levels—potentially allowing the market to base and move even higher.""

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

Marks 20th Anniversary of ePort Debut with “Powering Your Unattended World” Themed Booth; Showcases Cutting-Edge Technologies, Partnerships and New Research

The NAMA Show - Today, USA Technologies (USAT) (“USAT”), a premier digital payment, consumer engagement and logistics service provider for the self-service retail market, marked the 20th anniversary of the debut of the ePort which was first unveiled at NAMA in 1999, bringing one of the first cashless payment platforms to the self-serve retail industry. With an eye toward USAT’s continued leadership in innovation, USAT branded its booth, “Powering Your Unattended World,” and showcased new technologies, partnerships and research throughout the show.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190426005366/en/

“Twenty years ago, we ushered in the era of cashless in the vending market with ePort Connect,” said Stephen P. Herbert, CEO of USA Technologies. “Since then, USAT has been at the helm of industry innovation, a change agent powering cashless adoption industry-wide. Early on, we began to recognize the benefits and opportunities possible through cashless technologies. USAT has since grown to support over 15,000 customers and approximately one million connections. We believe we have one of the largest NFC mobile footprints in the US retail market. We were excited to celebrate this incredible accomplishment at NAMA and look forward to continuing to drive innovation and shape the self-serve retail marketplace for decades to come.”

During the show, USAT’s booth focused on the strength of its enterprise platform for unattended retail through its booth design and messaging: bringing consumer engagement and rewards, the benefits of both top-line revenue opportunities through digital payments and the bottom-line margin opportunities through increased efficiencies, logistics and merchandising.

Seed Markets Expansion: USAT announced that Seed Markets is now fully integrated with some of the industry’s large micro market providers, including 365 Retail Markets, Avanti Markets, Company Kitchen, Three Square Market and Yoke Payments. Through the Seed Markets’ cloud-based and mobile solution, micro market operators can now benefit from one standard set of tools including simplified route management, efficient warehouse pre-picking, a single reporting interface and cash accountability.

Michigan State University Study on Low Performing Machines: While many vending operators prioritize equipping high-volume machines with cashless technology, USAT’s study in partnership with Michigan State University found that low performing machines can offer significant revenue growth as well. Vending operators who added cashless technology to machines with less than $2,000 a year in sales experienced top line sales growth of 110 percent on average over the first 18 months following deployment, and cash sales increased by an average of 97 percent on the low performing machines during that same period. The results were presented on the show floor on Thursday, April 25th during NAMA Learning Lab and the full press release announcing the results can be found here.

Participating partners include 365 markets, ShelfX, and Bunn. Starbucks and Avanti Markets are also showcasing USAT’s technology in their booths.

“USA Technologies has been a great partner,” said Karalynn McDermott, Senior Vice President of Market Development at Bunn-O-Matic Corporation. “The support and reliability we receive from USA Technologies, as well as their proven system, allows us to grow and innovate. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the company as the convenience service industry continues to grow.”

“Imperial has been a Seed customer for more than 10 years, and it has completely revolutionized our business,” said Lance Whorton President of Imperial Companies. “Through USAT’s Seed technology, we can now ensure our machines are full, our routes are growing and our products are targeted to the preferences of consumers. This ensures we are bringing a better experience to our clients and consumers while increasing our top line sales which continue to grow year-over-year-over-year.”

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

View our latest analysis for Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

Does Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 69% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Do The Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?

The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings. Nice! Along with insider transactions, I recommend checking if Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is growing revenue. This free chart of historic revenue and earnings should make that easy.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

View our latest analysis for Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

Does Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 69% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Do The Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?

The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings. Nice! Along with insider transactions, I recommend checking if Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is growing revenue. This free chart of historic revenue and earnings should make that easy.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(OTCQB:ADOM), a provider of advanced zero-emission and hybrid vehicle drivetrain solutions and purpose-built electric vehicles, presented at the Florida Utility Electric Vehicle Roundtable in Orlando on September 17th, 2019.

The host utility, Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC), and Florida Municipal Electric Association (FMEA) invited Florida's electric utilities to come together for their third Florida Utility Electric Vehicle Roundtable to discuss the current electric vehicle (EV) landscape in Florida, the impact EVs are having and will have on the electric utility industry, what utilities are doing to prepare, and issues, challenges and opportunities the industry is facing. The roundtable was open to all Florida electric utilities - municipal, cooperative and investor-owned and to Sustainability Program Managers, Conservation and Efficiency Managers, Regulatory and Compliance Personnel, Renewables Coordinators, Electrical Engineers, Utility Directors and Managers, Policymakers and EV Coordinators.

Florida's 33 municipal electric utilities, combined, are the third largest electric provider in the state. Florida's public power utilities serve more than 1.4 million customer accounts and are a statewide employment leader with 5,400+ employees.

Doug Lollar of ADOMANI spoke about its zero-emission product offering of electric trucks, vans and neighborhood electric vehicles. Other speakers included Peter King of Duke Energy who spoke about choosing electric vehicle charging station locations, April Groover Combs of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services provided information to those in attendance about the Florida Electric Vehicle Roadmap, and John Paul Fraites of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection reviewed and gave an overview of the Volkswagen Settlement - Mitigation Plan and Timeframe as it pertains to Florida. The Diesel Emissions Mitigation Program (DEMP) uses funding from the Volkswagen Settlement and the EPA's Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) State Grant Program to provide project-specific funding to mitigate mobile sources of emissions. The primary objective of the Diesel Emissions Mitigation Program is to fund projects that reduce mobile source emissions such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and organic hazardous air pollutants.

ADOMANI will have a zero-emission electric cut-a-way commercial van product in Florida for demonstrations to utility companies and other interested parties over the next few weeks.

Second Quarter 2019 Revenue of $7.3 Million, Up 18% Quarter-Over-Quarter



First Half 2019 Revenue of $13.6 Million, Up 40% Year-Over-Year

Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AESE) (or the “Company”), today provided financial results for the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2019 as well as an update on several key business initiatives. As previously announced, the Company was formed on August 9, 2019 as a result of the completion of a business combination among Black Ridge Acquisition Corp., Allied Esports International, Inc., WPT Enterprises, Inc. and other affiliates.

“In the second quarter and through the first half of 2019, we successfully executed on our business plan and are excited about how both Allied Esports and WPT are performing,” said Frank Ng, CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “We are confident in our long-term strategy and look forward to continuing to drive growth and maximize shareholder value.”

Capital Structure and Liquidity

The business combination generated $20.8 million in gross proceeds for the Company. The table below outlines total cash following transaction-related expenses and payments.

(USD, millions) Cash on Balance Sheet1 $ 7.0 Proceeds From Business Combination 20.8 Transaction Expenses and Cash Considerations2 (6.1 ) Total Cash3 $ 21.7

1 Cash on Balance Sheet of Allied and WPT as of June 30, 2019 2 Includes all cash transaction costs and cash paid at closing 3 Pro forma for business combination as of June 30, 2019. Includes restricted cash specifically allocated for strategic initiatives

After close of the business combination, the Company’s basic and diluted common shares outstanding totaled 23.1 million shares.

Allied and WPT Financial Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

Revenues: Total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased 17.7% to $7.3 million from $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a $0.3 million increase in In-person revenues primarily generated from the Company’s flagship Esports Arena Las Vegas and gaming truck events, as well as a $0.8 million increase in Multiplatform revenues related to the distribution of WPT content. Total second quarter 2019 revenues derived from WPT grew 5% to $5.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019 while revenues from Allied Esports grew 60% to $2.3 million over the previous quarter. The Allied Esports growth was driven by an increase in revenues generated at the Company’s flagship HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, which opened in March 2018, as well as increased revenue from the company’s gaming truck events.

Revenue (in thousands) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, March 31, Percentage June 30, June 30, Percentage 2019 2019 Change 2019 2018 Change Revenues: Multiplatform $ 1,657 $ 852 94.5 % $ 2,509 $ 1,172 114.1 % Interactive 2,378 2,386 -0.3 % 4,764 4,681 1.8 % In-person 3,303 2,997 10.2 % 6,300 3,866 63.0 % Total revenues $ 7,338 $ 6,235 17.7 % $ 13,573 $ 9,719 39.7 %

Costs and expenses: Total costs and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $10.1 million, consistent with the previous quarter. Increases of $1.0 million in multiplatform costs due primarily to increased productions costs and commissions were largely offset by reductions in Interactive expenses and the lack of any additional impairment related to the company’s reduced ownership of Esports Arena Orange County and Esports Arena Oakland.

Expenses (in thousands) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, March 31, Percentage June 30, June 30, Percentage 2019 2019 Change 2019 2018 Change Cost and expenses: Multiplatform (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 1,540 $ 581 165.1 % $ 2,121 $ 1,054 101.2 % Interactive (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 515 892 -42.3 % 1,407 1,290 9.1 % In-person (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 753 738 2.0 % 1,491 2,778 -46.3 % Online operating expenses 253 277 -8.7 % 530 1,771 -70.1 % Selling and marketing expenses 1,036 903 14.7 % 1,939 2,841 -31.7 % General and administrative expenses 4,254 4,412 -3.6 % 8,666 8,494 2.0 % Depreciation and amortization 1,732 1,686 2.7 % 3,418 3,336 2.5 % Impairment of investment in ESA - 600 - 600 4,338 -86.2 % Total costs and expenses $ 10,083 $ 10,089 -0.1 % $ 20,172 $ 25,902 -22.1 %

Loss from operations in the three months ended June 30, 2019 improved to $2.7 million from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net loss improved to $2.8 million from $3.9 million in the previous quarter.

Second quarter adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, improved by 35.5% to $(1.0) million from $(1.6) million in the first quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of the GAAP-basis net loss to EBITDA is provided in the table at the end of this press release.

Operational Update

Strategic Alliances: As previously announced, Simon, a global leader in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, and TV Azteca, a premier sports television network in Mexico, have made equity investments into Allied Esports Entertainment and are launching strategic alliances with the Company.

Simon and Allied Esports will collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the U.S. The in-mall venues will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events. The two companies plan to announce additional details for The Simon Cup, a co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival this fall combining online and in-person play at select mall locations in the New York and Los Angeles markets, with the winners of the regionals moving on to HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas for the final.

TV Azteca and Allied Esports will continue to work together to expand the esports landscape in Mexico through a number of immediate initiatives, including creating a 24-hour digital esports channel dedicated to esports and video gaming for the Mexican market and developing a network of esports talent across Mexico and Latin America. Future considerations also include building a flagship esports venue and additional esports and content facilities in Mexico and developing a localized online esports tournament platform for the market.

(NASDAQ:AESE)?,"A look at the shareholders of Allied Esports Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:AESE) can tell us which group is most powerful. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.'

With a market capitalization of US$96m, Allied Esports Entertainment is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions don't own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about AESE.

View our latest analysis for Allied Esports Entertainment

NasdaqCM:AESE Ownership Summary, August 22nd 2019 More

What Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Allied Esports Entertainment?

We don't tend to see institutional investors holding stock of companies that are very risky, thinly traded, or very small. Though we do sometimes see large companies without institutions on the register, it's not particularly common.

There are multiple explanations for why institutions don't own a stock. The most common is that the company is too small relative to fund under management, so the institition does not bother to look closely at the company. It is also possible that fund managers don't own the stock because they aren't convinced it will perform well. Allied Esports Entertainment might not have the sort of past performance institutions are looking for, or perhaps they simply have not studied the business closely.

NasdaqCM:AESE Income Statement, August 22nd 2019 More

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Allied Esports Entertainment. As far I can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.

Insider Ownership Of Allied Esports Entertainment

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Leading Destination Operator to Purchase $5 Million of Shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. and Collaborate with Allied Esports to Build Esports Venues at Simon Properties

“Simon Cup” Tournaments and Activations with HyperX Esports Truck to Launch at Select Simon Locations This Fall

Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (BRAC), a public acquisition vehicle, today announced that it has entered into a letter agreement for Simon Equity Development, LLC, a wholly-owned and indirect subsidiary of Simon Property Group (SPG), to become a shareholder of Allied Esports, a global esports entertainment company, through an equity investment in Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.

As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame International Holdings Limited, will be acquired, once all applicable shareholder and regulatory consents have been obtained, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. to form Allied Esports Entertainment (the “Business Combination”).

Highlights from the letter agreement include:

Simon acquiring $5 million in shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp.;

Simon and Allied Esports creating dedicated esports venues and experiences at select Simon locations throughout the United States; and

Simon and Allied Esports launching a new competition tour called The Simon Cup.

The obligations of the parties to move forward with the transactions contemplated by the letter agreement are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including but not limited to the execution of definitive agreements between the parties documenting the obligations of Simon to purchase the shares of Black Ridge and consummation of the Business Combination.

Simon and Allied Esports will also collaborate to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select Simon destinations around the country. The in-mall arenas will be designed for tournament play and daily use with the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events.

“We're extremely pleased to collaborate with Black Ridge and Allied Esports, leading innovators in esports and gaming, to bring cutting-edge venues to our iconic properties around the country. This is exactly the type of innovative activation that excites our customers and drives traffic for our centers at Simon. Simon's successful locations are ideally suited to provide these new and exciting community spaces, complementing our other dynamic offerings,” said Mark Silvestri, Simon's Chief Operating Officer for Development.

“The agreement with Simon is a landmark opportunity to bring Allied Esports’ vision for the future of competitive gaming to Simon's world class property network,” said Lyle Berman, Director of Black Ridge. “As we work to close the transaction combining our NASDAQ-listed Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. with Allied Esports and WPT, the significant investment by Simon would be a testament to our unrivaled plans and to the opportunity Simon sees to participate in this growing industry.”

In addition, Allied Esports and Simon will this year launch The Simon Cup, a groundbreaking, co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament festival combining online and in-person elements into a uniquely integrated content format. The activation includes regional tournament events at select Simon centers in the New York and Los Angeles markets, culminating in a Grand Final at the iconic HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“Simon’s commitment and investment in our growing esports ecosystem will immediately strengthen our foundation for creating live experiences and compelling content for gamers and fans around the world,” said Frank Ng, co-CEO of Ourgame, owner of Allied Esports. “We are thrilled for the opportunity to work closely with the forward-thinking team at Simon to design specialized mall-based esports concepts that we hope will attract new audiences and partners through their network and enhance our global presence.”

Assuming the parties execute a definitive agreement for the transaction, Simon would purchase $5 million of newly issued shares of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. at a price equal to the price at which Black Ridge shareholders can have their shares converted for a pro rata portion of the Black Ridge trust account upon closing of the Business Combination; however, the dollar amount of newly issued shares will be reduced by the dollar amount Simon spends, at its sole option, purchasing shares of common stock of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Simon has agreed not to seek conversion of any shares it purchases pursuant to this investment at the meeting called to approve the Business Combination. In consideration of the purchase commitment, Black Ridge would issue to Simon on closing of the Business Combination one additional share of Black Ridge common stock for every ten (10) shares that are purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment and a warrant to purchase one (1) share of Black Ridge common stock for every two (2) shares purchased pursuant to the purchase commitment. For additional information on the transaction, see Black Ridge’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed promptly and which can be obtained, without charge, on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website (http://www.sec.gov).

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. Given the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and the Company’s pending Chapter 11 cases, the Company does not plan to appeal the Nasdaq determination to delist the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, trading of the Company’s common stock and warrants will be suspended at the opening of business on September 24, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company expects the common stock and warrants to be traded over-the-counter under the symbol “AMRQ” and “AMRWWQ” and expects to continue filing its annual, quarterly and current reports in accordance with the requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

SEATTLE, Aug. 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced an entirely new, open and extensible software platform to address the growing need for supercomputing across government and private industries. As advanced simulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation create new, data intensive workloads, the need for performance at scale is growing rapidly. Recognizing the challenges presented by the exascale era, Cray’s software fuses supercomputing performance and capability with the modularity, composability and ease-of-use of cloud computing. In a separate press release issued today, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) announced that Cray has been awarded a third U.S. exascale system contract. The system, dubbed “El Capitan,” will be sited at LLNL. Cray now has $1.5 billion in business for Shasta™ supercomputing systems and the new software platform.



“The Shasta software used with the El Capitan system expands traditional supercomputing to support the complex workflows and numerous 3D studies necessary to unlock the full potential of exascale computing,” said Bill Goldstein, lab director at LLNL. “The flexibility and extensibility of El Capitan’s software and hardware environment will enable the NNSA laboratories to explore and develop capabilities that leverage the combination of AI and machine learning with modeling and simulation to accelerate time-to-solution for our national security codes. These technologies could apply equally well to multi-physics codes employed outside of the national security domain.”

Cray has a rich history of developing the most performant, scalable and reliable software in supercomputing. This is validated by the vast majority of global weather centers that rely on Cray to deliver time critical numerical weather forecasts. These weather centers are at the forefront of the convergence of HPC, AI and IoT workloads that operate at immense scale.

Cray’s new software platform improves performance and reliability by including new key capabilities:

Extends traditional HPC batch workflow scheduling for modeling and simulation with new Kubernetes container orchestration to enable converged HPC and AI workflows.

Adds support for multi-tenancy between HPC and AI partitions and sub-partitioning within AI jobs to enable workflow isolation.

Provides highly resilient containerized services with separate compute and management planes to minimize planned and unplanned downtime.

Creates an open supercomputing platform by including standardized and supported APIs for integration, data access and software ecosystem extensibility and interoperability.

Delivers a new and fully integrated telemetry for the system as well as user application level monitoring to quickly correlate and remediate issues.

“As we enter the exascale era, modern applications are creating the need for applying supercomputing capability to a new class of digital transformation problems. What is the domain of a few national laboratories today is fast becoming a necessity for every enterprise,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO, Cray, Inc. “With our new software platform, Cray is delivering a fully featured, extensible software and tools environment that performs like a supercomputer and runs like a cloud. The same Cray technology that powers exascale systems can be delivered in a single, low-cost rack and ready to integrate into any data center environment.”

With this next generation supercomputing software platform, Cray has addressed key requirements:

Application development and portability : Developers can easily compose converged modeling, simulation, analytics and AI workflows using modern microservices and a robust suite of tools and compilers that support a broad spectrum of processors and accelerators. Applications can easily move from laptop to supercomputer for maximum scalability of code with minimal refactoring.

Interoperability: IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols.

IT managers and administrators can deploy Cray technology with the assurance that both current and future requirements are covered with broad data center systems and software interoperability with the addition of documented APIs for automation and data access, and support for industry standard protocols. Investment protection: CXOs and business owners benefit from a multi-user and multipurpose platform with support for heterogeneous processor architectures (x86, AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, FPGAs and other accelerators) and the scalability to meet their rapidly growing analytics and AI initiatives.

“Shasta is designed to support extremely heterogeneous workloads not just from science and engineering, but also from the growing contingent of enterprises that acquire supercomputers to outcompete their rivals in the new era of digital transformation and AI,” said Steve Conway, COO and senior vice president of research at Hyperion Research. “Cray Shasta supercomputers aim to move leading enterprises beyond proof-of-concept to production, and to operate on premises or in the cloud. By integrating extremely heterogeneous requirements into the new Shasta system hardware and software, Cray has substantially expanded its addressable market to include enterprise analytics, AI and cloud computing.”

Cray’s new software platform will be available starting Q4 of 2019. For more information, please contact your authorized Cray sales representative or www.cray.com .

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

(CRAY) ?,"How do we determine whether Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) makes for a good investment at the moment? We analyze the sentiment of a select group of the very best investors in the world, who spend immense amounts of time and resources studying companies. They may not always be right (no one is), but data shows that their consensus long positions have historically outperformed the market when we adjust for known risk factors.

Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) shareholders have witnessed an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. Our calculations also showed that CRAY isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in our short portfolio.

(NASDAQ:DVCR) Share Register?","Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!

The big shareholder groups in Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:DVCR) have power over the company. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes 'a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people'. So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

Diversicare Healthcare Services is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$17m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about DVCR.

Check out our latest analysis for Diversicare Healthcare Services

NasdaqCM:DVCR Ownership Summary, June 19th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Diversicare Healthcare Services?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

Diversicare Healthcare Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 26% of the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Diversicare Healthcare Services's historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

NasdaqCM:DVCR Income Statement, June 19th 2019 More

Our data indicates that hedge funds own 6.8% of Diversicare Healthcare Services. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Our information suggests that there isn't any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies include constipation, nausea, headache, and abdominal pain.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment, today released the following summary review of the clinical trials and efficacy findings for Endari®.

""In light of our decision to withdraw our marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine), there is some confusion relating to the previous clinical trials and efficacy findings that led to Endari's approval by the FDA in 2017,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following summary to our shareholders and the SCD community.""

Endari Clinical Trial Results

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

https://www.emmausmedical.com/content/ceoletters/ceo-letter-sep-10-2019-193

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock.

The pro forma combined balance sheets as of March 31, 2019, after giving effect to the conversion, as well as the final terms of the merger agreement and additional information about Emmaus, can be found in the company's July 22, 2019 Form 8-K filing which can be accessed on the Emmaus investor relations website at ir.emmausmedical.com.

Additionally, Emmaus has officially requested a hearing to appeal the previously announced determination of the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to delist the company's common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing, which is scheduled for September 5, 2019. In the event the appeal is unsuccessful, Emmaus common stock is expected to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Market.

""Our recent merger was a great step toward solidifying our balance sheet and providing us with greater access to the capital markets, which can help fund Emmaus' growth strategy as well as potential future acquisitions or other strategic transactions,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We strongly believe that Emmaus is on the right trajectory to achieve its mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies. The merger was one of the catalysts for Emmaus' improved financial position, putting us in a great place to move the company forward.""

Taps SB360 As Exclusive Consultant To Conduct Store Closing Sales In The Last Remaining 81 Fred's Stores,"BOSTON, Sept. 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fred's Inc., a discount value retailer, has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners as their exclusive consultant to conduct Store Closing Sales in all 81 remaining Fred's locations. SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

SB360 Capital Partners, LLC. A Schottenstein Affiliate (PRNewsfoto/SB360 Capital Partners) More

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Fred's Inc said on Monday it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, months after the pharmacy and discount retailer began shuttering hundreds of unprofitable stores in the United States, sending its shares down 44% before the bell.

Since the start of 2017, over 20 U.S. retailers, including Sears Holdings Corp and Toys 'R' Us, have filed for bankruptcy, succumbing to the onslaught of fierce e-commerce competition from Amazon Inc.

Fred's, which has been making losses since 2015, has been trying to turn around its business. In April, it said it would close at least 159 underperforming and unprofitable stores, or nearly 30% of its total outlets.

""Despite our team's best efforts, we were not able to avoid this outcome,"" Chief Executive Officer Joe Anto said.

The company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.

Fred's said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.

It has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.

Shares of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company, which have lost nearly all their value since the company was forced to scrap its bid for 1,200 Rite Aid Corp stores in June 2017, plunged to 15 cents in early trading.

On October 27, 2015, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens jointly announced an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9.00 per share in cash. To convince the investing public that it would receive FTC approval to complete the merger, Walgreens and Rite Aid had entered into an agreement with Fred's to sell 865 Rite Aid Corp stores for $950 million in an all-cash transaction in order to complete the Original Merger (the ""Fred's Asset Purchase Agreement""). On January 30, 2017, Rite Aid Corp and Walgreens announced that they had entered into a new merger agreement (the ""Revised Merger"").

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Relatives of the late Raymond Sackler hold a 54% stake in Peak Resorts Inc., which operates 17 ski areas including New York’s Hunter Mountain and Mount Snow in Vermont. Vail Resorts Inc. completed its acquisition of Peak on Tuesday, two months after the deal was announced.

The Sacklers own stock and warrants through Delaware-based Cap 1 LLC, which has held a stake since at least 2015, according to regulatory filings. Beneficiaries of the trust that owns Cap 1 include Raymond’s widow Beverly, son Richard and grandson David. They’re among the eight family members accused in state lawsuits of contributing to the nationwide public-health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans from overdoses.

It’s unclear how much profit the Sacklers reaped from the ski resort deal, because some stock purchases may not have been publicly disclosed. Vail is paying $11 a share for Peak Resorts, a 116% premium over its July 22 closing price. That would value the Sackler stake at $114 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg.

Davidson Goldin, a spokesman for portions of the Sackler family, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Purdue Bankruptcy

Heirs of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler gained notoriety over the past several years as the opioid crisis worsened. Their wealth is founded on drug company Purdue Pharma Inc., maker of the painkiller OxyContin.

Purdue filed for bankruptcy this month to settle claims that it pushed sales of the addictive drug. The Chapter 11 filing is designed to short-circuit more than 2,000 lawsuits against Purdue and the Sackler family by the states, cities and counties that have sued to recoup billion of dollars they spent battling opioid addictions and overdoses. Under a settlement proposal, the governments, hospitals and individuals suing Purdue would take ownership from the Sacklers, who have also agreed to pay at least $3 billion and to sell other assets. Such a deal would be expected to raise a total of more than $10 billion.

Opponents argue Purdue’s plan isn’t enough of a reckoning for the Sacklers, who made billions from the over-prescribing of OxyContin by doctors, spurred by the company’s marketing. The family got more than $4 billion from OxyContin sales from 2008 through 2015, court filings show.

The lawsuits describe a web of trusts, holding entities and investment vehicles comprising the Sackler fortune, including Summer Road LLC, a family office run by David A. Sackler that provides investment-management services to Cap 1.

Summer Road has also invested in hedge fund strategies and bought an office building in West Palm Beach, Florida, for $6.8 million, the Palm Beach Post reported last week. It also owned 8% of eye-care product developer Ocular Therapeutix Inc. and about 7% of Correvio Pharma Corp. as of June 30, according to its latest 13-F filing.

Purdue made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin and is widely blamed for fueling a nationwide crisis that has left more than 400,000 people dead from abuse of prescription opioids over the past two decades.

According to the filings obtained by the Post, members of the family are benefitting from the sale of 17 resorts in the Northeast and Midwest. The Sacklers, known for a complex network of business interests, had a stake in the company Peak Resorts Inc., which owned the ski areas, according to the Post.

Some of the winter resorts lie within the Catskills of New York and the vast hills of New Hampshire, Vermont and Pennsylvania -- places known to have battled the wave of opioid addiction.

Peak Resorts Inc. declined to comment on the matter.

The sale, finalized last week, comes just after Purdue filed for bankruptcy in New York following a tentative settlement with many state and local governments suing it over the toll of opioids.

Representatives for Purdue Pharma didn't mmediately respond to request for comment from FOX Business.

The plan calls for turning Purdue into a “public benefit trust” that would continue selling preecription opioids but use its profits for lawsuit settlements. The Sackler family would give up control of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.

The ""framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,” Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue’s board of directors, said in a statement, “and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis.”

Two dozen states have signed on to the settlement plan along with lawyers who represent many of the 2,000-plus local governments suing the company.

But legal battles still lie ahead for Purdue, which did not admit to any wrongdoing. Several states plan to object to the settlement in bankruptcy court and to continue litigation in other courts against members of the Sackler family. They argue the family has funneled a fortune from the firm into shell companies and Swiss bank accounts, and is getting off too easily

A court filing by the New York Attorney General's Office earlier this month contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves.

The Sacklers are simply ""throwing the carcass of this drug company into bankruptcy,” said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, whose state plans to join Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York in pursuing the company.

Since OxyContin was introduced in 1996, addiction and overdoses have surged. In both 2017 and 2018, opioids were involved in more than 47,000 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Associated Press and FOX Business' Ken Martin contributed to this article.

While Wall Street groaned over the struggles of Uber Technologies, Inc., Lyft, Inc., and WeWork parent The We Company in recent months, a cousin of the traditional IPO has flourished, often delivering a healthy exit for private owners and strong aftermarket trading for public shareholders. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are on course to break records in 2019 both in terms of fundraising and target companies acquired. The structure, which allows a sponsor to raise cash in a new listed vehicle and bring a private company public through M&A, has been around since the 1990s but evolved dramatically since. What have been the key features behind successful deals? What elements of the structure are likely to change? And are there limits on the size and variety of deals going forward?

These were some of the questions addressed at SPAC in Action!, IPO Edge’s first SPAC-focused roundtable featuring four leading experts who are all active players in the field. The participants included Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP; Phil Denning, Partner at communications and advisory firm ICR Inc.; Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds; and Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II.

Mr. Smith, who has advised clients on notable deals including WillScot Corporation and Limbach Holdings, stressed that successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. He also believes that the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets and that SPACs that are too large can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. He ultimately believes that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges.

As an institutional investor in recent deals such as at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited and payments company Repay Holdings Corporation, Mr. Greenberg noted that SPACs offer distinct advantages over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg said he was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Story continues

Mr. Heyer brings perspective as both the CEO of two recent SPACs and a veteran business executive with decades of experience. He believes that SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. Mr. Heyer’s latest deal was to bring OneSpaWorld public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target.

Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group, said that SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs.

The complete interviews with each of the four roundtable participants can be found below.





Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP

Successful SPACs need transaction advisors with SPAC deal-making experience. Often the best acquisition targets are growth companies rather than distressed assets. And while some SPAC IPOs have approached a billion dollars, huge SPACs can encounter challenges in finding a viable target that’s appropriate in size. That’s according to Elliott Smith, Partner at Winston & Strawn LLP, which has advised clients in SPAC transactions including New Frontier Corporation, Netfin Acquisition Corp., WillScot Corporation, Target Hospitality, and Limbach Holdings. Mr. Smith also says that SPACs can be a faster, cheaper, and easier avenue to becoming a public company than traditional IPOs, but also face their own unique challenges. The full interview is below.

Elliott M. Smith focuses his practice on corporate and securities law. Elliott advises clients on a wide variety of capital markets transactional matters, including IPOs, follow-on offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities. Elliott has particular experience representing SPACs and their sponsor teams in IPOs and back-end business combinations. Elliott also advises public company clients on corporate governance matters and compliance with the federal securities laws.

IPO Edge: How has the warrant feature on SPACs evolved and where do you see it going?

Mr. Smith: Way back in the 1990s, SPACs issued units consisting of one share and two warrants, one of which was struck in-the-money, meaning the strike price was below the per-unit IPO price. The in-the-money warrant functioned like an immediate capital raise following the closing of a business combination, but created a lot of dilution to stockholders which put pressure on the stock price. In the 2000s, SPAC IPO units evolved to typically include one in-the-money warrant. Towards the end of that cycle, around 2008, SPACs starting issuing units with one share and one warrant which was struck out-of-the-money.

These days, SPACs issue units in their IPO for $10.00, and the units include a share and a warrant (or a fraction of warrant). The warrants have an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Some repeat sponsor teams or sponsors affiliated with well-known private equity funds are able to leverage their deal-making track record in order to reduce the number of warrants issued as part of the units to one-half or even one-third of a warrant. By reducing the warrant coverage (i.e., the number of shares issuable upon exercise of all the warrants), these sponsors can market their SPACs as more attractive vehicles to target companies and investors as compared to other SPACs that have more warrants outstanding, since the former represent less potential dilution to stockholders upon completion of the business combination.

The warrants are a necessary sweetener in order to bring investors into a SPAC’s IPO, but can be unattractive to potential investors in the stock later on after a business combination because of the overhang. Over the years SPACs have tried to mitigate this by eliminating or ‘cleaning up’ the warrants at the time of the business combination or shortly thereafter, usually through amendments to the warrant agreement that effectively convert the warrants into cash and/or shares. In terms of the future, warrants will likely always be part of a SPAC’s IPO units in one form or another, and I don’t see SPAC units including less than one-third of a warrant anytime soon.

IPO Edge: How do you convince investors to take fewer warrants with their IPO shares?

Mr. Smith: It’s really a function of investors’ regard for the quality of the sponsor team and their track record and the investors’ perception of their ability to find a good target business and complete a business combination. Top-tier sponsor teams that generate a lot of investor interest in their IPOs can offer less favorable terms (i.e., less warrants). First-time sponsor teams rarely can get away with including less than a full warrant in their SPAC units. And when the market slows down, even repeat sponsors will sweeten their IPOs with additional warrant coverage in order to get the IPO sold.

IPO Edge: What are the key ingredients in getting a SPAC IPO to work?

Mr. Smith: Frankly, in recent years we’ve seen a lot of first-time sponsor teams able to complete IPOs, which makes it look like it’s not too difficult to raise a SPAC if the sponsors are willing to provide favorable terms to IPO investors, such as overfunding the trust account or providing significant warrant coverage.

That said, we have seen some IPOs downsize or get pulled due to investor skepticism of teams that come in to SPACs who have not been involved in public deals or growth equity transactions before, like distressed asset investors, or even successful executives who want to do a SPAC because they like the look of the potential returns but don’t have much of a track record for deal making. The SPAC product is really best suited to growth equity stories where the right combination of a savvy sponsor and a solid target business generate investor interest. Distressed assets and value transactions have generally not fared so well with SPACs.

IPO Edge: Some SPACs have recently raised several hundred million dollars in their IPOs. Can they keep growing? What are the remaining issues?

Mr. Smith: In the past few years the size of SPAC IPOs has increased, in some instances to nearly a billion dollars. But oddly enough there are challenges with big SPACs. Generally, in order to mitigate the dilution from the founder shares and warrants, a target business should be 3-4x the value of the SPAC’s trust account. Finding a target business with valuation of $2+ billion can be challenging for SPACs. Companies that size often don’t need some of the things a SPAC offers and can just go do a traditional IPO if desired. So the pool of target companies can be smaller for big SPACs and we’ve had some sponsor teams ask whether it’s possible to reduce a SPAC’s size after the IPO, which is not really possible. As a result, depending on the industry in which a SPAC is focused, we see repeat sponsors opting to raise SPACs in the $200-$400 million range for maximum flexibility to look for a target 3-4x its size, or sometimes larger. If needed, SPACs can scale up for larger deals by raising additional capital at the time of the business combination.

IPO Edge: What kind of advantages do combinations with SPACs have over traditional IPOs?

Mr. Smith: It can be faster, easier, and often cheaper to go public through a SPAC than a traditional IPO. The traditional IPO process typically takes 9-18 months. A SPAC business combination can get done in four months.

With SPACs, there’s greater flexibility regarding deal structuring, marketing materials and communications with investors. Target sellers can take more cash off the table than is otherwise possible in a traditional IPO. SPAC marketing materials can include projections, which is rare for IPOs. There is also flexibility on timing. In an IPO, if the market is not there, the deal often will need to be pulled and the company is back to square one. With SPACs, the transaction terms can be re-cut to be more favorable to investors, additional capital can be brought in through a PIPE or debt financing if needed, and these changes can be made in real time during the marketing process right up until the closing. In an IPO, those kinds of changes would need to be pushed through a Form S-1 and would likely delay the SEC review process, so that’s another advantage for SPACs.

One potential downside of all that flexibility with SPACs is that sponsors and targets can get deals done even if the transaction is not well received by the market. That can lead to real challenges for the post-closing company. If too many public investors redeem at the time of the business combination, the stock will be thinly traded which can make it hard to raise additional capital. It can be challenging for post-SPAC companies to attract institutions to invest in the secondary market if there is low trading volume in the company’s stock.

Another thing to remember is that with a traditional IPO, the Company is typically selling a minority stake in the company to the public, so the potential to be oversubscribed can be higher. In a traditional IPO, the offering size can be calibrated to investor demand and the underwriters can ensure there is healthy aftermarket trading in the stock. With a SPAC, particularly the large ones, sponsors have to turn over all the outstanding stock of the SPAC, which can soak up all the demand in the market make for choppy trading following the closing.

IPO Edge: What about limitations on SPACs and can they be improved?

Mr. Smith: The product itself is inherently flexible to accommodate all types of transactions. It’s really about the sponsor team and the kind of target business that they bring to the market. If a SPAC doesn’t bring a good target business to its shareholders, then it doesn’t matter what the warrant coverage is or if the founders are giving up some of their founder shares, public stockholders will redeem their shares and the stock price is going to suffer. On the other hand, we’ve seen SPACs that have a full warrant do a deal that is well received and they are able to withstand the overhang issue and create value for investors post-closing. So it’s really a function of the quality of the transaction, as well as the target management team’s ability to execute on its growth plan.

That said, there are headwinds for SPACs. One is perception. People continue to view SPACs as high risk. Unfortunately, there are several examples of deals that have gone south after closing, or people remember 2008 when several SPACs liquidated with no deal. Unfortunately, with each business combination that gets done and the stock price tanks, it’s a ding on the SPAC product, which isn’t really right but it’s about the perception.

Some think that SPACs have a tendency to overpay when time is running out for them and they need to find a deal. There’s probably some truth to that, but again, if a sponsor team and target company’s sellers understand the product and the process and are focused on positioning the company to perform post-closing, then I think those negative factors can be overcome.

Lastly, we’ve heard some sponsors lament that their banks don’t ‘show up’ for them to market the business combination with the same energy compared to a traditional IPO. That may be because of how the deferred underwriting fee gets allocated within the bank, and so there probably is room for improvement there that would help back-end deals get executed successfully.





Cliff Greenberg, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds

SPACs can offer distinct advantages to institutional investors over traditional IPOs, including the ability to take a larger position early on at a reasonable price. That’s according to Cliff Greenberg, SVP and Portfolio Manager at Baron Funds, which has invested in a number of recent SPAC companies including at-sea spa operator OneSpaWorld (ticker: OSW) and payments company Repay Holdings (ticker: RPAY). Baron has played an especially active role in SPAC deals, recently investing in a private placement alongside the SPAC transaction that took Repay Holdings public. Mr. Greenberg was supportive of the private placement because it helped the company reduce leverage and buy out a portion of the outstanding warrants, greatly reducing potential dilution. He notes that the amount of warrants attached to SPAC IPOs continues to fall as sponsors gain credibility and initial buyers don’t need as much incentive to invest.

Cliff Greenberg is the Portfolio Manager of Baron Small Cap Fund. He invests in small-sized U.S. companies with significant growth potential. Investments include fallen angels with strong long-term franchises that have disappointed investors, and special situations where lack of investor awareness creates opportunities. Mr. Greenberg has 35 years of investing experience, including 22 years at Baron Funds.

IPO Edge: Your fund was instrumental in the process of Repay going public through a SPAC, with Baron Funds participating in a private placement that helped extinguish 75% of the warrants in the deal. How did you view that situation?

Mr. Greenberg: Repay had enough money to close the deal, but we advised them to take a little more to immediately buy the warrants. The warrants were dilutive and added confusion to the capital structure. We also preferred that they run with a little less leverage and have more capital to pursue accretive acquisitions.

IPO Edge: SPACs have been raising larger and larger amounts of money. What’s your view on investing in a SPAC at the time of IPO?

Mr. Greenberg: I don’t like to invest in blind pools. I invest in companies, so my approach is to wait until the SPAC identifies a target and then decide.

Sometimes, I’ll put more money in if they need it like I did with Repay. In other cases, I’ll just go out and buy SPAC shares in the market as we did with Clarivate.

IPO Edge: What do you like about SPACs compared with IPOs?

Mr. Greenberg: I can get size with a SPAC. In a regular IPO, I may get $5 million or $10 million in the allocation. But then the stock may jump, and I won’t want to buy any more since it’s too expensive. You’re often not able to establish a full position at a reasonable price.

A big advantage with a SPAC is that I can invest more capital upfront at what I believe is a reasonable price.

Another advantage is there is more disclosure and more time to do due diligence. You can learn more about a SPAC’s acquisition target, see projections, and communicate with management. I take advantage of the ability to meet these companies and get to know them well before investing.

IPO Edge: What’s contributed to the success of SPACs over time?

Mr. Greenberg: There has been an evolution. These used to be $20, $50, $100 million raises. They were acquiring flaky companies and there was a big risk that the deal wouldn’t get approved. Also excess compensation was going to sponsors who didn’t play a role in the acquired companies.

Now, you have $300, $400, $500 million raised. The sponsors are playing a very significant role in the future of the company and are more reasonably compensated for their role.

IPO Edge: Getting back to the Repay deal, what role do you think warrants will play going forward?

Mr. Greenberg: Warrants complicate financial structures and are dilutive. There used to be two warrants issued per share, then one. You’ve had deals done with less than one warrant and there are some in the market now with a quarter of a warrant, which is a favorable development for new long-term investors.

Investors aren’t demanding as many goodies upfront as they were in the past. Institutional buyers don’t need as much incentive.

It’s a positive that Repay was able to retire a good portion of the warrants that were issued upon approval of the deal. I believe this will be emulated going forward and is a major positive.

Steven Heyer, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II

SPAC IPOs are getting larger and there is scope for a broader range of acquisition targets, but it will remain critical to have a top-notch operator, a financial expert and a business plan that doesn’t depend on too many promises. That’s according to Steven Heyer, a veteran business executive who brought OneSpaWorld Holdings (ticker: OSW) public as CEO of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. The health and wellness company, which operates spas aboard major cruise lines such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean, has been one of the most successful SPAC combinations in recent years, with the shares trading nearly 70% higher (and more for those who kept warrants) since the merger was announced. Steven Heyer and his brother Andrew Heyer, who was President of Haymaker, have subsequently raised $400 million for Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, which is currently searching for another acquisition target. The full interview is below.

Steven Heyer is Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II. He is also lead director of OneSpaWorld Holdings and serves as a director of Lazard Ltd and Lazard Group. Mr. Heyer has over 40 years of experience in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries leading a range of companies and brands. He has applied his leadership and analytical skills in a variety of leadership positions across diverse industry groups, including broadcast media, consumer products, along with hotel and leisure companies. Mr. Heyer was the Chief Executive Officer of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and President and Chief Operating Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. He also was President and Chief Operating Officer of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., and a member of AOL Time Warner’s Operating Committee. Among other roles, he is an advisor and director to, and investor in, several private companies, including startups and turnarounds.

IPO Edge: What type of leadership qualities are most important in a successful SPAC?

Mr. Heyer: The most successful SPACs should have a mix of an operator who can see the potential in a business and someone with the financial mind needed to craft a deal. I really enjoyed working with Andy on Haymaker and we’re doing the same thing with Haymaker II. I’ve come to love him even more.

IPO Edge: What kind of company makes a good SPAC target?

Mr. Heyer: You look for a good business that has both growth and free cash flow. It should be differentiated from the rest of the market with a wide moat around the business. OneSpaWorld has all of those features and we were able to get a deal done with a fabulous company. We had almost no redemptions and great enthusiasm for the transaction.

IPO Edge: What are the reasons to do a SPAC versus a traditional IPO?

Mr. Heyer: If the owner wants to take significant money off the table immediately, a SPAC is better. It’s also an opportunity for the owner to roll some of the investment to participate in the upside of a well-performing stock.

However, for a SPAC to succeed, you need trust and motivation on both sides. That’s how we got a friendly, fast negotiation with OneSpaWorld.

IPO Edge: Is there a size limitation for SPAC IPOs? What’s helping them get bigger?

Mr. Heyer: We raised $400 million for Haymaker II but it could be a billion dollars. The issue is that you’re probably looking for a middle market deal, so you don’t need that much in the SPAC IPO. You’re not going to raise $5 billion.

With a more successful track record, you can attract investors who want to bet on your team before the target is known.

IPO Edge: How have SPACs been perceived over the years?

Mr. Heyer: If you go back 20 years, SPAC was a dirty word. The reason is that people were using them to line their pockets. They were being bad stewards. Even recently, we had a handful of investors who had a knee-jerk negative reaction to a SPAC because of that history. But with more successful deals, attitudes are changing. It’s evolved from being a niche vehicle to becoming a real asset class.

IPO Edge: You talked about cash flow. Could a SPAC deal be done with a fast-growing company that’s not yet profitable?

Mr. Heyer: I would do it if the growth story were compelling enough and the potential for meaningful profit creation was clear. The expectation needs to be that the business can float on its own and doesn’t hinge on a dozen promises or flawless integration. At some point it stretches credibility.

Phil Denning, Partner, ICR Inc.

SPAC deals are likely to expand into new industries such as real estate but there may be a limit on how large any transaction can get. That’s according to Phil Denning, Partner and Co-Head of ICR’s special situations group. ICR has advised on dozens of SPAC transactions, including OneSpaWorld (Haymaker Acquisition Corp.), Repay Holdings (Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.), and Simply Good Foods Company (Conyers Park Acquisition Corp). Mr. Denning attributed much of the recent success in SPACs to the presence of well-regarded private equity firms that remained shareholders after deals closed and took board seats to stay on as advisors. He also pointed out that SPACs benefit from regulations that allow companies to communicate very clearly with investors, giving guidance for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda – something that’s not allowed with traditional IPOs. The full interview is below:

IPO Edge: What has been the main driver of the success of SPACs in the last several months?

Mr. Denning: One key feature of many successful deals has been the presence of a well-regarded private equity firm that has elected to keep a significant stake in the company after it goes public. It not only sends the message that the private equity firm believes in the business, but can be helpful as the company plots its strategy moving forward. We saw that with both OneSpaWorld, which has L Catterton as a shareholder and Repay, which has Corsair Capital as a shareholder. The role of the private equity firm is generally to advise in the form of one or more board directors. But you can also go with informal advisory roles or even more formal – such as an executive position created.

There has also been an element of creativity in recent deals that made them succeed. The Repay deal would have closed without the PIPE investors, but their additional capital made the terms even better because of the dilution that was eliminated. I think that the flexible nature of the product has fostered creative thinking, which has led to success.

IPO Edge: Warrant “coverage” has decreased in many recent deals – with some as low as ¼ per share. Do you believe that the warrant feature is likely to keep shrinking or do some deals need them?

Mr. Denning: The warrant can be a great incentive to get investors into a SPAC IPO, especially with a team that has a lot of potential but not a proven track record. There are investors out there who really just buy into a deal to get the warrant and have no intention of keeping the shares, and that’s fine – because it helps get the cash raised. But the idea is to attract investors who believe enough in a management team that they want to stick with the SPAC shares and wind up owning the target company.

You will probably always need some warrant feature to keep investors incentivized. After all, if you’re going to let your cash sit in a trust account and just earn minimal interest, you need a carrot.

There will be deals with very small fractions of a warrant. Those are going to be the SPACs whose leadership have very strong track records. For those newer to the game, a full warrant per share is probably going to remain the norm.

IPO Edge: Do you expect SPACs to get even larger in the next few years?

Mr. Denning: I actually think that SPACs under a billion dollars are the ideal size. If you get much bigger the company is probably best suited to go the typical IPO route.

The reason why SPACs may do so well at the current size is that there’s plethora of middle-market target companies owned by private equity. Many of those private equity firms are in a difficult position because the companies aren’t an ideal fit for an IPO, meaning they can only rally be sold to a strategic or another private equity firm. So SPACs have created an entirely new exit path.

And SPACs are more appealing than a straight sale because many private equity owners want to participate in further upside. If you sell the company to another firm, you obviously can’t do that.

IPO Edge: What are the key advantages to going public via a SPAC rather than a traditional IPO?

Mr. Denning: One major advantage I have observed relates to disclosure. With a SPAC, it’s relatively easy to communicate a target company’s growth plans once the deal is announced. You’re able to show the investment community specific targets for metrics such as revenue and Ebitda that you can’t with a traditional IPO. That takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for potential investors.

Another advantage from the perspective of a company owner is the ability to sell a large stake but also remain a significant holder. With an IPO, you’re really only selling a sliver of the company at the time of the deal.

SPACs can also happen much more quickly. If you raise money and find a target right away, a deal can be done in a matter of months. The IPO process is much more long and arduous.

IPO Edge: Are there specific industries that are best suited for SPACs?

Mr. Denning: There has been a lot of success with consumer and consumer-related deals, looking back to Hostess Brands and more recently to OneSpaWorld. But I think there is plenty of scope to grow in different industries. Just recently we had a real-estate SPAC deal announced with Broadmark, which is merging with Trinity Merger Corp. (ticker: TMCX). I would expect sponsors to get more creative as we see successful deals done in new industries.

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.'

With a market capitalization of US$635m, Repay Holdings is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about RPAY.

NasdaqCM:RPAY Ownership Summary, August 9th 2019 More

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Repay Holdings?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that Repay Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold 23% of the stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Repay Holdings's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

NasdaqCM:RPAY Income Statement, August 9th 2019 More

It would appear that 3.7% of Repay Holdings shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Repay Holdings

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Forms Joint Venture with Grupo CLISA to Invest in LNG and CNG Assets

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / August 21, 2019 / Stabilis Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLNG) (“Stabilis”) today announced two strategic transactions that will expand its presence in the distributed liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) markets in Mexico. Stabilis has completed the acquisition of privately held Diversenergy, LLC (“Diversenergy”) and its subsidiaries to create one of the leading distributed LNG marketing and distribution companies in Mexico. In addition, Stabilis has completed the formation of a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) with Grupo CLISA and other former owners of Diversenergy to pursue investments in LNG and CNG assets in Mexico.

Diversenergy Acquisition

As one of the leading providers of LNG marketing and distribution services in Mexico, Diversenergy provides LNG to customers that use LNG as a fuel in mobile high horsepower applications and to customers that do not have natural gas pipeline access. As a result of the acquisition, Diversenergy and its Mexican subsidiary have become wholly owned subsidiaries of Stabilis. The transaction was structured as an equity purchase with Diversenergy’s owners receiving cash and Stabilis common stock consideration. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Lee Kellough, former CEO of Diversenergy, will serve as President of Stabilis’ Mexican subsidiary (Diversenergy S.A.P.I. de C.V.) and Senior Vice President of Stabilis.

“Stabilis is pleased to announce the acquisition of Diversenergy,” said Jim Reddinger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stabilis. “We see significant growth opportunities in the large and expanding market for LNG and CNG fuel in Mexico. We welcome Diversenergy to the Stabilis team and look forward to working together to bring clean, low cost, and abundant natural gas to our customers in Mexico.”

Lee Kellough added, “We are confident that this transaction creates a solid platform for Stabilis to become a leader in the LNG and CNG markets in Mexico. We believe that we have the right combination of people, equipment, and relationships to capitalize on the substantial growth opportunities we see throughout Mexico.”

Joint Venture Formed for Investment in LNG and CNG Assets in Mexico

In addition, Stabilis has formed a joint venture with CryoMex Investment Group LLC (“CryoMex”) to pursue investments in distributed natural gas production and distribution assets in Mexico. CryoMex is led by Grupo CLISA, a Monterrey, Mexico-based developer and operator of businesses in multiple end markets including energy.

The Joint Venture, operating as Energía Superior Gas Natural LLC, plans to invest in LNG and CNG production, transportation, storage, and regasification assets that serve multiple end markets throughout Mexico, including the industrial, mining, pipeline, utility, marine, and over-the-road transportation markets.

“Stabilis couldn’t ask for better partners than Grupo CLISA,” said Jim Reddinger. “Their existing partnerships with international companies to build and operate assets in Mexico demonstrate their ability to execute effectively and with integrity. We look forward to building a great distributed natural gas business in Mexico with our new partners.”

Gerardo Cavazos, Chief Executive Officer of Grupo CLISA added, “We share Stabilis’ view that there is vast potential for distributed natural gas solutions throughout Mexico and we believe that together we will be able to help build that market.”

The Joint Venture plans to begin immediately evaluating LNG and CNG asset development opportunities throughout Mexico, including in the Monterrey, Sonora, and Mexico City regions. These assets could include LNG liquefaction facilities, cryogenic rolling stock equipment, CNG compression stations, and pressurized rolling stock equipment, among others.

Thompson & Knight LLP acted as legal advisor to Stabilis. Jones Day LLP acted as legal advisor to Diversenergy and its owners.

Investor Call

Stabilis has scheduled an investor update call on Thursday August 22, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss this transaction. Individuals in the United States and Canada who wish to participate in the conference call should dial +1 844-602-0380. International callers should dial +1 862-298-0970.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.



About Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. is a clinical stage oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. Its current pipeline mainly consists of 3 drug candidates; Xynomic owns global exclusive development, manufacturing and commercialization rights to each of these. Its lead drug candidate, abexinostat, is in global potentially pivotal clinical trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (in combination with pazopanib) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (as a single agent). Xynomic’s other clinical stage drug candidate XP-105 (BI 860585) is a Phase 2 ready, ATP-competitive mTORC1/2 inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors. Xynomic’s pre-clinical oncology drug candidate XP-102 (BI 882370) is a pan-RAF inhibitor.

We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

View our latest analysis for Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

Does Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 69% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Do The Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?

The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings. Nice! Along with insider transactions, I recommend checking if Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is growing revenue. This free chart of historic revenue and earnings should make that easy.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (NASDAQ:YRIV).

What Is Insider Selling?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

See our latest analysis for Yangtze River Port and Logistics

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Yangtze River Port and Logistics

Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Director, James Coleman, for US$402k worth of shares, at about US$1.14 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$0.89. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. The only individual insider seller over the last year was James Coleman.

James Coleman divested 513k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$1.05. The chart below shows insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Does Yangtze River Port and Logistics Boast High Insider Ownership?

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Yangtze River Port and Logistics insiders own about US$104m worth of shares (which is 68% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Yangtze River Port and Logistics Insiders?

An insider hasn't bought Yangtze River Port and Logistics stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP (“Scott+Scott”), an international securities and consumer rights litigation firm, is investigating whether certain directors and officers of Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (“Yangtze” or the “Company”) (YRIV) breached their fiduciary duties to Yangtze and its shareholders. If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may contact attorney Joe Pettigrew for additional information: 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

Scott+Scott is investigating whether members of Yangtze’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts, about Yangtze’s business, operations, prospects, and financial health. Specifically, Scott+Scott is investigating whether the Board failed to disclose material information, including whether: (1) Yangtze’s purported lease of Wuhan Newport, the Company’s main asset, was a fabrication; (2) Yangtze’s only operating subsidiary, Wuhan Newport, was declared insolvent in China due to a number of default judgments against it; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

On August 27, 2018, Barron’s published, “A Troubled Chinese Company Is Seeking a Lifeline From U.S. Investors,” revealing that Wuhan Newport was “showing up on official websites in which Chinese courts list debtors with unpaid legal judgments.” On this news, Yangtze stock fell $0.11 per share, or almost 1%, to close at $11.53 on August 27, 2018.

On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report, entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated,” which caused Yangtze stock to fall $3.34 per share – over 28% – over the next two trading days to close at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

If you are a Yangtze shareholder, you may have legal claims against Yangtze’s directors and officers. If you wish to discuss this investigation, or have questions about this notice or your legal rights, please contact attorney Joe Pettigrew toll-free at 844-818-6982 or jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.

LD Micro has always held the belief that our industry needs a truly accurate indicator of what is occurring in the micro-cap world.

With this reconstitution the index will contain 984 companies, a surprisingly similar number to what we had back in February. Nearly as many companies have “graduated” out of the index as those that have “graduated” in.

Performance since the close of January 31st, 2019:

Nasdaq: +12% (Very nice)

S&P500: +10.2% (Solid)

Dow Jones: +7.5% (Respectable)

Russell 2000: +5% (Better than CDs)

LD Micro Index: -2.8% (The night is still young)

A breakdown by exchange, sector, and complete constituent list is available at our website: http://www.ldmicro.com/the-index.

Chris Lahiji, President of LD Micro, stated ""As we turn four, more people in our industry are using the Index as an additional indicator for what is taking place on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Our goal has always been to add much needed insight to the space, and based on the dichotomy between micro, small, and large-cap, we feel our index provides the most accurate picture of micro-cap as a whole. As evidenced, micro-cap performance thus far in 2019 has been incredibly disconcerting.”

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa Resources” or the “Company”) today announced that, on September 13, 2019, it received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2019 (the “Filing”), and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. This determination is based on the Filing and associated public interest concerns raised by it, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about the Company’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. Given the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and the Company’s pending Chapter 11 cases, the Company does not plan to appeal the Nasdaq determination to delist the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, trading of the Company’s common stock and warrants will be suspended at the opening of business on September 24, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company expects the common stock and warrants to be traded over-the-counter under the symbol “AMRQ” and “AMRWWQ” and expects to continue filing its annual, quarterly and current reports in accordance with the requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(AMR)","""Since 2006, value stocks (IVE vs IVW) have underperformed 11 of the 13 calendar years and when they beat growth, it wasn't by much. Cumulatively, through this week, it has been a 122% differential (up 52% for value vs up 174% for growth). This appears to be the longest and most severe drought for value investors since data collection began. It will go our way eventually as there are too many people paying far too much for today's darlings, both public and private. Further, the ten-year yield of 2.5% (pre-tax) isn't attractive nor is real estate. We believe the value part of the global equity market is the only place to earn solid risk adjusted returns and we believe those returns will be higher than normal,"" said Vilas Fund in its Q1 investor letter. We aren't sure whether value stocks outperform growth, but we follow hedge fund investor letters to understand where the markets and stocks might be going. This article will lay out and discuss the hedge fund and institutional investor sentiment towards Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR).

Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMR) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. AMR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 19 hedge funds in our database with AMR positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that amr isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 30.9% through May 30, 2019. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

The notification also stated that the Company would be provided 180 calendar days, or until February 11, 2020, to regain compliance with the foregoing listing requirement. To do so, the bid price of the Company's common stock must close at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to that date.

If the Company does not regain compliance by the compliance deadline, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to remedy the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq staff will inform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the Nasdaq staff that the Company will not be able to remedy the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, the staff will provide notice that its securities will be subject to delisting. The Company cannot provide any assurance that its common shares will trade at levels necessary to regain and maintain compliance with the above-referenced bid price rule before the compliance deadline. The Company intends to continue to monitor the bid price for its common stock. If the Company's common shares do not trade at a level that is likely to regain compliance with the Nasdaq requirements, the Company's Board of Directors will consider alternative options that may be available to achieve compliance.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced in a recent Form 6-K report that on September 4, 2019, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company stating that The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market.



The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting. Additionally, as of the date of this release, the Company continues to make progress with the completion of its delinquent annual report and intends to file these reports with the SEC. The Company intends to complete and file its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as soon as possible with the SEC. Thereafter, the Company intends to work with a market maker to file a Form 211 with FINRA to enable the Company’s shares to begin trading on the over-the-counter markets.

“While there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to execute its plan. If the shares resume trading on the over-the-counter markets, the shares may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on Nasdaq. While trading on the over-the-counter-markets the Company expects to apply for a Nasdaq listing at a future time.” concluded Mr. Liu.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced that a special committee comprised of independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”) has concluded the fact-finding portion of an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Song Wang (“Mr. Wang”), and allegations of enterprise bribery involving the Company that date back to 2014.



The Special Committee retained the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP to assist in conducting this investigation. While the Special Committee identified potential concerns relating to certain Company transactions that may indicate that improper payments were made in connection with the 2014 transaction at issue, it did not identify direct evidence indicating that Mr. Wang or any member of Company Management or the Board of Directors (the “Board”) engaged in or approved of any improper payment. It should be noted that the Special Committee’s investigation was constrained to some extent by the passage of time, significant turnover in Company personnel since 2014 and the lack of direct access to Mr. Wang. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Committee did identify weaknesses in the Company’s compliance program and recommended several improvements, including the addition of resources for compliance and internal audit functions and enhanced training. The Board has approved the adoption of all of these recommendations and the Company has begun implementing them.

The Board also accepted the resignation of two senior managers (including one who was also a director of the Company), who did not notify the Board of the arrest of Mr. Wang until May 16, 2019. It is the understanding of the Special Committee that during the absence of Mr. Wang, from around January 16, 2019 until May 16, 2019, the Company’s operations were managed by other members of the Company’s management team, including a member thereof who exercised certain management authority under power of attorney granted by Mr. Wang prior to his detention.

To enhance its commitment to stringent corporate governance standards, the Board was recently reconstituted by appointing three new directors. The reconstituted Board consists of two independent directors and two executive directors. The Chairman of the Board and all members of the audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance committees are independent. In addition, the management of the Company is currently led by Mr. Bin Liu, the acting chief executive officer, who was appointed to replace Mr. Wang on May 17, 2019. The Company intends to add a third independent director to the Board in the near term to ensure that there are three independent directors on the audit committee and that a majority of the directors on the Board are independent, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules.

L Catterton Enters Into Definitive Agreement to Sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille to Landry's, Inc.

IRVING, Texas and GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Del Frisco's"") and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced the completion of the transaction under which L Catterton has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Del Frisco's for approximately $650 million. As a result of the transaction's close, Del Frisco's stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In conjunction with closing, L Catterton has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille assets to Landry's, Inc. (""Landry's"") for an undisclosed consideration. The transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""We are confident that the separation of the business and the sale of the steak concepts to Landry's creates the best opportunity to unlock value in all of the Company's restaurant brands,"" said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. ""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Mr. Taub added, ""We look forward to leveraging L Catterton's deep restaurant experience and operational capabilities to help bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar reach their full potential. We are confident that running as separate businesses, these highly experiential and unique restaurant concepts will be best positioned for growth and expansion.""

L Catterton was advised by Credit Suisse, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

IRVING, Texas, June 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions.

The billionaire owner of casinos, restaurants and the NBA’s Houston Rockets had coveted Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group Inc. since 2012. This summer it looked improbable that his Landry’s Inc. restaurant group would get a shot. Private equity firm L Catterton had struck a deal to acquire the high-end chain in June and, as recently as Tuesday, bankers were busy trying to sell debt to fund the transaction.

But, in a surprise twist, Fertitta popped up to snare the coveted steakhouses.

L Catterton completed its $650 million purchase Wednesday, but immediately announced it was selling Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouses and Del Frisco’s Grilles to Landry’s for an undisclosed sum. The buyout firm will keep bartaco, a purveyor of tacos and tequila, and Barcelona Wine Bar brands.

“It’s something that I’ve looked at for years and sometimes you just have to wait for the deal to come back to you,” Fertitta, 62, said in a phone interview.

Del Frisco’s operates more than 35 restaurants, including Del Frisco’s Double Eagle in Midtown Manhattan, a favorite with the finance crowd, offering its signature 45-day dry-aged double-bone prime ribeye for $140 and a tasting of three wagyu steaks at $205.

It also has locations in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, and one in Washington that caters to lobbyists and politicians. On the night of the deal, a sign indicated that Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was there.

Despite the chain’s popularity with Wall Street, bankers labored to sell $425 million of debt to fund L Catterton’s buyout. Credit Suisse Group AG offered an all-in yield of 9.6%, people familiar with the matter said this month. But with concerns growing about the effects a potential recession may have on a cyclical business, especially expensive steakhouses and wine bars, some investors remained skeptical.

A spokeswoman for L Catterton declined to comment.

Fertitta, who’s worth $3.9 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, also said he couldn’t comment on why L Catterton sold the assets, but he’s a big believer in steak.

The Houston businessman already owns nine steakhouse chains, including Morton’s and Mastro’s. He even opened a female-focused one with actress Eva Longoria in 2013 that’s now closed. Fertitta said he’s willing to put more equity into the Del Frisco’s business and isn’t concerned about the long-term prospects, including the threat from meat substitutes.

“I’ll do whatever I need to do,” said Fertitta, who’s also the chairman and chief executive officer of Fertitta Entertainment, which operates the Golden Nugget casinos. “Steak’s always gonna be the most popular food in the world.”

Fertitta may see a challenge from meat substitutes as consumers flock to restaurants for plant-based burgers from Beyond Meat Inc. and Impossible Foods Inc. Fertitta said the hype of meatless burgers is overblown and that consumers will return to red meat once they realize the products aren’t as healthy as they’re made out to be.

Still, he’s open to serving the trendy plant-based product “if the customers want them,” he said.

Fertitta, who counts Jefferies Financial Group Inc. head Richard Handler as a close friend, used the bank as Landry’s lead adviser on the deal, along with Deutsche Bank Securities and North Point Advisors.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies include constipation, nausea, headache, and abdominal pain.

Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation included one case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment, today released the following summary review of the clinical trials and efficacy findings for Endari®.

""In light of our decision to withdraw our marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine), there is some confusion relating to the previous clinical trials and efficacy findings that led to Endari's approval by the FDA in 2017,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following summary to our shareholders and the SCD community.""

Endari Clinical Trial Results

The data supporting Endari® is straightforward, and the clinical trials leading to the therapeutic's approval by the FDA were a resounding success. The Phase 2 study results were a clear indicator of the efficacy of Endari® in preventing vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.

Based on the Phase 2 study data, Emmaus designed the pivotal Phase 3 study. The results of the Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of Endari® in both the primary and secondary endpoints. Below is a high-level summary of the data, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 20181.

Additionally, please visit the ""CEO Letters"" section of the Emmaus Life Sciences website to stay informed of corporate updates and remarks:

https://www.emmausmedical.com/content/ceoletters/ceo-letter-sep-10-2019-193

Endari® Phase 3 Study Data

The Phase 3 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the following, among other positive findings:

25% less frequency of painful crises in treatment group (p=0.005) 33% less frequency of hospitalization in treatment group (p=0.005) More than 60% decrease in the frequency of Acute Chest Syndrome, one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease, among patients treated with Endari®, (p=0.003)

Additionally, patients administered both hydroxyurea and Endari® experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered hydroxyurea and a placebo.

Patients administered Endari® also experienced improved health outcomes compared to those administered the placebo. The safety profile of Endari® was similar to that of the placebo.

The design of the Phase 3 study was sound and agreed upon by the FDA. Also, the imputation of missing data was appropriate as pre-specified. The design of the study prevented hydroxyurea use from influencing either treatment group.

The outcomes of both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are consistent and support the mechanism of action for Endari® in preventing oxidative damage to sickle red blood cells.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

XLRN announced the discontinuation of a phase II study evaluating its pipeline candidate, ACE-083, in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Although the candidate achieved growth in muscle volume in FSHD patients, it failed to deliver a meaningful functional benefit on top of it.

Data from the study showed that ACE-083 achieved statistically significant increase in mean total muscle volume, the study’s primary endpoint. However, the company announced that the increase in muscle volume failed to translate into improvements in functional tests of statistical significance, representing secondary endpoints. This failure resulted in the company’s decision to discontinue further development of the candidate in FSHD patients.

So far this year, Acceleron stock has gained 2.7% against the industry’s decline of 1.2%.

Meanwhile, the company continues to develop ACE-083 as a treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, another neuromuscular disorder in a phase II study. Top-line data from this study is expected in the first quarter of 2020.

We note that the company had discontinued development of another pipeline candidate, ACE-2494 in April. The candidate was being developed in a phase I study as a potential treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Higher frequency of anti-drug antibodies generation was observed in patients, which was the primary reason behind the discontinuation of its development.

Acceleron is developing its lead pipeline candidate, luspatercept, in collaboration with Celgene CELG for the treatment of chronic anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes, beta-thalassemia and myelofibrosis.

Two regulatory applications seeking approval for the candidate as a treatment for beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes associated anemia are under review with the FDA.

Currently, the company is also developing sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”), a rare disease with high unmet medical need. The FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to sotatercept for PAH earlier this month.

In June, Acceleron completed enrolling patients in the PULSAR study and plans to report top-line data from the same in the first quarter of 2020. Also, the company is currently recruiting subjects in the SPECTRA exploratory study to have a better understanding of sotatercept's potential impact on PAH. Preliminary results from this study are expected in 2020.

II-VI has agreed with SAMR that it will operate separately, for a period expected to be three years, the wavelength selective switch business of Finisar. The clearance decision from SAMR satisfies the closing condition set forth in the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger regarding the receipt of antitrust approvals. II-VI expects the closing of its acquisition of Finisar (the “Merger”) to occur on or about September 24, 2019.



In accordance with the merger agreement governing the Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), holders of Finisar common stock and holders of certain restricted stock units issued by Finisar (collectively, the “Voting Securities”) have previously been provided the opportunity to elect the form of Merger consideration they wished to receive for each Voting Security they hold, being either (i) $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration”). The deadline for that election was July 15, 2019 (the “Election Deadline”), and the total amount of cash and II-VI Common Stock to be paid in the aggregate by II-VI is fixed. Holders of Voting Securities are deemed to have made no election if they failed to make an election, or revoked a prior election without making a new election, by the Election Deadline, or if their election materials were not received in proper form by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”) prior to the Election Deadline.

Holders of Voting Securities who made no election, or have validly withdrawn their election, are deemed to have elected the Mixed Consideration. Holders of Voting Securities who have validly made, and not previously withdrawn, an election prior to the Election Deadline regarding the form of merger consideration they wish to receive in the Merger will have until 5:00 p.m., New York time, on September 20, 2019 to withdraw their election if they wish to receive the Mixed Consideration. All other holders of Voting Securities who have validly made an election that is not so withdrawn will receive either the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration they have elected, in each case prorated as described below.

The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to automatic proration so that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of II-VI Common Stock paid to all holders of Voting Securities as a group will not change as a result of these elections.

The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $22.33 to $23.29 in the past one-month time frame.

The company has seen three negative estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few weeks, suggesting there may be trouble down the road. So, make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.

Finisar currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is negative.

Finisar will demonstrate the latest form factors, laser technology, and test equipment for high-speed connections in hyperscale data centers, 5G wireless networks, and optical test systems. See these demonstrations and more in Finisar's booth 62 at the RDS Venue in Dublin, September 23-25.

400GBASE-SR4.2 QSFP-DD transceivers for high-speed data centers

Finisar and Foxconn Interconnect Technology are showcasing the industry's first interoperability demonstration of 400G SR4.2 QSFP-DD optical transceivers at the Finisar booth. These IEEE-compliant transceivers use eight fibers and an MPO-12 optical connector which provide a low total cost solution for 400G data rate upgrades using the installed base of multimode cabling deployed for 100G SR4 in data centers today. The IEEE P802.3cm task force has made a baseline proposal for 400GBASE-SR4.2 which includes support for up to 70m on OM3 and 100m on OM4 multimode fiber, aligned with the 400G BiDi MSA. This is the second short-reach 400G multimode transceiver announced by Finisar, following the 400G SR8 OSFP module demonstrated at OFC earlier this year.

100G PAM4 VCSEL technology for hyperscale data centers

Finisar is unveiling the industry's first public technology demonstration of a multimode VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) transmitting at 100G data rates using PAM4 modulation. This technology demonstration is a critical milestone towards product developments that can enable 800G short-reach optical modules and active optical cables (AOCs) needed for next-generation hyperscale data centers. Traditionally, multimode transceivers and AOCs that utilize VCSEL technology have offered the lowest cost for short-reach interconnect applications, a trend that is expected to continue with 800G+ products that are based on 100G PAM4 per lane. Attendees will be able to observe the optical performance of the prototype VCSEL’s over multimode fiber using a high-speed scope.

5G Wireless Front-haul Ecosystem featuring Tunable SFP28 transceivers

Finisar is showcasing various optical transceiver modules for 5G wireless front-haul networks. Driven by the anticipation of very large volume deployments, wireless front-haul applications will require cost-efficient high data rate solutions. Such applications in 5G networks are expected to require primarily 25G data rates, and Finisar is already offering several products covering 300m, 2km and 10km reaches. For 10km, Finisar provides both duplex and bidirectional transceiver solutions to help customers with optical fiber constraints. For C-RAN applications, Finisar is demonstrating LAN-WDM and O-band CWDM solutions, which enable more efficient wireless front haul networks with a minimum number of optical fibers.

As part of its 5G product offering, Finisar is also demonstrating full C-band DWDM wavelength tunable SFP28 modules operating at 25Gb/s over 15km of single mode fiber. These transceivers provide significant advantages over fixed wavelength solutions for carriers upgrading their networks to the latest wireless standards. Leveraging DWDM technology allows more efficient use of the limited installed fiber in the front-haul network. Finisar’s market-leading wavelength tunable SFP28 transceivers also provide operational efficiencies and savings over fixed wavelength products. These products will be available with Finisar’s patented Flextune™ wavelength self-tuning functionality.

WaveAnalyzer 1500S High Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer

The WaveAnalyzer™ 1500S demonstrates high speed and high-resolution measurements on optical signals in the L-band of telecommunications, including OSNR and WDM analysis. This instrument has been designed to support developers of next-generation optical systems. In addition, the WaveAnalyzer 200A Portable Optical Spectrum Analyzer will demonstrate spectral measurements in a compact, portable, battery operated platform. This instrument supports trouble shooting in Data Center Interconnects as well as mobile measurements in a lab environment.

This compares to earnings of $0.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.55%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering no surprise.

Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.

Gladstone Capital, which belongs to the Zacks Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry industry, posted revenues of $12.52 million for the quarter ended March 2019, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.64%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.09 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Gladstone Capital shares have added about 30.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.5%.

What's Next for Gladstone Capital?

While Gladstone Capital has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gladstone Capital was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.22 on $12.51 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.86 on $49.91 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry is currently in the bottom 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Intends to Appeal Delisting Determination from Nasdaq; Securities to Trade on OTC,"BEIJING, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. (HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Loan investors expect commitments due on at least 10 deals for $6 billion, while the pipeline is thin for junk-rated issuance. Investment-grade borrowers may sell about $15 billion of bonds.

The syndication of loans and a high-yield bond to finance Apollo Global Management Inc.’s buyout of online retailer Shutterfly are expected to continue this week after failing to sell following investor pushback on price and terms. Commitments on the reworked debt sale were due Friday after banks had to fund the LBO, which closed before the loans and bonds could price after negotiations with investors dragged out.

Loans with commitments this week include technology solutions provider CDW’s $1.45 billion refinancing loan, Guidehouse’s $640 million of debt to help finance its planned acquisition of Navigant Consulting Inc. and Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc.’s $440 million loan. Meanwhile, Merlin Entertainments may launch a jumbo cross-border deal as soon as this week. The buyout loan may include about $592 million in U.S. dollar term loans as well as a U.S. dollar bridge facility.

Borrowers have launched loans worth about $50 billion so far this month, making September the biggest month for new deals in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Several companies including Shutterfly struggled to attract demand last week as investors forced some issuers to hike yields and sweeten terms.

Some junk-rated borrowers may hold off on plans to issue new debt this week to give investors time to digest the recent deluge of new bonds. Supply is favorable for money managers despite issuance remaining light, with net sales currently at negative $3.2 billion year-to-date, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. About $49 billion of bonds have left the junk market as companies got upgraded to investment-grade, which more than offset the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance that added to junk volume, according to the bank.

“More than 72% of this year’s gross issuance has been associated with debt repayment and/or refinancing,” Goldman Sachs credit analysts led by Lofti Karoui wrote in a report last week. “As a result, a portion of the $45.9 billion of organic net issuance likely includes maturities that have been ‘pre-funded’ but have not yet reached their call (or maturity) date, resulting in an artificially inflated net supply figure (until those maturities formally roll off).”

In the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market, dealers are projecting as much as $15 billion in new supply over the five days. A record 127 issuers have taken advantage of the current low interest rates and heightened investor demand to borrow over $154 billion for debt refinancing in September.

“If rates stay here I think supply will be heavy going into the end of the year,” Scott Colyer, chairman and chief executive officer at Advisors Asset Management Inc., said in an interview. “Because the absolute cost of borrowing is so low, companies will think of borrowing and with rates this cheap, M&A and share buyback look pretty good.”

In the distressed world, bondholders will be keeping a close eye on debt payments due Monday, including from Intelsat SA, Mallinckrodt Plc, Iconix Brand Group Inc., Jason Industries Inc. and Ultra Petroleum Corp.

Credit investors will also be watching for potential market volatility that may be sparked by the repurchase agreements market. The Federal Reserve is gearing up for the third quarter, with $100 billion overnight repo operations expected to be repeated Monday.

“Spreads are narrow, there’s plenty of liquidity so at this point in time, the credit markets are just fine, operating as they should,” said Colyer. “As we get closer to the end of the cycle, we have started to move up the credits quality scale.”

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced that on September 6, 2019 it received a letter from the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has granted the Company's request to extend the exception period through September 23, 2019 in order for the Company to regain compliance with its periodic filing obligations.

As previously reported, on August 30, 2019 the Company informed the Panel that it was unlikely that the Company would regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements during the exception period previously granted by the Panel due primarily to the remaining analysis required in connection with the accounting treatment by the Company of the leasing/rental contracts of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”). Cantaloupe was acquired by the Company on November 9, 2017. These issues are not related to the internal investigation, were recently discovered during the audit process, and must be resolved by the Company in order for the Company’s independent auditor to complete its audit procedures.

The Company believes that it will be able to complete its work related to the accounting of the Cantaloupe lease/rental contracts and finalize the closing of its fiscal year 2019 books and records and provide its auditors with appropriate and sufficient audit evidence in a time frame that will permit its independent auditor to complete its audit in order for the Company to become compliant with its periodic reporting obligations by no later than September 23, 2019.

The Panel has informed the Company that, if the Company does not regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations by September 23, 2019, it will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

As also previously reported, on July 10, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months following the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Meeting”). On July 17, 2019, the Company submitted to the Panel a written plan to regain compliance with respect to its failure to timely hold the Annual Meeting, and requested the Panel to grant an exception in order for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting after it has regained compliance with its periodic reporting requirements. The September 6, 2019 letter from the Office of General Counsel of Nasdaq indicated that the Panel had declined to address that request at that time, opting to wait until the Company demonstrated compliance with its periodic reporting requirements, and directed the Company to submit a new plan of compliance to the Panel by no later than September 23, 2019 which would accelerate the timing of the Annual Meeting.

USA Technologies, Inc. (USAT) (the “Company”), a cashless payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the self-service retail market, today announced it has submitted a letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) requesting the Panel to grant to the Company the maximum possible exception period permitted under applicable Nasdaq rules and interpretations, or until September 23, 2019, and informing the Panel that it was unlikely that it will regain compliance with its periodic filing requirements by September 9, 2019. The maximum possible exception period is 360 days from the due date of the Company’s initial late filing as extended by a Form 12b-25 filing, if applicable. Additional information regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K the Company filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As previously reported, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These delinquencies resulted from an internal investigation conducted by the Company’s Audit Committee, the commencement and results of which were disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2018 and January 14, 2019, respectively. In this regard, and as previously disclosed, the Company received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, the Company’s securities were subject to delisting. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, the Company requested a hearing with the Panel, and following the hearing, the Panel determined to continue the Company’s listing pursuant to an exception through September 9, 2019. The Panel’s decision required the Company to, among other things, become current with its periodic filing requirements by such date and to provide written updates to the Panel on May 30, 2019, June 28, 2019, July 31, 2019, and August 15, 2019. These updates were filed with the Panel as required.

The Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with its periodic reporting obligations, and anticipates doing so by no later than September 23, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for the maximum possible exception period through September 23, 2019. In such event, the Panel will issue a final delisting determination and the Company’s securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.

Marks 20th Anniversary of ePort Debut with “Powering Your Unattended World” Themed Booth; Showcases Cutting-Edge Technologies, Partnerships and New Research

The NAMA Show - Today, USA Technologies (USAT) (“USAT”), a premier digital payment, consumer engagement and logistics service provider for the self-service retail market, marked the 20th anniversary of the debut of the ePort which was first unveiled at NAMA in 1999, bringing one of the first cashless payment platforms to the self-serve retail industry. With an eye toward USAT’s continued leadership in innovation, USAT branded its booth, “Powering Your Unattended World,” and showcased new technologies, partnerships and research throughout the show.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190426005366/en/

“Twenty years ago, we ushered in the era of cashless in the vending market with ePort Connect,” said Stephen P. Herbert, CEO of USA Technologies. “Since then, USAT has been at the helm of industry innovation, a change agent powering cashless adoption industry-wide. Early on, we began to recognize the benefits and opportunities possible through cashless technologies. USAT has since grown to support over 15,000 customers and approximately one million connections. We believe we have one of the largest NFC mobile footprints in the US retail market. We were excited to celebrate this incredible accomplishment at NAMA and look forward to continuing to drive innovation and shape the self-serve retail marketplace for decades to come.”

During the show, USAT’s booth focused on the strength of its enterprise platform for unattended retail through its booth design and messaging: bringing consumer engagement and rewards, the benefits of both top-line revenue opportunities through digital payments and the bottom-line margin opportunities through increased efficiencies, logistics and merchandising.

Seed Markets Expansion: USAT announced that Seed Markets is now fully integrated with some of the industry’s large micro market providers, including 365 Retail Markets, Avanti Markets, Company Kitchen, Three Square Market and Yoke Payments. Through the Seed Markets’ cloud-based and mobile solution, micro market operators can now benefit from one standard set of tools including simplified route management, efficient warehouse pre-picking, a single reporting interface and cash accountability. Seed Markets was also featured in NAMA’s New Product Zone.

Apple Pay Cash Study: In its main booth, USAT highlighted a rewards program promoting Apple Pay Cash where a consumer can receive a discount if they use Apple Pay Cash at a participating ePort location. This program was piloted by Five Star and the white paper was available to show to attendees and is now available for download here.

Michigan State University Study on Low Performing Machines: While many vending operators prioritize equipping high-volume machines with cashless technology, USAT’s study in partnership with Michigan State University found that low performing machines can offer significant revenue growth as well. Vending operators who added cashless technology to machines with less than $2,000 a year in sales experienced top line sales growth of 110 percent on average over the first 18 months following deployment, and cash sales increased by an average of 97 percent on the low performing machines during that same period. The results were presented on the show floor on Thursday, April 25th during NAMA Learning Lab and the full press release announcing the results can be found here.

Partnerships in Action: In its Partner Pavilion, USAT showcased its technology in real life scenarios such as in workplace break rooms, the airport and more, with various industry partners across the vending, micro-market and office coffee services segments. Participating partners include 365 markets, ShelfX, and Bunn. Starbucks and Avanti Markets are also showcasing USAT’s technology in their booths.

“USA Technologies has been a great partner,” said Karalynn McDermott, Senior Vice President of Market Development at Bunn-O-Matic Corporation. “The support and reliability we receive from USA Technologies, as well as their proven system, allows us to grow and innovate. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the company as the convenience service industry continues to grow.”

“Imperial has been a Seed customer for more than 10 years, and it has completely revolutionized our business,” said Lance Whorton President of Imperial Companies. “Through USAT’s Seed technology, we can now ensure our machines are full, our routes are growing and our products are targeted to the preferences of consumers. This ensures we are bringing a better experience to our clients and consumers while increasing our top line sales which continue to grow year-over-year-over-year.”

The NAMA show ran from April 24-26 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, NV.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:XYN).

What Is Insider Buying?

It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.

Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.'

View our latest analysis for Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

Does Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 69% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Do The Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?

The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings. Nice! Along with insider transactions, I recommend checking if Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings is growing revenue. This free chart of historic revenue and earnings should make that easy.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.

Co-Founder Yinglin Xu made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.5m worth of shares at a price of US$10.15 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$3.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Yinglin Xu.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage U.S.-China oncology drug development company, announced that it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) seeking Fast-Track designation for its drug candidate abexinostat as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“r/r FL”).

Fast-Track designation is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drug candidates, which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease, and address an unmet medical need. A drug candidate that receives Fast-Track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondences with the U.S. FDA and potential accelerated or priority review and more. The U.S. FDA will review the request and attempt to make a decision within 60 days.

According to Cancer.net, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of lymphoma in the U.S. and Europe. Xynomic is conducting a Phase 2 trial to test abexinostat as a single agent in patients with r/r FL. Designed as a single arm trial, this trial will enroll approximately 120 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have undergone at least three lines of therapy to test abexinostat as a fourth line monotherapy.



The U.S. FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). A global, randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway to test abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has received approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to start two pivotal clinical trials in China. In these two trials, Xynomic will test its lead drug candidate abexinostat (as a single agent) as a third-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and as a third-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), respectively.

According to China’s National Cancer Center and China’s National Health Commission, DLBCL is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype with an estimated 50,000 new cases per year in China and FL is the most common indolent NHL subtype with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year in China. DLBCL and FL combined represent approximately 45-60% of China’s NHL market.

According to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation’s database, Xynomic’s abexinostat is the only drug candidate currently under clinical development as third-line treatment of DLBCL in China. Xynomic plans to complete patient enrollment for these two trials in 12 months or sooner. These trials will be conducted in about 24 leading hematological cancer hospitals across China.

“We are truly excited to receive the approval from NMPA of China, world’s second largest market for oncology drugs. Currently in China there are virtually no approved treatment options for DLBCL and FL patients once the patients’ disease progress after R-CHOP treatment. Our abexinostat has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in these settings in prior Phase 1/2 trials. We look forward to completing these trials expeditiously and have also started preparation for commercial launch,” said Y. Mark Xu, Xynomic’s Chairman and CEO.
