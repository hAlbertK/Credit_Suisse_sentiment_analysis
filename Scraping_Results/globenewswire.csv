PlayTime with KittyPlays, a monthly series that will debut in the spring of 2019, will be a live esports entertainment and variety show, featuring top influencers and celebrity guests; competitive gameplay across a range of titles and genres; fan interaction and participation; and unique commentary on current news and esports issues, all streamed in front of a live studio audience at HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“I’m so excited to take my stream to the live stage and interact with my community in person,” said Michaela. “We are going to have an incredible lineup of guests on the show to talk, play and have some fun, and I can’t wait to share this experience with everyone in the arena and those watching on the live stream.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays will be the first of multiple original content debuts planned for release by Allied Esports this year. As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame Holdings International, will be acquired, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: BRAC), to form Allied Esports Entertainment. Creating premier live experiences, multiplatform content and interactive online services that reach and engage a worldwide audience of players and viewers, is a central part of Allied Esports Entertainment’s mission.

“Partnering with talented and popular streamers like KittyPlays to create fresh, interactive events and content is a key component of our growth strategy,” said Frank Ng, current CEO of Ourgame and expected CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “PlayTime is an outstanding kickoff to a year of what we intend to be a much larger, comprehensive content offering to come from Allied Esports, and we’re confident that Kristen’s magnetic personality and skill will carry this concept far beyond our own lofty expectations.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays, which will be produced by Allied Esports with Michaela serving as co-executive producer, will utilize Allied Esports’ multimillion-dollar broadcast studio and arena in the HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, featuring a two-story LED video wall, two-dozen cameras, wired player comms, and a dedicated control room for game observers called The Observatory, to create an unparalleled live experience and compelling streamed and post-produced content that will be available to viewers following each episode. Allied Esports has produced a number of original productions over the past year, including Ninja Vegas ’18 starring Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, which at the time set a new Twitch record for viewers on an individual stream and garnered 2.4 million unique viewers over the seven-hour event.

Each episode of PlayTime with KittyPlays will feature approximately six hours of original content, including:

Michaela and her guests leading into the live program with a “Just Chatting” pre-show stream on their individual channels starting two hours beforehand;

Topical and personal thought-provoking conversations with esports’ top influencers and celebrity guests energized by live audience member and stream chat participation;

Michaela’s unique perspective on recent events and issues facing today’s gaming communities;

Live, high-level gameplay, including “Squad Fills” and challenges with Michaela’s special guests and lucky audience members chosen at random.

Segments showcasing Michaela teaching pro athletes and celebrity gamers how to improve their craft;

Pre-recorded video shorts highlighting up-and-coming esports stars.

Led by Michaela’s naturally inclusive and positive personality, PlayTime with KittyPlays will also focus on giving a voice to those in the esports space who have gone unrecognized, who hail from diverse backgrounds, and who have overcome adversity to achieve personal bests in gaming and beyond.

Information about live guests, show dates, tickets and viewing platforms will be released in the coming weeks. Fans can follow @KittyPlays, @Allied Esports and @HyperXESALV and visit alliedesports.gg and hyperxesportsarenalasvegas.com for updates and additional news.

Michaela started her career in esports as a Counter-Strike player and began streaming her gameplay on Twitch while attending the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. After seeing success with her broadcasts, Michaela decided to leave school to pursue streaming full time, leading her to the wildly popular game of Fortnite. Since then, Michaela has taken streaming and social media by storm with her focus on positivity, community, and joy in gaming and everyday life. Whether broadcasting games, traveling the world, designing cosplay characters, or simply living a health-conscious life, Michaela’s style and personality play a large part in the creation of her content.

Michaela, who primarily plays Fortnite on her stream, is host to one million-plus followers on Twitch and boasts more than a million monthly viewers between Twitch, YouTube and other social media channels. During E3’s 2018 Celebrity Pro-Am event she paired with actor Chandler Riggs (The Walking Dead) and carried the duo to a third-place finish winning $250,000, with her portion donated to her local charity of choice, Kelowna BC SPCA. Most recently she teamed up with FaZe Clan’s Turner “Tfue” Tenney to compete in Korea’s Fortnite Open. Michaela again dominated the competition and together the pair took home a first-place prize of $1,000,000 to be donated to charity.

What started as a part-time hobby to meet likeminded friends has grown into a career that delivers enthusiasm and positivity to Michaela’s audiences, creating real connections around the world and leaving a lasting positive effect on everyone that watches her. Michaela is the founder of Team Kitty, a Twitch-based networking and mentorship team that enhances Michaela’s vision to create a network of female creators focused on upbeat personalities and high-level viewer interaction. Michaela is currently the Head of New Gaming Initiatives for esports organization Gen.G, with a focus on signing competitive players for its female Fortnite team, as well as sales and building of Gen.G’s newly renamed brand.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today provided an operational and financial update for its subsidiaries Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa Upstream”) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher Midstream”) and announced that Alta Mesa Upstream has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



Operational Update

Alta Mesa Upstream

First quarter 2019 production is estimated to be 37,800 BOE per day (48% oil, 71% liquids). Alta Mesa Upstream entered the year with six rigs actively working and reduced the rig count to zero by the end of January. A new development program was restarted in March by completing 16 drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) and operating two drilling rigs. The Company’s objective with the development program is to improve economic returns through a revised well spacing pattern of four or five wells per section, improved lateral placement and lower well costs. Under the reinvigorated development program, Alta Mesa Upstream has drilled 10 wells completing eight patterns (including the DUCs) and through May 17, 2019 had brought 22 new wells onto production. These wells are all tied into Kingfisher Midstream’s system.

The wells drilled and completed in 2019 have been averaging less than $3.0 million per well compared to $4.5 million per well experienced by the end of the previous drilling program. The Company has also made material progress on reducing lease operating expenses on a unit cost basis and lowering recurring general and administrative costs. More detail will be provided when it reports first quarter 2019 financial results.

Kingfisher Midstream

Kingfisher Midstream’s estimated first quarter volumes are summarized below.

System Gas Volumes 137 MMcf per day

Produced Water Volumes 85,000 Bbl per day

Crude Oil Volumes 6,600 Bbl per day

Proved Reserves

On February 25, 2019, Alta Mesa Upstream provided an initial estimate of 158 MMBoe for December 31, 2018 proved reserves. Based on its April 2019 assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and the uncertainty of funding the related development costs, Alta Mesa Upstream removed a total of 89 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2018, Alta Mesa Upstream had 69 MMBoe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 25 MMBbl of oil, 20 MMBbl of natural gas liquids and 144 Bcf of natural gas. The reserves have a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $813 million. Should Alta Mesa Upstream’s ability to fund the required development costs improve in the future, Alta Mesa Upstream expects to recognize all or a portion of the removed PUD reserves as proved.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update

At May 1, 2019, Alta Mesa Resources had debt with total face value of $1,061 million and $144 million of total liquidity, including $110 million of cash. Alta Mesa Upstream’s total debt was $868 million, comprised of $368 million utilized on its credit facility and $500 million of senior notes. The Company previously disclosed that Alta Mesa Upstream had drawn substantially all remaining capacity under its Credit Facility on April 1, 2019. As of May 1, Alta Mesa Upstream’s liquidity includes $95 million of cash.

Kingfisher Midstream had total borrowings on May 1, 2019 of $193 million within its available credit capacity of $225 million, resulting in liquidity of $47 million comprised of $32 million of available borrowing capacity and $15 million cash on hand. Until the delivery of audited 2018 and unaudited first quarter 2019 financial statements and the related compliance certificates, Kingfisher Midstream is limited to $225 million of borrowing capacity. Once those financials are delivered, the borrowing capacity, subject to continued covenant compliance, will return to $300 million.

The Company continues to make progress in finalizing its Form 10-K as well the first quarter 2019 Forms 10-Q for both Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Upstream but is unable to estimate the date at which these filings will be completed.

NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards

The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified Alta Mesa Resources on May 14, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and because the Company remains delinquent in filing its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Initial Delinquent Filing”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa Resources is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing by June 3, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Initial Delinquent Filing, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

Alta Mesa Resources is working to complete its annual and quarterly reports and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Provides Bank Borrowing Update; Retains Financial Advisor; Receives NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards","HOUSTON, April 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today announced that Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“AMH”) had drawn substantially all of the remaining capacity under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of $370 million after the most recent borrowing base determination on April 1, 2019, which decreased the borrowing base by $30 million. The cash held following the draw, approximately $86 million, is intended for general corporate purposes.



James Hackett, the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In this challenging environment, we believe it is important to increase our liquidity to ensure we have adequate financial flexibility. We will continue to explore our options to strengthen our balance sheet, including options to address our indebtedness.”

Alta Mesa has retained Perella Weinberg Partners and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. as its financial advisor to assist with analyzing and considering financial alternatives.

Alta Mesa today also announced that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified the Company on April 2, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Annual Report”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing within 60 calendar days from the date of notification, or by June 1, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Annual Report's filing due date, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

The Annual Report was not filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time period because the Company needs additional time to complete its financial statements and related disclosures. As previously announced, the Company expects to report material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company has taken additional time to ensure the accuracy of its 2018 financial information, to complete the required discussion and analysis of the business and to finalize the conclusions regarding the assessment of internal control. Although the Company is still completing its testing of internal control, it has not identified material misstatements to its previously filed financial information and believes that no restatements to historical periods will be required. While covenant relief was not attained during the borrowing base redetermination, the Company continues to be in discussions with its lenders under the Credit Facility. If unsuccessful in obtaining relief, the Company may be unable to comply with the terms of the Credit Facility during 2019, which would permit the lenders to cease making amounts available under the Credit Facility, to require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and to exercise other rights under the Credit Facility.

Alta Mesa is working to complete the Annual Report and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Alta Mesa also announced today that NASDAQ notified the Company on April 3, 2019 that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the NASDAQ rules for continued listing. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ’s exchange. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 30, 2019, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 30, 2019, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and September 30, 2019 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed compliance period. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notice.

Findings show that over 70% of companies already have AI applications in use or under development, and as the use of AI grows, IT professionals must consider what infrastructure is needed to maximize the value, scale and performance of their AI workloads.



The State of Enterprise AI Adoption 2019 survey was constructed to help identify the state of enterprise AI adoption, evaluate the perception and value of AI in the enterprise and determine the infrastructure being used to execute AI workflows. The report findings, based on responses of more than 300 IT professionals across a broad range of industries, show that many organizations, 39%, are using supercomputers, HPC systems or dedicated AI hardware to run their AI workloads. For these organizations using on-premises systems, over 60% expect to expand their infrastructure to keep pace with increasing storage and performance demands.

“The research highlights that supercomputing plays an important role in enabling mainstream AI adoption in the enterprise,” said Frederick Kohout, senior vice president and CMO at Cray. “IT professionals see the need to expand their use of on-premises infrastructure, like supercomputers and HPC clusters, to meet the expected growth of business-critical AI applications. Cray’s new Shasta supercomputing systems were designed to handle data-intensive workloads, like AI, and can scale seamlessly from a single cabinet to exascale-class systems so every Enterprise can start small and grow without interruption or penalty.”

Enterprise AI Production Environments Hybridized with Cloud and On-Premises Infrastructure

Nearly 40% of those surveyed said their organizations currently use on-premises systems to execute AI workloads. This includes infrastructure like supercomputers, high performance computing clusters and dedicated AI nodes. And according to these respondents, the top two considerations for utilizing on-premises systems are performance and data locality/security.

While about 40% report using on-premises systems,

65% of respondents with AI applications in use stated they need to expand their on-premises systems to keep pace with increasing performance requirements

35% of respondents are looking to move some of their cloud workloads to on-premises systems

53% of respondents noted that their organization utilizes public cloud services to run AI workloads

The research indicates that many organizations are operating a hybrid data center and rely on the use of multiple systems to run AI applications. Over 70% of those using on-premises systems have also implemented AI in the public cloud, and over half of all public cloud users also utilize on-premises infrastructure for their AI workloads.

Also of note, nearly 60% of IT professionals identified cost-effectiveness as a top consideration when selecting an infrastructure solution for AI. This was followed by the ability to integrate AI systems into existing architecture (50.8%), ease of use (49.2%) and scaling with increasing uses and demands (39.8%). With these being the top infrastructure considerations, it explains why so many organizations utilize both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. By utilizing both, enterprises get the ease of use and cost-effectiveness of the cloud with the performance and scalability of on-premises systems.

“This survey by Cray is consistent with our own AI research studies,” said Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research. “Training for machine learning requires high performance computing, either on-premise or in the cloud, and there is a significant overlap between AI investment and systems for HPC and hyperscale. One way or another, those interested in AI need to access a high-performance infrastructure.”

Other Key Research Findings

High levels of educational activity: 72% of respondents participated in one or more activities to educate themselves on AI in the past year. Over 48% attended AI conferences or received training, over 41% participated in vendor webinars, about 40% took self-study courses and over 35% downloaded and read reports on AI.

(NASDAQ:CRAY) today announced an entirely new, open and extensible software platform to address the growing need for supercomputing across government and private industries. As advanced simulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation create new, data intensive workloads, the need for performance at scale is growing rapidly. Recognizing the challenges presented by the exascale era, Cray’s software fuses supercomputing performance and capability with the modularity, composability and ease-of-use of cloud computing. In a separate press release issued today, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) announced that Cray has been awarded a third U.S. exascale system contract. The system, dubbed “El Capitan,” will be sited at LLNL. Cray now has $1.5 billion in business for Shasta™ supercomputing systems and the new software platform.



“The Shasta software used with the El Capitan system expands traditional supercomputing to support the complex workflows and numerous 3D studies necessary to unlock the full potential of exascale computing,” said Bill Goldstein, lab director at LLNL. “The flexibility and extensibility of El Capitan’s software and hardware environment will enable the NNSA laboratories to explore and develop capabilities that leverage the combination of AI and machine learning with modeling and simulation to accelerate time-to-solution for our national security codes. These technologies could apply equally well to multi-physics codes employed outside of the national security domain.”

Reports 2018 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Feb. 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.

All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

For 2018, Cray reported total revenue of $456 million, which compares with $393 million in 2017. Net loss for 2018 was $72 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $134 million, or $3.33 per diluted share in 2017. Non-GAAP net loss, which adjusts for selected unusual and non-cash items, was $58 million, or $1.42 per diluted share for 2018, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $41 million, or $1.01 per diluted share in 2017.

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $163 million, compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $13 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $98 million, or $2.42 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Please note, 2017 GAAP results were impacted by both the new U.S. tax law and a change to the valuation allowance held against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The combined negative impact on the Company’s 2017 GAAP net loss was $103 million and was excluded for non-GAAP purposes.

For 2018, overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 29%, compared to 33% and 34%, respectively, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2017.

GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $204 million, compared to $196 million in 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $191 million, compared to $177 million in 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, cash, investments, and restricted cash totaled $246 million. Working capital at the end of 2018 was $291 million, compared to $354 million at December 31, 2017.

“Led by strength in our commercial business, we delivered solid growth for the year,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “While our target market continues to show signs of a rebound from its recent lows, 2019 is shaping up to be a transition year as we plan to begin shipping our next generation Shasta platform late this year. Shasta will deliver a balance of performance, flexibility and ease of use unlike anything available today, as well as a true exascale-class architecture capable of scaling well into the future. With continued focus and execution, we are well positioned to expand on our market leadership position and deliver strong long-term growth.”

Outlook

For 2019, while a wide range of results remains possible, Cray expects revenue to grow modestly compared to 2018. Revenue is expected to be about $70 million for the first quarter of 2019. For 2019, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be in the 30% range, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow compared to 2018. Based on this outlook, the Company expects to recognize a substantial GAAP and non-GAAP net loss for 2019.

Cray’s effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2019 are both expected to be in the low single-digit range.

Actual results for any future periods are subject to large fluctuations given the nature of Cray’s business.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

Additionally, we have not quantitatively reconciled the non-GAAP guidance measures disclosed under “Outlook” to their corresponding GAAP measures because we do not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items such as share-based compensation, adjustments to the provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles, costs related to acquisitions, purchase accounting adjustments, and gain on significant asset sales, as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations to the non-GAAP guidance measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our financial results.

(Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced that the first Cray Shasta™ supercomputing system for operational weather forecasting and meteorology will be acquired by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The powerful high-performance computing capabilities of the new system, named HPC11, will enable higher fidelity weather forecasts for U.S. Air Force and Army operations worldwide. The contract is valued at $25 million.



“We’re excited with our Oak Ridge National Laboratory strategic partner’s selection of Cray to provide Air Force Weather’s next high performance computing system,” said Steven Wert, Program Executive Officer Digital, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, and a member of the Senior Executive Service. “The system’s performance will be a significant increase over the existing HPC capability and will provide Air Force Weather operators with the ability to run the next generation of high-resolution, global and regional models, and satisfy existing and emerging warfighter needs for environmental impacts to operations planning.”

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a history of deploying the world’s most powerful supercomputers and through this partnership, will provide supercomputing-as-a-service on the HPC11 Shasta system to the Air Force 557th Weather Wing. The 557th Weather Wing develops and provides comprehensive terrestrial and space weather information to the U.S. Air Force and Army. The new system will feature the revolutionary Cray Slingshot™ interconnect, with features to better support time-critical numerical weather prediction workloads, and will enhance the Air Force’s capabilities to create improved weather forecasts and weather threat assessments so that Air Force missions can be carried out more effectively.

“The HPC11 system will be the first Shasta delivery to the production weather segment, and we’re proud to share this milestone with ORNL and the Air Force,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO at Cray. “The years of innovation behind Shasta and Slingshot and the success of prior generations of Cray systems continue to demonstrate Cray’s ability to support demanding 24/7 operations like weather forecasting. This is a great example of the upcoming Exascale Era bringing a new set of technologies to bear on challenging problems and empowering the Air Force to more effectively execute on its important mission.”

HPC11 will be ORNL’s first Cray Shasta system, as well as the first supercomputing system with 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ processors for use in operational weather forecasting. HPC11 will join the 85% bastion of weather centers that rely on Cray, and will feature eight Shasta cabinets in a dual-hall configuration.

“We are incredibly excited to continue our strategic collaboration with Cray to deliver the first Shasta supercomputer to the U.S. Air Force, helping to improve the fidelity of weather forecasts for U.S. military operations around the globe,” said Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager, Datacenter and Embedded Systems Group, AMD. “The 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors provide exceptional performance in highly complex workloads, a necessary component to power critical weather prediction workloads and deliver more accurate forecasts.”

The system is expected to be delivered in Q4 2019 and accepted in early 2020.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

(NASDAQ: DVCR), a premier provider of long-term care services, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019.



First Quarter 2019 Highlights

Net loss from continuing operations was $(3.3) million, or $(0.52) per share, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $(0.1) million, or $(0.01) per share, in the first quarter of 2018.

Our adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $15.5 million, compared to $18.2 million in the first quarter of 2018.

Under the new Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") 842, the Company recorded net leased assets and liabilities of $384 million and $389 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our operational and financial performance during the first quarter of 2019 continued to reflect the challenges we have been experiencing in our industry, but we do have some opportunities for improvement on the horizon. Our Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care rates all increased during the quarter. The increases are a combination of cost reimbursement along with acuity factors for our centers. We have enrolled the majority of our Texas centers in the state’s Quality Incentive Payment Program, which we expect to be effective for these centers in September of this year. This program rewards operators who maintain high quality measures with enhanced Medicaid reimbursements. We are implementing cost reductions to align our overhead cost structure with the current environment. CMS has proposed a net 2.5% market basket increase for this coming October. Year over year, our skilled mix patients decreased from 16.1% in the first quarter of 2018 to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2019. It should be noted though that this quarter was the highest skilled mix we have seen since the first quarter of 2018.""

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""I am extremely grateful for and proud of our team members as they continue to be devoted to our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

First Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.9 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 10.1 % 11.6 % Medicaid census 68.7 % 67.9 % Managed Care census 4.8 % 4.5 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 18.6 % 21.1 % Medicaid revenues 47.3 % 45.2 % Managed Care revenues 10.6 % 10.1 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 457.10 $ 455.72 Medicaid $ 181.13 $ 176.78 Managed Care $ 394.55 $ 391.96

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $134.4 million and $141.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $6.9 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 134,353 $ 136,571 $ (2,218 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,714 $ (4,714 ) Total revenue $ 134,353 $ 141,285 $ (6,932 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.7 million of the $6.9 million patient revenues decrease. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $2.2 million. Our average Medicaid and Medicare rates per patient day for the first quarter of 2019 increased compared to the first quarter of 2018, resulting in increases in revenue of $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, or 2.5% and 0.3%, respectively. Our Hospice average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 increased 15.8%, resulting in $1.0 million in additional revenue. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 13.4%, 0.1% and 10.1%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $4.1 million, $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Our ancillary revenue for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.3 million.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the first quarter of 2019 to $108.1 million as compared to $112.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.5% for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.5% for the first quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store operating expense $ 108,113 $ 109,101 $ (988 ) 2018 disposition operating expenses

— 3,177 (3,177 ) Total expense $ 108,113 $ 112,278 $ (4,165 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $3.2 million of the $4.2 million operating expense decrease. Our same-store operating expenses decreased by $1.0 million, which is mostly attributable to favorable variances in nursing and ancillary costs and salaries and related taxes of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable variances in dietary costs and maintenance and utilities expense of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $65.1 million during the first quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the first quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the $1.7 million impact of non-cash straight-line expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.4 million and $2.8 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.9 million and $1.1 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the accrual for professional liability.

General and administrative expense was $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2019 from 5.8% in the first quarter of 2018. The change in general and administrative expense is attributable to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in depreciation expense relates to the dispositions of Fulton, Clinton and Glasgow in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Interest expense was $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million first quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.2 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $4.3 million before income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. The benefit for income taxes was $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2019, and the benefit for income taxes was $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. Both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $0.52 for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations of $0.01 in the first quarter of 2018.

Receivables

Our net receivables balance decreased $2.4 million to $63.9 million as of March 31, 2019, from $66.3 million as of December 31, 2018.

We have included certain financial measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAR as EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as EBITDAR adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense and litigation contingency expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense, litigation contingency expense, tax impact related to those adjustments, and discontinued operations, net of tax. Funds Provided by Operations is defined as net income from operating activities adjusted for the cash effect of professional liability and other non-cash charges. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred tax benefit and other non-cash charges.

Our measurements of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses, separation costs and other items. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred taxes and other non-cash items. Our presentation of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

(NASDAQ: DVCR), a premier provider of long-term care services, today announced its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



Second Quarter 2019 Highlights

In the second quarter, the Company and the Department of Justice (""DOJ"") reached an agreement in principle to settle its ongoing investigation. As a result of this agreement, the Company increased its litigation contingency accrual by $3.1 million to a total of $9.5 million.





The Company recognized an additional $20.0 million of non-cash income tax expense related to the increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during the quarter.





Net loss from continuing operations was $(24.6) million, or $(3.80) per share, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $(0.3) million, or $(0.05) per share, in the second quarter of 2018.

Our adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $16.4 million.

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our primary update for the quarter is the announcement that we have reached an agreement in principle to settle the ongoing DOJ investigation into the Company’s therapy practices dating back to 2010. This investigation period predates our leadership team and has been a significant distraction for quite some time. We still have some work ahead of us to finalize the agreement and related Corporate Integrity Agreement, but reaching this agreement in principle represents substantial progress in resolving this matter. We ask that our investors please refer to our updated SEC filings for further information.""

Mr. McKnight continued, “You will note that we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this quarter via a non-cash tax expense item of $20 million. The accounting guidance related to matters like this is very complicated, but because of our government settlement and other financial factors we were required to complete the process of evaluating these assets this quarter. We believe we have significant positive financial evidence that we will continue to evaluate each quarter going forward.”

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""We made significant progress on our exit from Kentucky this quarter, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. Our industry continues to experience challenges and strong headwinds; however, I am proud and amazed by the level of commitment that our team members continue to exude in their efforts to deliver on our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

Second Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.8 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 9.7 % 10.6 % Medicaid census 69.2 % 68.9 % Managed Care census 4.6 % 4.2 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 17.9 % 19.7 % Medicaid revenues 47.5 % 46.5 % Managed Care revenues 10.5 % 9.4 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 458.33 $ 455.29 Medicaid $ 181.42 $ 177.58 Managed Care $ 393.81 $ 397.49

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $135.4 million and $141.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $5.7 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 135,370 $ 136,544 $ (1,174 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,538 (4,538 ) Total revenue $ 135,370 $ 141,082 $ (5,712 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.5 million of the $5.7 million decrease in patient revenues. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $1.2 million. Our average Medicaid rate per patient day for the second quarter of 2019 increased compared to the second quarter of 2018, resulting in an increase in revenue of $1.6 million, or 2.1%. Our Hospice and Managed Care average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 increased 14.2% and 7.6%, respectively, resulting in $1.0 million and $0.8 million in additional revenue, respectively. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 decreased 9.6%, 0.6% and 13.3%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $2.7 million, $0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the second quarter of 2019 to $108.6 million from $111.4 million in the second quarter of 2018, a decrease of $2.8 million. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.3% for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.0% for the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

2018

Change

Same-store operating expense $ 108,447 $ 107,850 $ 597 2018 disposition operating expenses

194 3,590 (3,396 ) Total expense $ 108,641 $ 111,440 $ (2,799 )





The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 reduced operating expenses by $3.4 million. Our same-store operating expenses increased by $0.6 million, which is mostly attributable to increases in health insurance costs of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by decreases in nursing and ancillary expenses and maintenance and utility costs of $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.8 million in the second quarter of 2018, to $65.2 million during the second quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the second quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the impact of non-cash straight-line rent expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.0 million and $3.2 million in the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.7 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims.

In June, 2019, the Company and the U.S. Department of Justice reached an agreement in principle on the financial terms of a settlement regarding a civil investigative demand. In anticipation of the execution of final agreements and payment of a settlement amount of $9.5 million, we recorded an additional loss contingency expense of $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 to increase our previously estimated and recorded liability related to this investigation.

General and administrative expense was $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $9.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019 from 6.6% in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease in general and administrative expense is mainly attributable to $1.2 million of executive severance expense in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining change is due to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in depreciation expense relates to the acceleration of depreciation for the leasehold improvements in Kentucky, which are expected to be abandoned in the third quarter of 2019.

Interest expense was $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.1 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

The Company recorded an income tax provision of $17.4 million during the second quarter of 2019 and an income tax benefit of $0.4 million during the second quarter of 2018. The increase in income tax expense is attributable to a non-cash charge for a valuation allowance recognized against our deferred tax assets in the amount of $20.0 million in the second quarter of 2019.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $7.2 million before income taxes for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2018. Both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $3.80 for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations of $0.05 in the second quarter of 2018.

Receivables

Our net receivables balance increased $1.7 million to $68.0 million as of June 30, 2019, from $66.3 million as of December 31, 2018.

We have included certain financial performance and valuation measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss), which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, debt retirement costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate and income (loss) from discontinued operations.

Our measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important financial performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses and separation costs. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

We have included Adjusted EBITDAR in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s valuation. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAR is an important financial valuation measure that is commonly used by our management, research analysts, investors, lenders and financial institutions, to compare the enterprise value of different companies in the healthcare industry, without regard to differences in capital structures and leasing arrangements. Adjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure and is not displayed as a performance measure as it excludes rent expense, which is a normal and recurring operating expense. As such, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR, should not be construed as a financial performance measure.

New Spin-Off Record Date Set for July 15, 2019



MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., July 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND) , a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, and Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today provided an update on the planned merger and spin-off transaction announced on January 7, 2019. The respective special stockholder meetings will be held today, July 9, 2019, to consider approval of the proposed merger and spin-off transaction. Subject to approval by holders of record of the companies at the respective special stockholder meetings, MYnd will issue a number of shares of common stock to the current Emmaus shareholders, which will result in MYnd shareholders retaining 5.9% of the fully diluted shares of the 'New Emmaus' post-closing and a pro rata distribution of one share of Telemynd’s common stock for each share of MYnd common stock held at the end of trading on July 16, 2019. The companies have set a new Spin-Off Record Date of July 15, 2019 in order to comply with certain NASDAQ and DTC requirements. Those individuals who hold shares at the close of trading on the 16th of July will receive the Telemynd dividend. MYnd shares will trade ex-dividend on July 17, which means that persons who purchase MYnd shares on July 17 will not receive shares of Telemynd.

It is expected that on July 16 and July 17, the necessary steps will occur to spin off Telemynd with the current MYnd assets, effectuate the merger and any adjustments needed to meet NASDAQ listing standards and commence trading on July 18, 2019 under the new symbol “EMMA.”

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “We are very grateful for this opportunity to merge with MYnd Analytics. The anticipated listing on Nasdaq via the merger with MYnd Analytics is an important step to maximize value for shareholders. We look forward to sharing with the public markets our progress on the market acceptance of Endari, which is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years and older. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other major clinical indications such as diverticulosis.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are pleased with the progress of the merger and spin-off transaction, which remains on track to close before the end of this month, subject to approval of shareholders. We believe this transaction will drive significant value for all shareholders, and we will provide further updates following the respective shareholder meetings.”

A registration statement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which includes the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus of MYnd and Emmaus, which was declared effective by the SEC.

Endari addresses a $3 billion worldwide market

MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., Jan. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND), a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, today announced that it has entered into a definitive stock-for-stock merger agreement with Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Emmaus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MYnd Analytics in exchange for MYnd Analytics’ issuance of common stock to Emmaus shareholders and other equity holders. The exchange ratio will result in Emmaus securityholders owning approximately 94% of the MYnd Analytics’ common stock on a fully diluted basis after the merger. It is anticipated that the surviving company will change its name to Emmaus and receive a new ticker symbol to reflect the name change. The company expects to meet all applicable requirements for initial listing upon completion of the merger and, therefore, expects to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval from the shareholders of each company and Nasdaq approval. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as a financial advisor to Emmaus in connection with this transaction.

In connection with the transaction, MYnd Analytics intends to transfer all of its assets (including cash and its equity interest in Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services, LLC) and liabilities into its wholly-owned subsidiary, MYnd Analytics California, and to distribute the shares of MYnd Analytics California to MYnd Analytics’ shareholders as of a record date prior to the merger, which will be set prior to the merger effective time. MYnd Analytics expects that the MYnd Analytics California subsidiary, following the spinoff, will commence trading as an independent company at a date to be announced. Under the leadership of its new CEO, Patrick Herguth, the MYnd Analytics California spin off intends to continue operating, integrating and growing its technology-enabled telepsychiatry and teletherapy businesses in order to provide enhanced access to behavioral health services, improve patient outcomes and help lower the costs associated with behavioral health issues. MYnd-Arcadian customers include major health plans, health systems, and community-based organizations. The parties do not expect there to be any disruption to the existing business or customers.

Emmaus is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, including those in the rare and orphan disease categories. Its lead prescription product, Endari, demonstrated positive clinical results in a completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell disease and received FDA approval in July 2017. Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. The results of the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on July 19th, 2018.

Emmaus launched Endari in the United States in early 2018 and has experienced strong market uptake. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Additionally, Emmaus has distribution agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors, making Endari available to selected pharmacies nationwide.

Outside the United States, the treatment is currently available through an Early Access Program for sickle cell disease patients that have exhausted other treatment options. Emmaus is currently in the process of seeking marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency for its medication. Emmaus has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA which provides protection from competition in the United States and Orphan Medicinal designation from the European Commission for protection in the European Union.

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “The merger with MYnd Analytics, and concurrent Nasdaq listing, will be a major milestone for the company, and builds on our recent progress, including the FDA approval of Endari, the publication of our Phase 3 results in The New England Journal of Medicine , Medicaid coverage, the addition of major pharmaceutical distributors, and a presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 Annual Meeting. Just as important as these accomplishments was the launch and market acceptance of Endari – the first medication (FDA approved) for sickle cell disease in almost 20 years. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other clinical indications such as diverticulosis. Through this merger, we believe we can maximize value for shareholders and we are grateful to MYnd for this opportunity.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are excited to announce this definitive merger agreement with Emmaus, whereby the MYnd shareholders will own equity in Emmaus, and upon our expected spin-off, will continue to own 100% of the predictive analytics and telemedicine business, which we expect to begin operations as a new standalone public company. We are quite encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to further integrating and accelerating the growth of our offerings under Patrick Herguth’s leadership. We plan to provide further details on the new operational direction, branding, and growth strategy in the coming weeks and months.”

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle Cell Disease is an orphan disease with significant unmet medical needs, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide.

Fred’s net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 5.2% to $319.0 million from $336.4 million in the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 8.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. The sales decline was primarily the result of weak sales of consumables caused by the reduction in store traffic due to out-of-stock issues in certain product categories.

Fred’s gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 16.2% to $74.6 million from $89.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 309 basis points to 23.4% from 26.5% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage was primarily caused by discounting initiatives implemented during the quarter throughout the store chain.



Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter decreased $7.9 million to $101.4 million compared to last year’s first quarter of $109.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 68 basis points to 31.8% of sales from 32.5% of sales in the first quarter last year. The decrease is generally attributable to continued reductions in headcount and other general cost-containment initiatives implemented throughout the company.



Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $93.4 million, or 29.3% of sales, in Q1 of 2019 compared to $106.7 million, or 31.7% of sales, in Q1 of 2018.



Due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles in several underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. Comparatively, in the first quarter of 2018, no impairment expense was incurred.



For the first quarter of 2019, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $29.5 million, or $(0.84) per share, compared to a net loss of $22.0 million, or $(0.60) per share, during the same period in 2018. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to a decline in the sales volume during the period ended May 4, 2019 compared to the prior year.



Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(11.7) million compared to $(7.4) million in the first quarter of 2018.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 resulted in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which constitutes an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced store closures, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s has entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders pursuant to which Fred’s stipulated to the occurrence of certain events of default and such lenders agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to not take any action to accelerate our indebtedness or exercise other remedies until July 22, 2019. There can be no assurance that such lenders will not do so on or after such date or if the conditions in the forbearance agreement are not met in the future. For additional information regarding this agreement and Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern, please see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2019 and Fred’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 4, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 18, 2019.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation. amortization and impairment expense (i.e. Total selling, general and administrative expenses) and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

(NASDAQ: FRED) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 2, 2019. Except as otherwise noted, the results contained herein have been adjusted for discontinued operations related to the sale of Fred’s specialty pharmacy business to an affiliate of CVS Health Corporation and certain assets of Fred’s retail pharmacy business to Walgreen Co. The amounts and percentages presented below, for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial conditions from Fred’s continuing operations.



Joe Anto, Fred’s CEO, stated “This is clearly a challenging time for the Company and we are disappointed with our operating results for the quarter and fiscal year. We are working to optimize our store footprint, cost structure and operating model, while also addressing concerns regarding our liquidity profile. As of April 30, 2019, our ABL balance stood at $78.3 million versus $58.6 million at the end of Q4. Additionally, we are working on various sale processes for non-core assets, including certain real estate and our remaining pharmacy script portfolio.”

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(48.1) million in fiscal 2018 compared to $20.3 million in fiscal 2017.

Fourth Quarter 2018 Results

Fred’s net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 17.2% to $307.1 million from $370.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 9.7% compared to a 4.8% decrease in the fourth quarter of last year.

Fred’s gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 22.1% to $71.7 million from $92.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 147 basis points to 23.4% from 24.8% in the same quarter last year.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $23.6 million to $136.7 million compared to last year’s fourth quarter of $113.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses, increased 1,400 basis points to 44.5% of sales from 30.5% of sales in the fourth quarter last year.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $102.6 million, or 33.4% of sales, in Q4 of 2018 compared to $108.4 million, or 29.2% of sales, in Q4 of 2017.

Due primarily to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles related to underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $31.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Comparatively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Fred’s recorded impairment expense of $2.5 million.

For the fourth quarter of 2018, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $67.2 million, or $(1.86) per share, compared to a net loss of $25.4 million, or $(0.68) per share, during the same period in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(17.7) million compared to $31.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Fiscal Year End 2018 Results

Net sales for 2018 decreased to $1.272 billion from $1.396 billion in 2017 for a year-over-year decrease of $124.1 million or 8.9%. Comparable store sales for 2018 decreased 1.6% from the same period last year. Front store (non-pharmacy) sales decreased 11.8% over 2017 front store sales. The decrease year over year was primarily due to the clearance of merchandise that management identified as under-productive combined with our out of stock position of many key front store items.

Fred’s gross profit for the year decreased to $323.0 million in 2018 from $363.8 million in 2017, a year-over-year decrease of $40.8 million, or 11.2%. Gross margin rate, measured as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.4% in 2018 from 26.1% in 2017, an approximately 70-basis point decline. Factors contributing to the decline in gross margin were related to continued pressures Fred’s experienced in its retail pharmacy business, specifically related to prescription rebates in 2017 that did not recur in 2018 and an increase in DIR fees paid to PBMs. In the front store, gross margin was impacted by promotional markdowns as well as a shift in sales mix from general merchandise to food and consumables.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $452.5 million, or 35.6% of sales, in 2018 from $500.8 million, or 35.9% of sales, in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of bank fees, financing termination fees and professional fees incurred in 2017 related to the attempted Rite Aid acquisition and the closing of 39 underperforming stores in the prior year that were not repeated in 2018. Additionally, costs decreased as a result of the cost containment measures experienced during fiscal 2018.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $409.3 million, or 32.2% of sales, for the fiscal year 2018 compared to $439.2 million, or 31.5% of sales, for the same period in 2017.

Impairment expense of $33.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2018 related to long lived assets, including intangibles related to the decline in the results of operations compared to the $2.5 million recorded in fiscal 2017.

Net loss from continuing operations decreased $7.3 million to $137.2 million, or $(3.76) per share, in 2018 from a loss of $144.5 million, or $(3.87) per share, in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(48.1) million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $20.3 million in 2017.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 will result in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which will constitute an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement have indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced closure of 159 stores, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s is currently seeking an agreement with its lenders pursuant to which such lenders would forbear for a period of time from seeking remedies on account of, or waive, the foregoing events or potential events of default, but there is no assurance that Fred’s will receive such forbearance or waivers.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, announced today that the Company’s consolidated initial sales for its 2019/20 season pass offerings increased 20.8% on a unit basis and 19.8% on a dollar basis over the prior year through the discounted sales window, inclusive of Snow Time pass sales in both periods.



Jesse Boyd, Vice President of Operations, commented, “We are pleased with the continued robust growth for our season pass products as reflected in the 20.8% year over year growth in unit sales for the upcoming 2019/20 season, including healthy sales of our Peak Pass, which provides customers with unlimited skiing and riding across 14 of our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest resorts. Thanks to our investments and efforts to create consistent on-mountain conditions in the face of unpredictable weather, our customers know that their season pass will allow for season-long access to our mountains, regardless of weather. That consistency and the on- and off-mountain experience we provide are drivers of our season pass sales growth. In addition, our recent investments in customer outreach initiatives, including data and analytics attribution, social media, and strategic marketing and branding, are helping to better connect Peak Resorts with our customers as we showcase the value of our season pass offerings. We look forward to the upcoming season as we put further investments to work to create more compelling experiences across our mountains.”

The 2018/2019 season was one of the Company’s longest ski seasons in its history, including 147 days of skiing and riding at Mount Snow, 140 days at Hunter Mountain and an impressive 150 days at Wildcat. As our attention now turns to summer, Peak Resorts has a number of capital improvement projects planned for its growing resort portfolio. Work has already started on approximately $3.5 million in upgrades to the snowmaking infrastructure at Liberty Mountain, Whitetail and Roundtop Mountain in Pennsylvania. These investments across all three resorts will increase pump power and water capacity and add new state-of-the-art guns to markedly improve energy efficiency and overall snowmaking.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year as summarized below:

April 30, Year ended

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues $ 85,458 $ 56,032 $ 184,426 $ 131,662 Resort operating costs $ 42,699 $ 31,951 $ 119,737 $ 96,593 Income from operations $ 30,402 $ 17,413 $ 28,916 $ 10,219 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders for basic EPS $ 17,283 $ 9,280 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Net income (loss) available to common shareholders adjusted for diluted EPS $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Income (Loss) per share (basic) $ 1.13 $ 0.66 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Income (Loss) per share (diluted) $ 0.83 $ 0.56 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding 15,166 13,982 14,504 13,982 Vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) 155 102 133 78 Dilutive effect of conversion of preferred stock 6,359 3,180 - - Dilutive effect of unvested RSUs 36 44 39 - Reported EBITDA* $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585 *See page 3 for Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Fiscal 2019 was a record year for Peak Resorts as we completed several transformational initiatives that drove robust year over year growth. We generated record revenue and Reported EBITDA of $184.4 million and $49.8 million, respectively, thanks to our successful Snow Time acquisition and the fantastic execution of our resort operating teams who provided our guests with great conditions throughout a season of variable weather. We also delivered double-digit growth across our season pass offerings, saw continued strength across key revenue streams including food and beverage, ski school and retail, and benefited from our geographic and market diversification and ongoing customer outreach initiatives.



“Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%. Many of our resorts benefited from our continued strategic investments, including at Mount Snow where we saw the benefit of the new Carinthia Base Lodge and at Hunter where we debuted a significant terrain expansion, contributing to increased visitation of 6% and 12%, respectively, at these resorts. In addition, consistent investments in snowmaking capacity and efficiency allowed us to ensure that our growing visitor base was able to access more terrain and more often throughout the season, even when challenged by variable weather.

“As expected, the Snow Time portfolio delivered strong results in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and throughout the season despite nearly 20 fewer operating days during the season. The initial implementation of our operating strategies at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop allowed us to more than offset the shorter season at each of the three resorts as we drove a significant improvement in profitability across the portfolio. Given that we completed the acquisition of Snow Time right before the start of the 2018-19 season, we expect to see added benefits going forward as we further refine operations at these resorts.

“As announced in early May, 2019-20 season pass sales were very strong through the discounted sales window and we expect this momentum to continue. Sales of season passes, including our Peak Pass, which allows for unlimited access to 14 of our resorts across the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, were up 20.8% on a unit basis and 19.8% on a dollar basis over the prior year, inclusive of Snow Time pass sales in both periods. Pass sales momentum has continued and we are well positioned heading into what we believe will be yet another great winter season in 2019-20. We see clear signs that our season pass offerings have become the leading choice for skiers and riders who make the East Coast their home.

“With a strong finish to the 2018-19 season and strong season pass sales for the upcoming 2019-20 season, Peak Resorts is positioned for further growth in fiscal 2020. We are already working on roughly $3.5 million in snowmaking upgrades at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, and expect to see a full year of benefit from our recently awarded liquor license at Whitetail and our continued efforts to enhance our food and beverage operations. We also expect to see further benefits from investments in our resorts, including at Mount Snow, Hunter and more recently at Hidden Valley. Looking at the summer and fall seasons, we expect to benefit from a packed event schedule that will leverage our amazing resorts to generate revenue during our seasonally slow periods, including food and beer festivals, concerts, outdoor entertainment events and on-mountain activities such as zip lining and mountain biking.”

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 fourth quarter revenue increased 52.5% year over year to $85.5 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time for the full quarter as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 11.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded an 81.1% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 34.4% rise in food and beverage revenue and 57.8% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter rose 33.6% year over year to $42.7 million due to the addition of Snow Time in the quarter as the Company managed its labor and other expenses in-line with its expectations. Power and utilities expenses were up 21.1% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity. Other operating expenses increased during the quarter due to the inclusion of the Snow Time resorts and organic spending on IT projects, repairs and maintenance and insurance costs. General and administrative expenses were up 184.3% to $4.7 million driven primarily by increased compensation expense as a result of the Company’s strong fiscal 2019 fourth quarter performance and additional professional service fees associated with the Snow Time acquisition.

Reported EBITDA for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 was $36.9 million, compared to $21.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The 71.5% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of operations from Snow Time as well as organic growth of roughly 14.3% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of April 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $30.2 million and total outstanding debt of $229.8 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and short and long-term debt of $217.4 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts exited fiscal 2019 positioned for further growth as we continue to integrate the Snow Time resorts and benefit from improved operations and greater scale across our resort portfolio. Our operating teams remain focused on managing costs and driving increased efficiency and enhanced profitability across each area of our business even as we maintain our commitment of providing the highest level of guest service possible.

“As our attention turns to fiscal 2020 and beyond, we believe we have the needed financial flexibility to continue to improve existing operations while also exploring opportunities to drive cash flow and improve our capital structure. With our focus on the continued improvement across the entirety of our business, we are excited by what the future holds and for the opportunities ahead.”

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

April 30, Year ended

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,987 4,273 4,704 (3,962 ) Interest expense, net 4,505 3,586 15,788 13,322 Depreciation and amortization 6,077 3,553 19,618 13,231 Acquisition related costs 419 - 1,045 - Restructuring and impairment charges - 549 190 2,135 Other income (90 ) (43 ) (159 ) (160 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (83 ) (83 ) (333 ) (333 ) Reported EBITDA $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results and our good start to the 2018-19 ski season, given variable weather patterns and at times challenging conditions across the Northeast and Midwest. By combining our healthy organic growth with the addition of the three Snow Time resorts to our operating base beginning in late November, as well as our ongoing efforts to diligently manage expenses, Peak Resorts was able to overcome these challenges and generate revenue, net income and Reported EBITDA growth of 42%, 48% and 46% in the fiscal 2019 third quarter, respectively.

“Organic revenue and Reported EBITDA both grew roughly 10% in the 2019 fiscal third quarter, largely driven by the two major projects that debuted for the 2018-19 season. Mount Snow benefited from the new Carinthia Base Lodge, which dramatically expanded on-mountain services at the resort and provided a very popular parking, mountain access and après ski destination for our guests. Snowmaking investments at Mount Snow also allowed us to offer guests the predictable and stable conditions they have come to expect, despite variable weather throughout the quarter. Hunter Mountain also saw healthy visitation growth driven by the Hunter North terrain expansion, which has improved guest flows across the mountain and increased uphill capacity and parking access.

“The benefits of the Snow Time acquisition, which closed just before the start of the 2018-19 ski season in late November, are already evident as our three newest resorts delivered good financial performance despite a slightly later start to their seasons as a result of warm early winter temperatures. Through the addition of Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, we have diversified our business, allowing us to deliver improved financial performance across all conditions thanks to our broad geographic base, attractive amenities and our increasingly popular Peak Pass.

“Peak Pass sales for the 2019-20 season began last week as we continue to deliver on our promise to provide enhanced value and unlimited mountain access, including additional resorts for next season and flat pricing through the April 30 early season window. Adding the three Snow Time resorts to the pass for the first time further expands skiing and riding options for our guests which, combined with its attractive price point, should allow the Peak Pass to take additional market share as more Northeast and Midwest guests see the value of an unlimited, multi-mountain offering. We believe the Peak Pass is unmatched in the industry and we look forward to welcoming new and returning guests this summer and into the 2019-20 season and beyond.

“Peak Resorts has never been better positioned to grow our business and enhance value for our shareholders. Peak Pass sales grew at double-digit rates for the 2018-19 ski season as the pass benefits from increased visibility and growing acceptance across a broader geographic area, including some of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our on-mountain additions such as the Carinthia Base Lodge and the Hunter North terrain have greatly improved the guest experience. Ongoing efforts to enhance snowmaking across our mountain portfolio allow us to deliver great skiing and riding conditions even when Mother Nature does not cooperate. And the addition of Snow Time has favorably scaled up our business. The future is bright for Peak Resorts and we look forward to finishing out the 2018-19 ski season.”

Fiscal Third Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenue increased 41.7% year over year to $84.0 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time beginning on November 26, 2018 as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 9.7% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded a 54.4% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 45.5% rise in food and beverage revenue and 44.1% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 third quarter rose 36.3% year over year to $49.0 million, with the 28.6% increase in labor expenses driven by the addition of Snow Time’s operations and offset in part by lower labor expenses at the Company’s same-store resorts as a result of the Attitash Hotel closure and efforts to manage staffing levels to combat minimum wage increases. Power and utilities expenses were up 51.9% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity at Mount Snow and Hunter, in particular, to refresh terrain following warmer temperature cycles. Other operating expenses in the quarter included higher insurance costs, new groomer leases and increased sales commissions. General and administrative expenses were up 145.5% to $3.3 million driven primarily by the addition of Snow Time, one-time acquisition-related expenses and increased performance-driven compensation expenses.

Reported EBITDA for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 was $30.7 million, compared to $21.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The 46.0% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA included the addition of Snow Time beginning in November 2018 as well as organic growth of roughly 9.6% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of January 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $27.2 million and total outstanding debt of $230.6 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and long-term debt of $218.2 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts remains in a very healthy financial position as the tireless efforts of our mountain operations teams allowed the Company to drive efficiencies across the business and enhance our profitability in the 2019 fiscal third quarter and going forward. Furthermore, we have added Snow Time’s three mountain operations to our business and are already benefitting from the enhanced scale even as we plan for further efforts to drive additional synergies in the coming quarter. In addition, with the major capital investments at Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain now behind us, our capital expenditure needs will decline going forward, allowing Peak Resorts to further improve its balance sheet and cash flow.

“As we wrap up the 2018-19 ski season, we are confident that Peak Resorts’ financial flexibility will allow us to continue our efforts to invest in and improve existing operations while exploring further opportunities to scale up the business through acquisition. We are excited by what the future holds for Peak Resorts and our shareholders and the entire team remains committed to exceeding our guests’ high expectations for value, access and service.”

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

January 31, Nine months ended

January 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income (loss) $ 13,631 $ 9,181 $ (9,167 ) $ (8,328 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 5,574 3,433 (3,283 ) (8,235 ) Interest expense, net 4,458 3,529 11,283 9,736 Depreciation and amortization 6,809 3,379 13,541 9,678 Restructuring and impairment charges - 1,586 190 1,586 Acquisition related costs 295 - 626 - Other income (22 ) (28 ) (69 ) (117 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (84 ) (84 ) (250 ) (250 ) Reported EBITDA* $ 30,661 $ 20,996 $ 12,871 $ 4,070

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Snow Time Season Pass Upgrade Results Demonstrate the Strong Appeal of the Unlimited Peak Pass

WILDWOOD, Mo., Nov. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peak Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, announced today that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of Snow Time, Inc. (“Snow Time”). Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Peak Resorts paid approximately $70 million in cash consideration to Snow Time and issued approximately 1.18 million shares of its common stock to Snow Time’s shareholders at a price of $5.07 per share, for total consideration of approximately $76.0 million. Financing for the cash portion of the purchase price consists of: a $50 million, two-year senior secured term loan from CAP 1 LLC, which will accrue interest at an annual rate of 6.95% and carry no prepayment penalty; and $20 million in proceeds from the sale of 20,000 shares of Series A cumulative convertible preferred stock and issuance of accompanying warrants to CAP 1 LLC pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement.

The Company also announced today that through October 31, 2018, Snow Time pass sales increased by approximately 20% on a unit basis and by approximately 19% on a revenue basis, compared to the prior year. Approximately 27% of Snow Time season pass holders took advantage of the Company’s buy-up offer and upgraded to the Peak Pass.

“We are delighted to kick off the winter season by welcoming Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop to the Peak Resorts family following the completion of our acquisition of Snow Time,” said Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer of Peak Resorts. “Our entire team is excited to begin working with the Naylor family’s three beautiful resorts as we look to build on their legacy and further elevate the guest experience while introducing the Peak Pass and our other resorts to skiers across the Mid-Atlantic. The addition of the Snow Time properties to our growing portfolio of Northeast and Midwest operations further expands our reach into the affluent and densely populated Baltimore and Washington D.C. markets and provides our customers in the Northeast with three new complementary and conveniently located mountains where they can ski and ride as well as enjoy a four season resort experience.

“We have also seen strong acceptance for the Peak Pass as demonstrated by the 27% of Snow Time pass holders who elected to trade-up to our unlimited pass offering through October 31. We are very pleased that Snow Time’s season pass holders are upgrading to the Peak Pass at such healthy levels, reflecting what we believe is their excitement to have an opportunity to ski at their home resort while also exploring the Catskills in New York, the Green Mountains in Vermont and the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Since introducing the Peak Pass, our goal has been to provide an unlimited pass for all ages that offers unmatched value for guests who live within driving distance of our resorts and visit us frequently throughout the season. We believe this goal is a key driver of our success and we look forward to a great 2018/2019 ski season.”

The acquisition of Snow Time expands Peak Resorts’ portfolio to 17 resorts across the Northeast and Midwest through the addition of three ski resorts in Pennsylvania – Liberty Mountain Resort, Whitetail Resort and Roundtop Mountain Resort – which are within driving distance of the Baltimore-Washington D.C. market, a metropolitan region that comprises nearly 10 million people. Snow Time’s three resorts welcomed more than 600,000 visitors during the 2017/2018 ski season and offer a combined 65 trails, more than 325 skiable acres, and an average of approximately 700 vertical feet of terrain. Through the transaction, Peak Resorts now operates two 18-hole golf courses, a 115-room hotel and 22,000 square foot conference center at Liberty Mountain Resort, and more than 20 food and beverage locations across the three acquired Snow Time properties.

About Stabilis Energy, Inc.

Stabilis Energy, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of small-scale liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production, distribution and fueling services to multiple end markets in North America. Stabilis has safely delivered over 200 million gallons of LNG through more than 20,000 truck deliveries during its 15-year operating history in the LNG industry, which it believes makes it one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America.

Stabilis’ customers also use LNG as a “virtual pipeline” solution when natural gas pipelines are not available or volumes are curtailed. Stabilis Energy, Inc. is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced the dosing of the first Chinese patient in its on-going global pivotal Phase 3 trial of Xynomic’s abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Dr. Jun Guo, Professor and Medical Director at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, is the leading principal investigator for this trial in China.

According to US International Trade Administration, China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, forecasted to grow from $108 billion in 2015 to $167 billion by 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. Total public and private healthcare expenditure reached $640 billion in 2015 and is expected to almost double to $1.1 trillion by 2020.

A global randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway of abexinostat + pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Currently, this trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and South Korea. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of RCC in Q1’2019.

“There are approximately 46,900 new cases of kidney cancer patients in China per year, according to Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Majority of patients develop resistance to pazopanib or other current standard-of-care therapies. Combining abexinostat with pazopanib has shown to reverse drug resistance in a Phase 1b study conducted by University of California, San Francisco and could significantly prolong patients' progression-free-survival time. We are excited to start the China arm of this on-going global trial and look forward to working with Dr. Jun Guo and other leading China kidney cancer specialists.” Mr. Y. Mark Xu, Chairman and CEO of Xynomic, commented.

In addition, Dr. Kapilan Rajagopalan has joined Xynomic as the Medical Monitor for clinical development. Prior to joining Xynomic, from 2016 to 2019 Dr. Rajagopalan worked as a Safety Case Manager and a Safety Operations Physician for Tata Consultancy Services, managing various pharmaceutical projects for Roche and Bayer. From 2014 to 2015, Dr. Rajagopalan was a MD/MBA intern at Humana. From 2012 to 2013, Dr. Rajagopalan was a family medicine resident physician at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. We believe that Dr. Rajagopalan’s experience in performing medical review for oncology pharmaceutical products and his MD education in the USA will enhance Xynomic’s medical monitoring function. Dr. Rajagopalan holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Cincinnati, graduating with Summa Cum Laude honors, a MBA from the University of Louisville with distinction, and a MD degree from the University of Cincinnati.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

(“Xynomic”, Nasdaq: XYN), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2 trial that combines abexinostat with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (“r/r MCL”) or relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“r/r DLBCL”) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). This trial will enroll approximately 40 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with r/r MCL or r/r DLBCL. This trial will also explore the biologic predictors of response and resistance to dual B-cell receptor (BCR) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. Janssen Biotech, Inc. is providing ibrutinib as part of the study, with Xynomic providing abexinostat and funding support for the trial being conducted at MSK.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has an annual incidence of approximately 6,500 in G7 countries, according to DR/Decision Resources, LLC. Ibrutinib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsed MCL and has response rates of 60-70% and median duration of response of 18 months. Abexinostat as a mono therapy has been shown to have response rate of 15.4% (7.7% complete response and 7.7% partial response) in r/r MCL patients. Researchers at MSK are testing whether abexinostat/ibrutinib combo could potentially improve response rates and duration of responses in r/r MCL patients, subject to the assessment upon the completion of the trial.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) subtype according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). Researchers at MSK have shown preclinical data demonstrating that dual targeting of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in the BCR pathway with ibrutinib and inhibition of MyD88-driven NF-kB activation with a HDAC inhibitor lead to synergistic anti-lymphoma activity in MyD88 mutated, ABC-subtype DLBCL both in vitro and in vivo.

Abexinostat is a novel HDAC inhibitor in global pivotal trials against NHL and renal cell carcinoma. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class BTK inhibitor jointly developed and commercialized as IMBRUVICA® by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company and has been approved for multiple hematological malignances and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD).

These speculations have caused significant damage to our Company and we are resolved to take such actions necessary to defend ourselves and protect the interests of our shareholders. Additionally, we have instructed counsel and are working with the Nasdaq to explore our recourse against Hindenburg Research for making such irresponsible, baseless and libelous statements, including but not limited to instituting legal proceedings against them.

Our investigation concerns whether Yangtze has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated.” The Hindenburg report described Yangtze as “a scheme run by its Chairman & controlling shareholder to siphon money away from U.S. public markets.” Among other allegations, the Hindenburg report asserted that Yangtze’s “only operating entity has been declared insolvent in China and is involved in multiple undisclosed legal proceedings” and, citing “government-sourced documents and interviews with local officials, we believe that at least 77% of the company’s reported assets are fabricated.”

On this news, Yangtze’s share price fell by more than 28%, closing at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base.

I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today provided an operational and financial update for its subsidiaries Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa Upstream”) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher Midstream”) and announced that Alta Mesa Upstream has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



Operational Update

Alta Mesa Upstream

First quarter 2019 production is estimated to be 37,800 BOE per day (48% oil, 71% liquids). Alta Mesa Upstream entered the year with six rigs actively working and reduced the rig count to zero by the end of January. A new development program was restarted in March by completing 16 drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) and operating two drilling rigs. The Company’s objective with the development program is to improve economic returns through a revised well spacing pattern of four or five wells per section, improved lateral placement and lower well costs. Under the reinvigorated development program, Alta Mesa Upstream has drilled 10 wells completing eight patterns (including the DUCs) and through May 17, 2019 had brought 22 new wells onto production. These wells are all tied into Kingfisher Midstream’s system.

The wells drilled and completed in 2019 have been averaging less than $3.0 million per well compared to $4.5 million per well experienced by the end of the previous drilling program. The Company has also made material progress on reducing lease operating expenses on a unit cost basis and lowering recurring general and administrative costs. More detail will be provided when it reports first quarter 2019 financial results.

Kingfisher Midstream

Kingfisher Midstream’s estimated first quarter volumes are summarized below.

System Gas Volumes 137 MMcf per day

Produced Water Volumes 85,000 Bbl per day

Crude Oil Volumes 6,600 Bbl per day

Proved Reserves

On February 25, 2019, Alta Mesa Upstream provided an initial estimate of 158 MMBoe for December 31, 2018 proved reserves. Based on its April 2019 assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and the uncertainty of funding the related development costs, Alta Mesa Upstream removed a total of 89 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2018, Alta Mesa Upstream had 69 MMBoe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 25 MMBbl of oil, 20 MMBbl of natural gas liquids and 144 Bcf of natural gas. The reserves have a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $813 million. Should Alta Mesa Upstream’s ability to fund the required development costs improve in the future, Alta Mesa Upstream expects to recognize all or a portion of the removed PUD reserves as proved.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update

At May 1, 2019, Alta Mesa Resources had debt with total face value of $1,061 million and $144 million of total liquidity, including $110 million of cash. Alta Mesa Upstream’s total debt was $868 million, comprised of $368 million utilized on its credit facility and $500 million of senior notes. The Company previously disclosed that Alta Mesa Upstream had drawn substantially all remaining capacity under its Credit Facility on April 1, 2019. As of May 1, Alta Mesa Upstream’s liquidity includes $95 million of cash.

Kingfisher Midstream had total borrowings on May 1, 2019 of $193 million within its available credit capacity of $225 million, resulting in liquidity of $47 million comprised of $32 million of available borrowing capacity and $15 million cash on hand. Until the delivery of audited 2018 and unaudited first quarter 2019 financial statements and the related compliance certificates, Kingfisher Midstream is limited to $225 million of borrowing capacity. Once those financials are delivered, the borrowing capacity, subject to continued covenant compliance, will return to $300 million.

The Company continues to make progress in finalizing its Form 10-K as well the first quarter 2019 Forms 10-Q for both Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Upstream but is unable to estimate the date at which these filings will be completed.

NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards

The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified Alta Mesa Resources on May 14, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and because the Company remains delinquent in filing its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Initial Delinquent Filing”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa Resources is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing by June 3, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Initial Delinquent Filing, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

Alta Mesa Resources is working to complete its annual and quarterly reports and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Provides Bank Borrowing Update; Retains Financial Advisor; Receives NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards","HOUSTON, April 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today announced that Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“AMH”) had drawn substantially all of the remaining capacity under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of $370 million after the most recent borrowing base determination on April 1, 2019, which decreased the borrowing base by $30 million. The cash held following the draw, approximately $86 million, is intended for general corporate purposes.



James Hackett, the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In this challenging environment, we believe it is important to increase our liquidity to ensure we have adequate financial flexibility. We will continue to explore our options to strengthen our balance sheet, including options to address our indebtedness.”

Alta Mesa has retained Perella Weinberg Partners and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. as its financial advisor to assist with analyzing and considering financial alternatives.

Alta Mesa today also announced that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified the Company on April 2, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Annual Report”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing within 60 calendar days from the date of notification, or by June 1, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Annual Report's filing due date, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

The Annual Report was not filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time period because the Company needs additional time to complete its financial statements and related disclosures. As previously announced, the Company expects to report material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company has taken additional time to ensure the accuracy of its 2018 financial information, to complete the required discussion and analysis of the business and to finalize the conclusions regarding the assessment of internal control. Although the Company is still completing its testing of internal control, it has not identified material misstatements to its previously filed financial information and believes that no restatements to historical periods will be required. While covenant relief was not attained during the borrowing base redetermination, the Company continues to be in discussions with its lenders under the Credit Facility. If unsuccessful in obtaining relief, the Company may be unable to comply with the terms of the Credit Facility during 2019, which would permit the lenders to cease making amounts available under the Credit Facility, to require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and to exercise other rights under the Credit Facility.

Alta Mesa is working to complete the Annual Report and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Alta Mesa also announced today that NASDAQ notified the Company on April 3, 2019 that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the NASDAQ rules for continued listing. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ’s exchange. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 30, 2019, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 30, 2019, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and September 30, 2019 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed compliance period. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notice.

(“ChinaCache” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq GS: CCIH), a leading total solutions provider of Internet content and application delivery services in China, today announced in a recent Form 6-K report that on September 4, 2019, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company stating that The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market.



The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting. Additionally, as of the date of this release, the Company continues to make progress with the completion of its delinquent annual report and intends to file these reports with the SEC.

Thereafter, the Company intends to work with a market maker to file a Form 211 with FINRA to enable the Company’s shares to begin trading on the over-the-counter markets.

“While there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to execute its plan. If the shares resume trading on the over-the-counter markets, the shares may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on Nasdaq. While trading on the over-the-counter-markets the Company expects to apply for a Nasdaq listing at a future time.” concluded Mr. Liu.

(NASDAQ: CCIH) on Behalf of ChinaCache Stockholders and Encourages ChinaCache Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, May 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is investigating potential claims against ChinaCache International Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: CCIH) on behalf of ChinaCache stockholders. Our investigation concerns whether ChinaCache has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



Click here to participate in the action.

On April 29, 2019, ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for the 2018 fiscal year. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (“Chairman”), Song Wang (“Wang”), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

On May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019 because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the “NASDAQ Letter”). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache’s engagement of its new independent auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

(the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions. Engaged Capital and certain of its affiliates, collectively holding nearly 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, have entered into voting agreements committing them to, among other things and subject to its terms, vote in favor of adopting the acquisition agreement.

“Over the course of our review, the Committee evaluated a full range of strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives to best serve the interests of our stockholders. After a thorough process, including considering Del Frisco’s current operations and future prospects, the Committee and the Board is confident that this transaction offers the most promising opportunity to realize the highest value for our stockholders,” said Joe Reece, Committee Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“In consultation with our outside advisors, the Board has been evaluating several strategic and financial alternative options since December 2018. This transaction offers immediate liquidity at a significant premium for our stockholders while providing the best path forward for our Del Frisco’s brands, our employees, and loyal guests,” said Ian R. Carter, Board Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“L Catterton brings a distinguished track record of fostering the growth and success of world class experiential brands. Together with their deep operational expertise in the restaurant industry, I am confident L Catterton will be a great long-term partner,” said Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

Del Frisco’s comprises four leading brands across two distinct business lines -- Del Frisco’s Grille and Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in the steak and grill category, and bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar in the upscale regionally-inspired cuisine category. Upon the close of the transaction, L Catterton plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar businesses separately from the steakhouse brands in order to nurture the unique attributes of the brands.

“At L Catterton, we bring more than just capital – we bring significant operational expertise to our investments,” said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. “Over the last 30 years, L Catterton has invested in nearly 30 restaurant concepts globally to create a number of industry leaders. Del Frisco’s has four outstanding brands in two distinct and attractive categories – upscale regionally-inspired cuisine, and steak and grill. We’re excited to partner with the Company to harness the power of these brands by operating the upscale regionally-inspired brands separately from the steak and grill concepts.”

L Catterton has invested in restaurant concepts such as Bloomin' Brands Inc. (including Outback Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill), CÉ LA VI, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Crystal Jade, Culinary Concepts by Jean-Georges, P.F. Chang's, Uncle Julio’s and many more.

Announces Additional Synergies and Cost Savings","IRVING, Texas, May 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today announced a reduction in force (“RIF”) that is expected to generate significant pre-tax general and administrative cost savings of approximately $3.0 million in 2019 and $5 million on an annualized run-rate basis. This brings the total expected synergies from the Barteca acquisition and other cost savings to approximately $15 million.



Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer of Del Frisco's, said, “We have identified additional synergy opportunities to enhance our efficiencies and streamline our teams now that we have moved past our recent development ‘peak’ of 15 restaurant openings in the space of 10 months. We have now opened six of our planned eight restaurant openings for 2019 and, with the Barcelona and bartaco integration nearly complete and new IT systems now in place ahead of our original schedule, we are making necessary adjustments to move forward in a more dynamic way that will not impact our future growth plans. There is no change to our long term disciplined growth target of 10% to 12% new restaurant openings every year, which we are firmly on track to hit in full year 2019.”

Abdallah continued, “Notably, these reductions in G&A provide immediate cost savings and are on top of the more than $10 million in integration benefits that we have previously identified to be realized by 2020 or 2021. A significant majority of these savings will be in place on a run rate basis by the end of 2019.”

Abdallah added, “A reduction in force is a difficult but necessary step and we are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and support through this period of change.”

The RIF will impact all levels of the organization in Del Frisco’s restaurant support center, the field across three of the four brands and our contract support. In total, approximately 12% to 15% of G&A positions will be impacted during Q2 and Q3 of 2019. Customary transition assistance will be provided to affected employees. Del Frisco’s expects to incur total non-recurring restructuring charges of approximately $0.3 million to $0.5 million on a pre-tax basis for severance payments and other termination costs.

With the completion of six of eight planned 2019 openings through the first half of 2019, there is stronger line of sight to full year pre-opening costs and capital expenditure. The Company is lowering its annual outlook for pre-opening costs to $4.5 million to $5.5 million (previous range was $5 million to $7 million). It also expects to be close to the middle of its guidance range of $25 million to $35 million in capital expenditure with improved capital cost management, notably at the Barcelona and bartaco brands.

Abdallah concluded, “With respect to the strategic alternatives review process announced in December 2018, our board of directors continues to work with Piper Jaffrey & Co., our financial advisor, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, our legal advisor, in a diligent manner.” No assurances can be made that the review will result in any particular outcome.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results","IRVING, Texas, Aug. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 25, 2019.



On June 24, 2019, Del Frisco’s announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton, a consumer-focused private equity firm, will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.

The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by the Board with the assistance of the Board’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

In view of the pending transaction, Del Frisco’s has withdrawn its fiscal year 2019 guidance and long-term outlook and will not host a conference call to discuss these second quarter 2019 financial results.

Key Highlights from the 13-Week Second Quarter 2019 Compared to the 13-Week Second Quarter 2018 Include:

Consolidated revenues increased 73.9% to $131.7 million from $75.7 million due primarily to $21.1 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $28.2 million in contributions from bartaco.



Total comparable restaurant sales increased 0.5%.

GAAP net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.



Adjusted net loss* of $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income* of $3.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.



GAAP operating loss of $0.6 million, compared to GAAP operating loss of $3.0 million

Adjusted EBITDA* increased 60.3% to $13.1 million from $8.2 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 10.0% from 10.8%.



Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased 74.9% to $28.3 million from $16.2 million due primarily to $5.2 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $6.9 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 21.5% from 21.4%. Sequentially, restaurant-level EBITDA margin improved 260 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2019.

* Adjusted net loss/income, adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP net income and operating (loss)/income, respectively, and a discussion of why we consider them useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.

Review of Second Quarter 2019 Operating Results

Consolidated revenues increased $56.0 million, or 73.9%, to $131.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $75.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. All results exclude any contributions from Sullivan’s Steakhouse, which was sold in the third quarter of 2018, and which sale is reflected as discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2018. The increase is due primarily to $21.1 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $28.2 million in contributions from bartaco, which were acquired on June 27, 2018.

Comparable Restaurant Sales

Total Double Eagle Del Frisco’s Grille Barcelona bartaco Comparable Restaurant Sales 0.5% (1.5)% (0.6)% 2.4% 5.5% Customer Counts (1.2)% (3.7)% (8.3)% 4.9% 3.3% Average Check 1.7% 2.2% 7.7% (2.5)% 2.2%

General and administrative costs increased to $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2018. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, general and administrative costs increased to 13.0% from 10.5%. The additional costs were primarily related to the addition of Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco, and additional compensation costs, including stock-based compensation related to growth in the number of restaurant support center and regional management-level personnel to support recent and anticipated growth.

We also incurred non-recurring consulting project costs of $3.4 million, non-recurring legal expense of $2.0 million, reorganization severance costs of $0.5 million, and donations of $0.2 million as set out in the Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Reconciliation attached.

GAAP net loss was $6.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted EBIDTA and restaurant-level EBITDA. Adjusted net (loss) income represents GAAP net loss plus the sum of GAAP income tax expense (benefit), lease termination and closing costs, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, reorganization severance, non-recurring legal expenses, donations, non-recurring corporate expenses, and discontinued operations minus income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 68% during 2019, and (52)% during 2018. We believe that this non-GAAP operating measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors as it excludes certain non-operating related expenditures. Adjusted EBIDTA is calculated by adding back to operating income, pre-opening costs, donations, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, non-recurring legal costs, reorganization severance, lease termination and closing costs, and depreciation and amortization. Restaurant-level EBITDA is calculated by adding back to adjusted EBIDTA general and administrative expenses. We believe that these operating measures also represent useful internal measures of performance. Restaurant-level EBITDA margin represents restaurant-level EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. Adjusted net (loss) income per share represents income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on divestitures and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe that this measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors.

Accordingly, we include these non-GAAP measures so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing our underlying performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these measures as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP measurements. The following tables include a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and operating income to restaurant-level EBITDA.

Recast 2018 Financial Information

The unaudited combined adjusted financial information for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended June 26, 2018 in the following tables represent information derived from financial statements prepared by the former management of Barteca (""Barcelona and bartaco Brands""), recast to align with our fiscal calendar, and historical recast financial information of Del Frisco's Heritage Brands, which represent Double Eagle and Grille, prior to the Barteca Acquisition. This unaudited combined adjusted financial information has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s results of operations actually would have been had the Barteca Acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited combined adjusted financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or results of operations of the combined company and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved from the combined operations.

Adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted EBITDA and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. See the discussion above under ""Non-GAAP Measures"" regarding how we define these measures and why we believe they are useful for investors.

Recast amounts for the 13 weeks ended June 26, 2018 include historical amounts for Barcelona and bartaco Brands, which were acquired during the third quarter of 2018, prior to acquisition. Prior to the Barteca Acquisition, starting in Q4 of 2017 and continuing through the first half of 2018, Barteca management recognized insurance settlement proceeds from a location-specific incident as a reduction to restaurant operating expenses, which therefore increased restaurant-level EBITDA margins by the amount of those proceeds for that period of time. Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company. Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

Reports First Quarter 2019 Results","IRVING, Texas, May 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 26, 2019. We also reiterated guidance for the fiscal year 2019, which is a 53-week period ending on December 31, 2019.



Given the sale of Sullivan’s Steakhouse during fiscal 2018, operating results for Sullivan’s Steakhouse are included in discontinued operations for the 13 weeks ended March 27, 2018. Numbers below for the 13 weeks ended March 27, 2018, are therefore for continuing operations unless otherwise stated.

Key Highlights from the 13-Week First Quarter 2019 Compared to the 13-Week First Quarter 2018 Include:

Consolidated revenues increased 64.1% to $120.4 million from $73.3 million due primarily to $17.4 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $20.6 million in contributions from bartaco.



Total comparable restaurant sales increased 1.3%.

GAAP net loss of $18.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $0.0 million, or $0.00 per diluted share.

Adjusted net loss* of $3.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income* of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.



Adjusted EBITDA* increased 5.0% to $7.1 million from $6.8 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 330 basis points to 5.9% from 9.2%.



GAAP operating loss of $11.8 million, compared to GAAP operating income of $0.3 million.

Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased 57.9% to $22.7 million from $14.4 million due primarily to $3.6 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $4.3 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA margin decreased 70 basis points to 18.9% from 19.6%, primarily due to inefficiencies from new restaurant openings.



* Adjusted net loss/income, adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP net income and operating (loss)/income, respectively, and a discussion of why we consider them useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.

Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer of Del Frisco's, said, “We experienced a sequential improvement in comparable sales across all four brands during the first quarter of 2019. Barcelona and bartaco delivered low and mid-single digit growth, respectively, Del Frisco’s Grille was slightly positive, while the Double Eagle was only modestly negative, and would also have been positive without planned sales transfer from the Boston Seaport restaurant to Boston Back Bay opening last summer which impacted comparable sales by 110 basis points. The Double Eagle and Del Frisco’s Grille both continue to capitalize on their significant opportunities to generate private dining sales, which grew 4.6% and 2.0%, respectively on a comparable basis. We attribute their traction to improved banquet menu offerings, flawless execution, and effectiveness in building relationships with local businesses and luxury hotels through impactful marketing campaigns.”

Abdallah continued, “Our 2018 new restaurant openings and our latest four openings during the first quarter of 2019 are collectively off to strong starts and we are building lasting relationships with our guests through unforgettable dining experiences while positioning these restaurants to hit their three-year ROIC targets of 35% to 40%. However, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter last year, new restaurant inefficiencies weighed heavily on our results at Double Eagle and bartaco where we have seen particularly significant recent growth.”

Abdallah added, “During the first quarter of 2019, our 21 non-comparable restaurants, representing over 25% of our total restaurant base, had a 270 basis point impact to restaurant-level EBITDA margins. This compared to a 290 basis point impact from non-comparable restaurants during the fourth quarter last year. The new restaurant inefficiencies were most notable in the Double Eagle and bartaco, which have experienced the fastest growth recently, with non-comparable restaurants having a 520 basis point impact on restaurant level EBITDA in each brand. With new restaurant margins improving from period to period as they mature and six of our planned seven to eight new restaurants opened thus far, we anticipate the impact of new restaurant inefficiencies on our total restaurant-level EBITDA margins to begin moderating in the second half of 2019.”

Abdallah concluded, “The Barcelona and bartaco integration is nearly complete and we intend to finalize the process ahead of the original 12-18 month timeframe. All of our brands are now online with our new Human Resources and payroll system and we expect to transition Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco to our new accounting system next month. We will begin to recognize more of the $10 million in integration benefits, up from the original $3 million to $5 million, in the second half of this year when the transition of back office systems and support is complete. The full amount will be realized by 2020 or 2021.”

Review of First Quarter 2019 Operating Results

Consolidated revenues increased $47.1 million, or 64.1%, to $120.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $73.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. All results exclude any contributions from Sullivan’s Steakhouse, which was sold in the third quarter of 2018, and which sale is reflected as discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2018. The increase is due primarily to $17.4 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $20.6 million in contributions from bartaco, which were acquired on June 27, 2018.

Comparable Restaurant Sales

Total Double Eagle Del Frisco’s Grille Barcelona bartaco Comparable Restaurant Sales 1.3 % (0.4 )% 0.2 % 3.7 % 6.7 % Customer Counts (0.6 )% (1.5 )% (6.9 )% 3.6 % 5.5 % Average Check 1.9 % 1.1 % 7.1 % 0.1 % 1.2 %

As a percentage of consolidated revenues, general and administrative costs increased to 13.6% from 10.6%. The additional costs were primarily related to the addition of Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco, and additional compensation costs, including stock-based compensation related to growth in the number of restaurant support center and regional management-level personnel to support recent and anticipated growth. Included in this general and administrative costs total were also $0.4 million of non-recurring legal expenses and $0.4 million of non-recurring corporate expenses as set out in the Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Reconciliation attached. Finally we incurred approximately $0.5 million in costs related to our annual General Managers conference in the first quarter of 2019. We expect that full general and administrative cost synergies from the Barteca acquisition will only be realized beginning in the second half of 2019 as we complete the back office integration.

GAAP net loss was $18.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to GAAP net income of $0.0 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018.

Adjusted net loss* was $3.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to adjusted net income* of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. Adjustments include costs totaling $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2019 consisting of consulting project costs of $4.5 million, lease termination and closing costs of $2.9 million, reorganization severance costs of $0.3 million, the aforementioned non-recurring legal and corporate expenses each totaling $0.4 million respectively, and a change in tax benefit of $6.4 million.

Adjusted EBITDA* increased 5.0% to $7.1 million from $6.8 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 330 basis points to 5.9% from 9.2%.

Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased $8.3 million, or 57.9%, to $22.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to $3.6 million in contributions from Barcelona and $4.3 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA* decreased to 18.9% from 19.6% primarily due to inefficiencies from new restaurant openings.

Recent Development

A Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse restaurant opened in Century City, CA during the first quarter of 2019.

A Barcelona Wine Bar opened in Charlotte, NC during the first quarter of 2019 and in Raleigh, NC during the second quarter of 2019.

A bartaco restaurant opened in each of Madison, WI and King of Prussia, PA during the first quarter of 2019 and in Deerfield, IL during the second quarter of 2019.

Fiscal Year 2019 Guidance & Long-Term Growth Outlook

The following statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to the statement below regarding Forward-Looking Statements and our recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition.

For the 53-week fiscal year 2019, which ends on December 31, 2019, we are providing the following outlook.

Total comparable restaurant sales of 0% to 1.5%.

Seven to eight restaurant openings, consisting of one Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse, two to three Barcelona Wine Bars, and three to four bartaco restaurants. Six restaurants have already opened year-to-date.



Restaurant-level EBITDA** of 20.0% to 22.0% of consolidated revenues.

General and administrative costs of approximately $53 million to $55 million, which excludes items we consider non-recurring in nature.



Pre-opening expenses of $5 million to $7 million.



Net capital expenditures, after tenant allowances, of $25 million to $35 million.



Adjusted EBITDA** of $58 million to $66 million.

** Restaurant-level EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

By the end of fiscal year 2023, we are targeting generation on an annual basis of at least $800 million in consolidated revenues and $130 million in adjusted EBITDA**. To achieve these long-term targets, we would need to satisfy the following key annual goals:

Consolidated revenue growth of at least 10%.



Total comparable restaurant sales growth of 0% to 2%.



Total net restaurant growth of 10% to 12% annually.



Maintaining strong restaurant-level EBITDA** margins.



General and administrative cost leverage.



Adjusted EBITDA** growth of at least 15%.

We are also targeting net debt to adjusted EBITDA** of approximately 3x by the end of fiscal year 2021 and 2x by the end of fiscal year 2023.

**A reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and GAAP measures for adjusted EBITDA, restaurant-level EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to the potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures and other structural changes or their probable significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.

Non-GAAP Measures

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted EBIDTA and restaurant-level EBITDA. Adjusted net (loss) income represents GAAP net loss plus the sum of GAAP income tax expense (benefit), lease termination and closing costs, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, reorganization severance, non-recurring legal expenses, donations, non-recurring corporate expenses, and discontinued operations minus income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 69% during 2019, and 4% during 2018. We believe that this non-GAAP operating measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors as it excludes certain non-operating related expenditures. Adjusted EBIDTA is calculated by adding back to operating income, pre-opening costs, donations, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, non-recurring legal costs, reorganization severance, lease termination and closing costs, and depreciation and amortization. Restaurant-level EBITDA is calculated by adding back to adjusted EBIDTA general and administrative expenses. We believe that these operating measures also represent useful internal measures of performance. Restaurant-level EBITDA margin represents restaurant-level EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. Adjusted net (loss) income per share represents income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on divestitures and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe that this measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors.

Accordingly, we include these non-GAAP measures so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing our underlying performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these measures as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP measurements. The following tables include a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and operating income to restaurant-level EBITDA.

(2) Prior to the Barteca Acquisition, starting in Q4 of 2017 and continuing through the first half of 2018, Barteca management recognized insurance settlement proceeds from a location-specific incident as a reduction to restaurant operating expenses, which therefore increased restaurant-level EBITDA margins by the amount of those proceeds for that period of time. Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company. Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company. Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

New Spin-Off Record Date Set for July 15, 2019



MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., July 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND) , a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, and Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today provided an update on the planned merger and spin-off transaction announced on January 7, 2019. The respective special stockholder meetings will be held today, July 9, 2019, to consider approval of the proposed merger and spin-off transaction. Subject to approval by holders of record of the companies at the respective special stockholder meetings, MYnd will issue a number of shares of common stock to the current Emmaus shareholders, which will result in MYnd shareholders retaining 5.9% of the fully diluted shares of the 'New Emmaus' post-closing and a pro rata distribution of one share of Telemynd’s common stock for each share of MYnd common stock held at the end of trading on July 16, 2019. The companies have set a new Spin-Off Record Date of July 15, 2019 in order to comply with certain NASDAQ and DTC requirements. Those individuals who hold shares at the close of trading on the 16th of July will receive the Telemynd dividend. MYnd shares will trade ex-dividend on July 17, which means that persons who purchase MYnd shares on July 17 will not receive shares of Telemynd.

It is expected that on July 16 and July 17, the necessary steps will occur to spin off Telemynd with the current MYnd assets, effectuate the merger and any adjustments needed to meet NASDAQ listing standards and commence trading on July 18, 2019 under the new symbol “EMMA.”

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “We are very grateful for this opportunity to merge with MYnd Analytics. The anticipated listing on Nasdaq via the merger with MYnd Analytics is an important step to maximize value for shareholders. We look forward to sharing with the public markets our progress on the market acceptance of Endari, which is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years and older. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other major clinical indications such as diverticulosis.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are pleased with the progress of the merger and spin-off transaction, which remains on track to close before the end of this month, subject to approval of shareholders. We believe this transaction will drive significant value for all shareholders, and we will provide further updates following the respective shareholder meetings.”

Endari addresses a $3 billion worldwide market

MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., Jan. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND), a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, today announced that it has entered into a definitive stock-for-stock merger agreement with Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Emmaus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MYnd Analytics in exchange for MYnd Analytics’ issuance of common stock to Emmaus shareholders and other equity holders. The exchange ratio will result in Emmaus securityholders owning approximately 94% of the MYnd Analytics’ common stock on a fully diluted basis after the merger. It is anticipated that the surviving company will change its name to Emmaus and receive a new ticker symbol to reflect the name change. The company expects to meet all applicable requirements for initial listing upon completion of the merger and, therefore, expects to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval from the shareholders of each company and Nasdaq approval. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as a financial advisor to Emmaus in connection with this transaction.

In connection with the transaction, MYnd Analytics intends to transfer all of its assets (including cash and its equity interest in Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services, LLC) and liabilities into its wholly-owned subsidiary, MYnd Analytics California, and to distribute the shares of MYnd Analytics California to MYnd Analytics’ shareholders as of a record date prior to the merger, which will be set prior to the merger effective time. MYnd Analytics expects that the MYnd Analytics California subsidiary, following the spinoff, will commence trading as an independent company at a date to be announced. Under the leadership of its new CEO, Patrick Herguth, the MYnd Analytics California spin off intends to continue operating, integrating and growing its technology-enabled telepsychiatry and teletherapy businesses in order to provide enhanced access to behavioral health services, improve patient outcomes and help lower the costs associated with behavioral health issues. MYnd-Arcadian customers include major health plans, health systems, and community-based organizations. The parties do not expect there to be any disruption to the existing business or customers.

Emmaus is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, including those in the rare and orphan disease categories. Its lead prescription product, Endari, demonstrated positive clinical results in a completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell disease and received FDA approval in July 2017. Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. The results of the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on July 19th, 2018.

Emmaus launched Endari in the United States in early 2018 and has experienced strong market uptake. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Additionally, Emmaus has distribution agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors, making Endari available to selected pharmacies nationwide.

Outside the United States, the treatment is currently available through an Early Access Program for sickle cell disease patients that have exhausted other treatment options. Emmaus is currently in the process of seeking marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency for its medication. Emmaus has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA which provides protection from competition in the United States and Orphan Medicinal designation from the European Commission for protection in the European Union.

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “The merger with MYnd Analytics, and concurrent Nasdaq listing, will be a major milestone for the company, and builds on our recent progress, including the FDA approval of Endari, the publication of our Phase 3 results in The New England Journal of Medicine , Medicaid coverage, the addition of major pharmaceutical distributors, and a presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 Annual Meeting. Just as important as these accomplishments was the launch and market acceptance of Endari – the first medication (FDA approved) for sickle cell disease in almost 20 years. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other clinical indications such as diverticulosis. Through this merger, we believe we can maximize value for shareholders and we are grateful to MYnd for this opportunity.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are excited to announce this definitive merger agreement with Emmaus, whereby the MYnd shareholders will own equity in Emmaus, and upon our expected spin-off, will continue to own 100% of the predictive analytics and telemedicine business, which we expect to begin operations as a new standalone public company. We are quite encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to further integrating and accelerating the growth of our offerings under Patrick Herguth’s leadership. We plan to provide further details on the new operational direction, branding, and growth strategy in the coming weeks and months.”

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle Cell Disease is an orphan disease with significant unmet medical needs, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide.

About Endari

Indication

Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.

II-VI has agreed with SAMR that it will operate separately, for a period expected to be three years, the wavelength selective switch business of Finisar. The clearance decision from SAMR satisfies the closing condition set forth in the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger regarding the receipt of antitrust approvals. II-VI expects the closing of its acquisition of Finisar (the “Merger”) to occur on or about September 24, 2019.



In accordance with the merger agreement governing the Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), holders of Finisar common stock and holders of certain restricted stock units issued by Finisar (collectively, the “Voting Securities”) have previously been provided the opportunity to elect the form of Merger consideration they wished to receive for each Voting Security they hold, being either (i) $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration”). The deadline for that election was July 15, 2019 (the “Election Deadline”), and the total amount of cash and II-VI Common Stock to be paid in the aggregate by II-VI is fixed. Holders of Voting Securities are deemed to have made no election if they failed to make an election, or revoked a prior election without making a new election, by the Election Deadline, or if their election materials were not received in proper form by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”) prior to the Election Deadline.

Holders of Voting Securities who made no election, or have validly withdrawn their election, are deemed to have elected the Mixed Consideration. Holders of Voting Securities who have validly made, and not previously withdrawn, an election prior to the Election Deadline regarding the form of merger consideration they wish to receive in the Merger will have until 5:00 p.m., New York time, on September 20, 2019 to withdraw their election if they wish to receive the Mixed Consideration. All other holders of Voting Securities who have validly made an election that is not so withdrawn will receive either the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration they have elected, in each case prorated as described below.

The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to automatic proration so that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of II-VI Common Stock paid to all holders of Voting Securities as a group will not change as a result of these elections.

Establishing the date of the Election Deadline is not intended, however, to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (“SAMR”).



To make an election, all Finisar stockholders who have not previously made their cash, stock, or mixed consideration elections, or who desire to revoke a prior election and make a new election, must submit their properly completed and signed election forms with respect to their shares, together with all required documents and materials set forth in the election form and the instructions thereto, to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), the exchange agent for the Merger, by the Election Deadline. Finisar stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may be subject to an earlier deadline and should read carefully the instructions from their bank, broker or nominee regarding making elections for their shares. Finisar stockholders with questions should contact AST at (877) 248-6417 or (718) 921-8317.

In accordance with the previously announced merger agreement, Finisar stockholders may elect to receive either $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration”), 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI, no par value (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Election Consideration”), or a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Election Consideration”). Finisar stockholders may also choose to make no election with respect to their shares, and will be deemed to have made no election with respect to their shares if they fail to make an election, revoke a prior election without making a new election, or their election materials are not received in proper form by AST prior to the Election Deadline, in which case such stockholders will receive the Mixed Election Consideration. The Cash Election Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration are subject to automatic proration adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement such that the aggregate merger consideration paid to all Finisar stockholders as a group will consist of approximately 60% cash and 40% II-VI Common Stock (assuming a II-VI Common Stock per share price equal to the closing price as of November 8, 2018), as further described in the merger agreement and the joint proxy statement/prospectus provided to Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders in connection with the special meeting of Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders, each of which was held on March 26, 2019.

Under the terms of the merger agreement for the Merger, the deadline for Finisar stockholders to submit their elections is to be 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the date which the parties to the merger agreement agree is as near as practicable to two business days prior to the closing date of the Merger. The Election Deadline has been chosen by II-VI and Finisar in accordance with the merger agreement in order to provide sufficient notice to enable Finisar stockholders to elect their preferred form of merger consideration, while still enabling the parties to consummate the Merger within two business days following the satisfaction of the various conditions to the Merger. The date selected for the Election Deadline does not, however, in any way guarantee or indicate that the Merger will actually close two business days after the Election Deadline, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or certainty of the closing of the Merger. The date of the Election Deadline also is not intended to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by SAMR, and the parties continue to anticipate that SAMR’s approval of the Merger will be received mid calendar year 2019. It is possible, however, that factors outside the control of the parties could result in SAMR’s approval being received at a different time or not at all. II-VI and Finisar reserve the right to set a revised election deadline.

The deadline for making that election was 5:00 p.m., New York time, on July 15, 2019 (the “Election Deadline”).



Based on available information as of the Election Deadline, the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Finisar common stock and Participating RSUs (collectively, the “Voting Securities”) was 120,730,839. In accordance with the merger agreement governing the Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), holders of Voting Securities could have elected to receive (i) $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration”). Holders of Voting Securities are deemed to have made no election if they failed to make an election, or revoked a prior election without making a new election, or if their election materials were not received in proper form by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), prior to the Election Deadline. Holders of Voting Securities who made no election are deemed to have elected the Mixed Consideration. The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to automatic proration so that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of II-VI Common Stock paid to all holders of Voting Securities as a group will not change as a result of these elections. It will consist of approximately 60% cash and 40% II-VI Common Stock (assuming a per share price of II-VI Common Stock equal to the closing price as of November 8, 2018, which was $46.88 per share), as further described in the Merger Agreement and in the joint proxy statement/prospectus provided to Finisar and II-VI shareholders in connection with the special meetings of Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders, each of which was held on March 26, 2019.

The election results were as follows:

Holders of 96,820,703 Voting Securities, or approximately 80.2% of the Voting Securities, elected to receive the Cash Consideration;



Holders of 1,716,027 Voting Securities, or approximately 1.4% of the Voting Securities, elected to receive the Stock Consideration;



Holders of 3,205,674 Voting Securities, or approximately 2.7% of the Voting Securities, affirmatively elected to receive the Mixed Consideration; and



Holders of 18,988,435 Voting Securities, or approximately 15.7% of the Voting Securities, made no election and therefore are deemed to have elected to receive the Mixed Consideration.

The final allocations of the consideration payable in connection with the Merger will be calculated using the formulas set forth in the Merger Agreement. The calculation of the applicable proration adjustments with respect to the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration is based, in part, on the number of outstanding Voting Securities as of the effective time of the Merger, and also will change as a result of Finisar stockholders transferring their Finisar shares or withdrawing their consideration election. Accordingly, the applicable proration adjustments cannot be calculated at this time and may differ from the results that would be obtained if information as of the Election Deadline were used to calculate the proration adjustments.

As previously announced, the date of the Election Deadline was not intended to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (“SAMR”). II-VI and Finisar continue to anticipate that SAMR’s approval of the Merger will be received mid calendar year 2019. It is possible, however, that factors outside the control of the parties could result in SAMR’s approval being received at a different time or not at all, and neither II-VI nor Finisar are able to estimate accurately when that will be. Consequently, Finisar and II-VI are permitting holders of Voting Securities who made an election prior to the Election Deadline to withdraw some or all of the Voting Securities as to which they made an election in order to transfer or sell their shares or for any other reason. Any withdrawal of Voting Securities after the Election Deadline will result in a deemed Mixed Consideration election with respect to such Voting Securities. Holders of Voting Securities will continue to be able to withdraw their elections until the time that Finisar and II-VI provide notice that election withdrawals no longer will be permitted in anticipation of consummating the Merger. II-VI and Finisar currently expect that there will be no additional election period and, once an election has been withdrawn, a subsequent election will not be permitted with respect to the related Voting Securities. Elections made by holders of Voting Securities prior to the Election Deadline that are not validly withdrawn will remain in effect.

In order to withdraw an existing election, record holders of Voting Securities must submit their properly completed and signed withdrawal forms with respect to their Voting Securities, together with all required documents and materials, to AST, the exchange agent for the Merger. Finisar stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee should contact that bank, broker or nominee for the appropriate instructions with respect to how withdraw Voting Securities from their existing elections. Finisar stockholders with questions should contact AST at (877) 248-6417 or (718) 921-8317.

_____________

(a) In evaluating the operating performance of Finisar’s business, Finisar management utilizes financial measures that exclude certain charges and credits required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, that are considered by management to be outside of Finisar’s core ongoing operating results. A reconciliation of Finisar’s non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as additional related information, can be found under the heading “Finisar Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Revenue Details for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2020:

Revenues for datacom applications decreased by $19.4 million, or (8.9)%, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily as the result of a decline in VCSELs arrays for 3D applications due to lower demand resulting from the timing of the new product cycle of a key customer, as well as lower sales of fibre channel transceivers.



Revenues for telecom applications decreased by $5.6 million, or (6.2)%, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of a decline in sales of wavelength selective switches.

FINISAR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES



In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Finisar provides the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP income and non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental information regarding Finisar’s operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges of a non-cash nature or that occur relatively infrequently and/or that management considers to be outside of our ongoing core operating results. Management believes that tracking non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share provides management and the investment community with valuable insight into our ongoing core current operations, our ability to generate cash and the underlying business trends that are affecting our performance. These non-GAAP measures are used by both management and our Board of Directors, along with the comparable GAAP information, in evaluating our current performance and planning our future business activities. In particular, management finds it useful to exclude non-cash charges in order to better correlate our operating activities with our ability to generate cash from operations and to exclude certain cash charges as a means of more accurately predicting our liquidity requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when used in conjunction with our GAAP financial information, also allow investors to better evaluate our financial performance in comparison to other periods and to other companies in our industry.

In calculating non-GAAP gross profit in this release, we have excluded the following items from cost of revenues in applicable periods in this release:

Amortization of acquired technology (non-cash charges related to technology obtained in acquisitions);

Stock-based compensation expense (non-cash charges);

Impairment of long-lived/intangible assets (non-cash charges);

Reduction in force costs and other restructuring charges (non-core cash charges);

Acquisition related retention payments (non-core cash charges); and

Inventory write-off related to discontinued products (non-cash charges).

In calculating non-GAAP operating income in this release, we have excluded the same items to the extent they are classified as operating expenses, and have also excluded the following items in applicable periods in this release:

Discontinued product services fees (non-core cash charges);

Acquisition related costs (non-core cash charges);

Litigation settlements and resolutions and related costs (non-core cash charges);

Amortization of purchased intangibles (non-cash charges);

Start-up cash costs related to our Sherman VCSEL fab until we begin commercial production; and

Impairment of long-lived assets/intangible assets (non-cash charges).

In calculating non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share in this release, we have also excluded the following items in applicable periods in this release:

Imputed interest expenses on convertible debt (non-cash charges);

Imputed interest related to restructuring (non-cash charges);

Other interest income (non-core benefits);

Gains and losses on sales of assets and other miscellaneous (non-cash losses and cash gains related to the periodic disposal of assets no longer required for current activities);

Dollar denominated foreign exchange transaction losses (gains) (non-cash charges or benefits); and

Amortization of debt issuance costs (non-cash charges).

In addition, in this release we have adjusted non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share for the difference between GAAP income taxes and non-GAAP income taxes.

A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information to the corresponding GAAP information is set forth below:

Third Fiscal Quarter 2019 Results:

Interest income increased by $0.1 million, or 0.5%, due to a $4.3 million increase in the weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing portfolio, partially offset by the decrease in the weighted average yield quarter over quarter. Other income increased by $0.3 million, or 21.3%, quarter over quarter, primarily driven by prepayment fees received associated with the exit of IA Tech, LLC. Total expenses increased by 2.6% period over period, primarily due to an increase in incentive fees due to higher pre-incentive fee net investment income.

Net Investment Income for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was $6.2 million, an increase of 3.3% as compared to the prior quarter, or $0.21 per share.

The Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was $8.9 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to a net increase of $9.3 million, or $0.33 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. The current quarter increase was primarily due to $3.6 million of net unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by an $0.8 million net realized loss on investments.

Subsequent Events: Subsequent to June 30, 2019, the following significant events occurred:

Portfolio Activity: In July 2019, our debt investment in PIC 360, LLC was repaid at par for net proceeds of $2.6 million. In August 2019, we invested an additional $5.0 million in Sea Link International IRB, Inc, an existing portfolio company, through secured second lien debt.

Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Common Share Distribution per Series 2024 Term Preferred Share July 22, 2019 July 31, 2019 $ 0.07 $ 0.125 August 20, 2019 August 30, 2019 0.07 0.125 September 17, 2019 September 30, 2019 0.07 0.125 Total for the Quarter $ 0.21 $ 0.375

Comments from Gladstone Capital’s President, Bob Marcotte: “We entered the quarter well prepared for the elevated level of prepayment activity we experienced which allowed us to increase our assets and net interest income for the period while higher prepayment and other fee income drove much of the investment income increase for the quarter. Notwithstanding the competitive market conditions for senior debt, we are continuing to outpace prepayments and prudently grow our investment portfolio. In the near term we will continue to focus our efforts on deploying our approximate $75 million of incremental investment capacity to grow our core net interest earnings and enhance the returns to our shareholders.”

Invested $49.9 million in six new portfolio companies and $9.4 million in existing portfolio companies. Received $8.9 million in repayments including the payoff of two debt investments at par. Debt Issuance: In November 2018, we completed a public offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023, inclusive of the overallotment, for net proceeds of $55.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

In November 2018, we completed a public offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023, inclusive of the overallotment, for net proceeds of $55.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Distributions and Dividends: For each of October, November, and December 2018, paid monthly distributions to common stockholders ($0.07 per common share) and monthly dividends to preferred stockholders ($0.125 per share of the Company’s 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock).

First Fiscal Quarter 2019 Results:

Interest income increased by $0.8 million, or 7.7%, primarily due to increases in both the weighted average yield and the weighted average balance of our interest bearing portfolio quarter over quarter. Other income decreased by $0.2 million, quarter over quarter due to a decrease in dividend income. Total expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 10.6%, compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in interest expense driven by an increase in the average debt outstanding used to fund the new investments made during the quarter ended December 31, 2018.

Net Investment Income for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was $6.0 million, an increase of 1.4% as compared to the prior quarter, or $0.21 per share.

The Net Decrease in Net Assets Resulting from Operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was $3.7 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $9.9 million, or $0.35 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The current quarter decrease was driven primarily by $26.9 million of net realized loss from the restructure of Francis Drilling Fluids, Ltd. (“FDF”), partially offset by $17.2 million of net unrealized appreciation during the period associated with the reversal of accumulated unrealized depreciation on FDF.

Subsequent Events: Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the following significant events occurred:

Portfolio Activity: In January 2019, our investment in Merlin International, Inc. paid off, generating net cash proceeds of $20.9 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $20.0 million at par and success fee income of $0.6 million and a prepayment fee of $0.3 million.

Comments from Gladstone Capital’s President, Bob Marcotte: “Strong net originations and higher average investment yields lifted our interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 to a new record, and position us well to absorb potential prepayments and continue to grow our net investment income. The conclusion of the restructuring of FDF was difficult; however, the balance of the portfolio is performing well despite the valuation erosion associated with the liquidity sell-off in the syndicated loan market at December 31, 2018 much of which has already recovered. The plan for the balance of fiscal 2019 is to continue to drive interest income by remaining reasonably fully invested while generating higher fee income associated with increased prepayments to enable us to enhance the returns to our shareholders in the coming quarters.”

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Apollo Funds separately enter into a definitive agreement with Snapfish

NEW YORK, June 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Apollo”) (NYSE: APO), a leading global alternative investment manager, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Shutterfly, Inc. (NASDAQ: SFLY) (“Shutterfly” or the “Company”), a leading retailer and manufacturing platform dedicated to helping capture, preserve, and share life’s important moments, for $51.00 per share in cash, or enterprise value of approximately $2.7 billion.

The $51.00 per share cash consideration represents a premium of 31% when compared to Shutterfly’s unaffected closing stock price of $38.91 on April 23, 2019, the last trading day before a media report was published speculating that Apollo Funds were considering a bid for the Company. The Shutterfly Board of Directors unanimously approved the agreement with the Apollo Funds and recommends that Shutterfly stockholders vote in favor of the transaction.

“We are extremely excited for our funds to acquire Shutterfly,” said David Sambur, Senior Partner at Apollo. “At a time when billions of photos are taken every day, Shutterfly has led the charge as a pioneer of personalized photo products and school photography, helping consumers capture, preserve and share life’s most important moments. We look forward to working with Shutterfly’s talented employees and supporting further investments in technology to drive the continued growth and success of the business.”

Shutterfly Transaction Details

The Shutterfly transaction is expected to close by early fourth quarter 2019. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Shutterfly shareholders and receipt of approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The Shutterfly transaction is not conditioned on the closing of the Apollo Funds’ transaction with Snapfish.

Upon completion of the Shutterfly transaction, Shutterfly will become a privately held company, and its shares will no longer be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Snapfish Transaction

Simultaneously, Apollo announced that the Apollo Funds entered into a definitive agreement to combine Snapfish, LLC (“Snapfish”), an internet-based retailer of photography products, with Shutterfly. Upon the closing of the Snapfish transaction, the Snapfish owners will become significant minority owners in the combined Shutterfly and Snapfish business.

The Snapfish transaction is subject to specified closing conditions, including the completion of the Apollo Funds’ acquisition of Shutterfly and receipt of approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The Snapfish transaction is expected to close simultaneously with the Shutterfly acquisition.

Neil Cohen, Chairman of Snapfish and CEO of District Photo, Inc., commented, “We look forward to working with the Apollo Funds. The Apollo Funds bring substantial financial resources as we continue to invest in innovation, as well as valuable strategic perspectives to drive growth over the coming years. We are committed to supporting the company and continuing our relationship as a fulfillment partner.”

“We are thrilled to partner with two pioneers of the photo personalization industry in these innovative transactions,” said David Sambur, Senior Partner at Apollo. “We are confident that this transaction will create an opportunity for innovation and continued growth in the photo and personalized photo products industry. We are excited to work with Neil and the Snapfish team in this transaction, and to benefit from their market expertise after three generations in the photo product business. We believe that both companies will be better positioned to operate in a competitive marketplace through their enhanced ability to invest in product innovation to deliver the best consumer experience.”

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced the dosing of the first Chinese patient in its on-going global pivotal Phase 3 trial of Xynomic’s abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Dr. Jun Guo, Professor and Medical Director at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, is the leading principal investigator for this trial in China.

According to US International Trade Administration, China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, forecasted to grow from $108 billion in 2015 to $167 billion by 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. Total public and private healthcare expenditure reached $640 billion in 2015 and is expected to almost double to $1.1 trillion by 2020.

A global randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway of abexinostat + pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Currently, this trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and South Korea. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of RCC in Q1’2019.

“There are approximately 46,900 new cases of kidney cancer patients in China per year, according to Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Majority of patients develop resistance to pazopanib or other current standard-of-care therapies. Combining abexinostat with pazopanib has shown to reverse drug resistance in a Phase 1b study conducted by University of California, San Francisco and could significantly prolong patients' progression-free-survival time. We are excited to start the China arm of this on-going global trial and look forward to working with Dr. Jun Guo and other leading China kidney cancer specialists.” Mr. Y. Mark Xu, Chairman and CEO of Xynomic, commented.

In addition, Dr. Kapilan Rajagopalan has joined Xynomic as the Medical Monitor for clinical development. Prior to joining Xynomic, from 2016 to 2019 Dr. Rajagopalan worked as a Safety Case Manager and a Safety Operations Physician for Tata Consultancy Services, managing various pharmaceutical projects for Roche and Bayer. From 2014 to 2015, Dr. Rajagopalan was a MD/MBA intern at Humana. From 2012 to 2013, Dr. Rajagopalan was a family medicine resident physician at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. We believe that Dr. Rajagopalan’s experience in performing medical review for oncology pharmaceutical products and his MD education in the USA will enhance Xynomic’s medical monitoring function. Dr. Rajagopalan holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Cincinnati, graduating with Summa Cum Laude honors, a MBA from the University of Louisville with distinction, and a MD degree from the University of Cincinnati.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced encouraging interim data from an ongoing Phase 1b study of its lead candidate abexinostat, an orally dosed, hydroxamic acid-based small molecule histone deacetylase (“HDAC”) inhibitor , in combination with Keytruda®, for the treatment of multiple solid tumors. The trial is being conducted at University of California, San Francisco. The interim data will also be presented at the 3rd World-China Immunotherapy & Gene Therapy Congress 2019 to be held in Beijing from August 30th to 31st, 2019.

This Phase 1b trial explores abexinostat in combination with pembrolizumab (trade name Keytruda®) to treat patients with prior progression on Keytruda® or other immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments. A total of 7 patients with prior progression on anti-PD1/PD-L1 treatment were enrolled in the Dose Escalation portion of the study. Tumor types included melanoma (N = 3), urothelial carcinoma (N = 2), neuroendocrine carcinoma (N = 1), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (N = 1). The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 3. Median age of patient population was 61. In the two dose levels tested (abexinostat 30 mg/m2 and 45 mg/m2 on days 1-4, 8-11 in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1), there were no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximally tolerated dose was not reached, and the recommended Phase 2 dose is abexinostat 45 mg/m2 BID on days 1-4, 8-11 of a 21 day cycle in conjunction with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1. There were no treatment-related grade ≥ 3 or serious adverse events. The most common Grade 1-2 adverse events were diarrhea (N = 3), rash (n = 2), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), and dysgeusia (n = 1). 2 out of 7 patients (29%) experienced stable disease for > 6 months. 1 of these 2 patients has pembrolizumab-refractory urothelial carcinoma and remains on treatment for 6+ months with ongoing 20% reduction in tumor size from baseline.

Enrollment in Dose Expansion portion of this trial is ongoing to ascertain the response rate and disease control rate across tumor types. The trial is targeting to enroll a total of approximately 42 patients in the U.S.

“Abexinostat is known mechanistically to have potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We are very pleased with the interim data reported today by UCSF, a world leader in solid tumor clinical research. The data reported today indicate the combination of abexinostat with Keytruda® could be safe and well tolerated and there is preliminary evidence demonstrating efficacy and the potential to reverse resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. We expect to report additional data at a scientific conference early next year.” Mr. Y. Mark Xu, Chairman and CEO of Xynomic commented.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced the dosing of the first Chinese patient in its on-going global pivotal Phase 3 trial of Xynomic’s abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Dr. Jun Guo, Professor and Medical Director at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, is the leading principal investigator for this trial in China.

According to US International Trade Administration, China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, forecasted to grow from $108 billion in 2015 to $167 billion by 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. Total public and private healthcare expenditure reached $640 billion in 2015 and is expected to almost double to $1.1 trillion by 2020.

A global randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway of abexinostat + pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Currently, this trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and South Korea. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of RCC in Q1’2019.

“There are approximately 46,900 new cases of kidney cancer patients in China per year, according to Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Majority of patients develop resistance to pazopanib or other current standard-of-care therapies. Combining abexinostat with pazopanib has shown to reverse drug resistance in a Phase 1b study conducted by University of California, San Francisco and could significantly prolong patients' progression-free-survival time. We are excited to start the China arm of this on-going global trial and look forward to working with Dr. Jun Guo and other leading China kidney cancer specialists.” Mr. Y. Mark Xu, Chairman and CEO of Xynomic, commented.

In addition, Dr. Kapilan Rajagopalan has joined Xynomic as the Medical Monitor for clinical development. Prior to joining Xynomic, from 2016 to 2019 Dr. Rajagopalan worked as a Safety Case Manager and a Safety Operations Physician for Tata Consultancy Services, managing various pharmaceutical projects for Roche and Bayer. From 2014 to 2015, Dr. Rajagopalan was a MD/MBA intern at Humana. From 2012 to 2013, Dr. Rajagopalan was a family medicine resident physician at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. We believe that Dr. Rajagopalan’s experience in performing medical review for oncology pharmaceutical products and his MD education in the USA will enhance Xynomic’s medical monitoring function. Dr. Rajagopalan holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Cincinnati, graduating with Summa Cum Laude honors, a MBA from the University of Louisville with distinction, and a MD degree from the University of Cincinnati.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

PlayTime with KittyPlays, a monthly series that will debut in the spring of 2019, will be a live esports entertainment and variety show, featuring top influencers and celebrity guests; competitive gameplay across a range of titles and genres; fan interaction and participation; and unique commentary on current news and esports issues, all streamed in front of a live studio audience at HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas.

“I’m so excited to take my stream to the live stage and interact with my community in person,” said Michaela. “We are going to have an incredible lineup of guests on the show to talk, play and have some fun, and I can’t wait to share this experience with everyone in the arena and those watching on the live stream.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays will be the first of multiple original content debuts planned for release by Allied Esports this year. As previously announced, Allied Esports and its sister company, the World Poker Tour®, both currently owned by Ourgame Holdings International, will be acquired, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, by Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: BRAC), to form Allied Esports Entertainment. Creating premier live experiences, multiplatform content and interactive online services that reach and engage a worldwide audience of players and viewers, is a central part of Allied Esports Entertainment’s mission.

“Partnering with talented and popular streamers like KittyPlays to create fresh, interactive events and content is a key component of our growth strategy,” said Frank Ng, current CEO of Ourgame and expected CEO of Allied Esports Entertainment. “PlayTime is an outstanding kickoff to a year of what we intend to be a much larger, comprehensive content offering to come from Allied Esports, and we’re confident that Kristen’s magnetic personality and skill will carry this concept far beyond our own lofty expectations.”

PlayTime with KittyPlays, which will be produced by Allied Esports with Michaela serving as co-executive producer, will utilize Allied Esports’ multimillion-dollar broadcast studio and arena in the HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, featuring a two-story LED video wall, two-dozen cameras, wired player comms, and a dedicated control room for game observers called The Observatory, to create an unparalleled live experience and compelling streamed and post-produced content that will be available to viewers following each episode. Allied Esports has produced a number of original productions over the past year, including Ninja Vegas ’18 starring Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, which at the time set a new Twitch record for viewers on an individual stream and garnered 2.4 million unique viewers over the seven-hour event.

Each episode of PlayTime with KittyPlays will feature approximately six hours of original content, including:

Michaela and her guests leading into the live program with a “Just Chatting” pre-show stream on their individual channels starting two hours beforehand;

Topical and personal thought-provoking conversations with esports’ top influencers and celebrity guests energized by live audience member and stream chat participation;

Michaela’s unique perspective on recent events and issues facing today’s gaming communities;

Live, high-level gameplay, including “Squad Fills” and challenges with Michaela’s special guests and lucky audience members chosen at random.

Segments showcasing Michaela teaching pro athletes and celebrity gamers how to improve their craft;

Pre-recorded video shorts highlighting up-and-coming esports stars.

Led by Michaela’s naturally inclusive and positive personality, PlayTime with KittyPlays will also focus on giving a voice to those in the esports space who have gone unrecognized, who hail from diverse backgrounds, and who have overcome adversity to achieve personal bests in gaming and beyond.

Information about live guests, show dates, tickets and viewing platforms will be released in the coming weeks. Fans can follow @KittyPlays, @Allied Esports and @HyperXESALV and visit alliedesports.gg and hyperxesportsarenalasvegas.com for updates and additional news.

Michaela started her career in esports as a Counter-Strike player and began streaming her gameplay on Twitch while attending the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. After seeing success with her broadcasts, Michaela decided to leave school to pursue streaming full time, leading her to the wildly popular game of Fortnite. Since then, Michaela has taken streaming and social media by storm with her focus on positivity, community, and joy in gaming and everyday life. Whether broadcasting games, traveling the world, designing cosplay characters, or simply living a health-conscious life, Michaela’s style and personality play a large part in the creation of her content.

Michaela, who primarily plays Fortnite on her stream, is host to one million-plus followers on Twitch and boasts more than a million monthly viewers between Twitch, YouTube and other social media channels. During E3’s 2018 Celebrity Pro-Am event she paired with actor Chandler Riggs (The Walking Dead) and carried the duo to a third-place finish winning $250,000, with her portion donated to her local charity of choice, Kelowna BC SPCA. Most recently she teamed up with FaZe Clan’s Turner “Tfue” Tenney to compete in Korea’s Fortnite Open. Michaela again dominated the competition and together the pair took home a first-place prize of $1,000,000 to be donated to charity.

What started as a part-time hobby to meet likeminded friends has grown into a career that delivers enthusiasm and positivity to Michaela’s audiences, creating real connections around the world and leaving a lasting positive effect on everyone that watches her. Michaela is the founder of Team Kitty, a Twitch-based networking and mentorship team that enhances Michaela’s vision to create a network of female creators focused on upbeat personalities and high-level viewer interaction. Michaela is currently the Head of New Gaming Initiatives for esports organization Gen.G, with a focus on signing competitive players for its female Fortnite team, as well as sales and building of Gen.G’s newly renamed brand.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today provided an operational and financial update for its subsidiaries Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa Upstream”) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher Midstream”) and announced that Alta Mesa Upstream has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



Operational Update

Alta Mesa Upstream

First quarter 2019 production is estimated to be 37,800 BOE per day (48% oil, 71% liquids). Alta Mesa Upstream entered the year with six rigs actively working and reduced the rig count to zero by the end of January. A new development program was restarted in March by completing 16 drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) and operating two drilling rigs. The Company’s objective with the development program is to improve economic returns through a revised well spacing pattern of four or five wells per section, improved lateral placement and lower well costs. Under the reinvigorated development program, Alta Mesa Upstream has drilled 10 wells completing eight patterns (including the DUCs) and through May 17, 2019 had brought 22 new wells onto production. These wells are all tied into Kingfisher Midstream’s system.

The wells drilled and completed in 2019 have been averaging less than $3.0 million per well compared to $4.5 million per well experienced by the end of the previous drilling program. The Company has also made material progress on reducing lease operating expenses on a unit cost basis and lowering recurring general and administrative costs. More detail will be provided when it reports first quarter 2019 financial results.

Kingfisher Midstream

Kingfisher Midstream’s estimated first quarter volumes are summarized below.

System Gas Volumes 137 MMcf per day

Produced Water Volumes 85,000 Bbl per day

Crude Oil Volumes 6,600 Bbl per day

Proved Reserves

On February 25, 2019, Alta Mesa Upstream provided an initial estimate of 158 MMBoe for December 31, 2018 proved reserves. Based on its April 2019 assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and the uncertainty of funding the related development costs, Alta Mesa Upstream removed a total of 89 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2018, Alta Mesa Upstream had 69 MMBoe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 25 MMBbl of oil, 20 MMBbl of natural gas liquids and 144 Bcf of natural gas. The reserves have a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $813 million. Should Alta Mesa Upstream’s ability to fund the required development costs improve in the future, Alta Mesa Upstream expects to recognize all or a portion of the removed PUD reserves as proved.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update

At May 1, 2019, Alta Mesa Resources had debt with total face value of $1,061 million and $144 million of total liquidity, including $110 million of cash. Alta Mesa Upstream’s total debt was $868 million, comprised of $368 million utilized on its credit facility and $500 million of senior notes. The Company previously disclosed that Alta Mesa Upstream had drawn substantially all remaining capacity under its Credit Facility on April 1, 2019. As of May 1, Alta Mesa Upstream’s liquidity includes $95 million of cash.

Kingfisher Midstream had total borrowings on May 1, 2019 of $193 million within its available credit capacity of $225 million, resulting in liquidity of $47 million comprised of $32 million of available borrowing capacity and $15 million cash on hand. Until the delivery of audited 2018 and unaudited first quarter 2019 financial statements and the related compliance certificates, Kingfisher Midstream is limited to $225 million of borrowing capacity. Once those financials are delivered, the borrowing capacity, subject to continued covenant compliance, will return to $300 million.

The Company continues to make progress in finalizing its Form 10-K as well the first quarter 2019 Forms 10-Q for both Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Upstream but is unable to estimate the date at which these filings will be completed.

NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards

The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified Alta Mesa Resources on May 14, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and because the Company remains delinquent in filing its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Initial Delinquent Filing”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa Resources is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing by June 3, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Initial Delinquent Filing, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

Alta Mesa Resources is working to complete its annual and quarterly reports and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Provides Bank Borrowing Update; Retains Financial Advisor; Receives NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards","HOUSTON, April 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today announced that Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“AMH”) had drawn substantially all of the remaining capacity under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of $370 million after the most recent borrowing base determination on April 1, 2019, which decreased the borrowing base by $30 million. The cash held following the draw, approximately $86 million, is intended for general corporate purposes.



James Hackett, the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In this challenging environment, we believe it is important to increase our liquidity to ensure we have adequate financial flexibility. We will continue to explore our options to strengthen our balance sheet, including options to address our indebtedness.”

Alta Mesa has retained Perella Weinberg Partners and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. as its financial advisor to assist with analyzing and considering financial alternatives.

Alta Mesa today also announced that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified the Company on April 2, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Annual Report”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing within 60 calendar days from the date of notification, or by June 1, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Annual Report's filing due date, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

The Annual Report was not filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time period because the Company needs additional time to complete its financial statements and related disclosures. As previously announced, the Company expects to report material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company has taken additional time to ensure the accuracy of its 2018 financial information, to complete the required discussion and analysis of the business and to finalize the conclusions regarding the assessment of internal control. Although the Company is still completing its testing of internal control, it has not identified material misstatements to its previously filed financial information and believes that no restatements to historical periods will be required. While covenant relief was not attained during the borrowing base redetermination, the Company continues to be in discussions with its lenders under the Credit Facility. If unsuccessful in obtaining relief, the Company may be unable to comply with the terms of the Credit Facility during 2019, which would permit the lenders to cease making amounts available under the Credit Facility, to require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and to exercise other rights under the Credit Facility.

Alta Mesa is working to complete the Annual Report and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Alta Mesa also announced today that NASDAQ notified the Company on April 3, 2019 that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the NASDAQ rules for continued listing. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ’s exchange. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 30, 2019, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 30, 2019, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and September 30, 2019 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed compliance period. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notice.

(Nasdaq:CRAY) today released the findings of its industry report on the State of Enterprise AI Adoption 2019 , which reveals that performance, data locality and security are the top considerations for choosing an AI infrastructure. The survey assessed whether organizations and individuals are prepared to run AI effectively and to take advantage of the capabilities it offers. Findings show that over 70% of companies already have AI applications in use or under development, and as the use of AI grows, IT professionals must consider what infrastructure is needed to maximize the value, scale and performance of their AI workloads.



The State of Enterprise AI Adoption 2019 survey was constructed to help identify the state of enterprise AI adoption, evaluate the perception and value of AI in the enterprise and determine the infrastructure being used to execute AI workflows. The report findings, based on responses of more than 300 IT professionals across a broad range of industries, show that many organizations, 39%, are using supercomputers, HPC systems or dedicated AI hardware to run their AI workloads. For these organizations using on-premises systems, over 60% expect to expand their infrastructure to keep pace with increasing storage and performance demands.

“The research highlights that supercomputing plays an important role in enabling mainstream AI adoption in the enterprise,” said Frederick Kohout, senior vice president and CMO at Cray. “IT professionals see the need to expand their use of on-premises infrastructure, like supercomputers and HPC clusters, to meet the expected growth of business-critical AI applications. Cray’s new Shasta supercomputing systems were designed to handle data-intensive workloads, like AI, and can scale seamlessly from a single cabinet to exascale-class systems so every Enterprise can start small and grow without interruption or penalty.”

Enterprise AI Production Environments Hybridized with Cloud and On-Premises Infrastructure

Nearly 40% of those surveyed said their organizations currently use on-premises systems to execute AI workloads. This includes infrastructure like supercomputers, high performance computing clusters and dedicated AI nodes. And according to these respondents, the top two considerations for utilizing on-premises systems are performance and data locality/security.

While about 40% report using on-premises systems,

65% of respondents with AI applications in use stated they need to expand their on-premises systems to keep pace with increasing performance requirements

35% of respondents are looking to move some of their cloud workloads to on-premises systems

53% of respondents noted that their organization utilizes public cloud services to run AI workloads

The research indicates that many organizations are operating a hybrid data center and rely on the use of multiple systems to run AI applications. Over 70% of those using on-premises systems have also implemented AI in the public cloud, and over half of all public cloud users also utilize on-premises infrastructure for their AI workloads.

Also of note, nearly 60% of IT professionals identified cost-effectiveness as a top consideration when selecting an infrastructure solution for AI. This was followed by the ability to integrate AI systems into existing architecture (50.8%), ease of use (49.2%) and scaling with increasing uses and demands (39.8%). With these being the top infrastructure considerations, it explains why so many organizations utilize both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. By utilizing both, enterprises get the ease of use and cost-effectiveness of the cloud with the performance and scalability of on-premises systems.

“This survey by Cray is consistent with our own AI research studies,” said Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research. “Training for machine learning requires high performance computing, either on-premise or in the cloud, and there is a significant overlap between AI investment and systems for HPC and hyperscale. One way or another, those interested in AI need to access a high-performance infrastructure.”

Other Key Research Findings

High levels of educational activity: 72% of respondents participated in one or more activities to educate themselves on AI in the past year. Over 48% attended AI conferences or received training, over 41% participated in vendor webinars, about 40% took self-study courses and over 35% downloaded and read reports on AI.

Over 48% attended AI conferences or received training, over 41% participated in vendor webinars, about 40% took self-study courses and over 35% downloaded and read reports on AI. AI as a core business function: Over 34% believe AI is already a “critical to business” capability in their organization, or that it will be at some time during 2019. Another 41% expect AI to become critical to their business within the next three years.

Another 41% expect AI to become critical to their business within the next three years. Greater operational value placed on AI: Nearly 70% of survey respondents believe AI could improve operational efficiency while more than half of respondents said AI could help improve the customer experience, create competitive advantage and make data more actionable. Additionally, over 44% believe it could help with controlling costs and growing revenue.

Investment protection: CXOs and business owners benefit from a multi-user and multipurpose platform with support for heterogeneous processor architectures (x86, AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, FPGAs and other accelerators) and the scalability to meet their rapidly growing analytics and AI initiatives.

“Shasta is designed to support extremely heterogeneous workloads not just from science and engineering, but also from the growing contingent of enterprises that acquire supercomputers to outcompete their rivals in the new era of digital transformation and AI,” said Steve Conway, COO and senior vice president of research at Hyperion Research. “Cray Shasta supercomputers aim to move leading enterprises beyond proof-of-concept to production, and to operate on premises or in the cloud. By integrating extremely heterogeneous requirements into the new Shasta system hardware and software, Cray has substantially expanded its addressable market to include enterprise analytics, AI and cloud computing.”

Cray’s new software platform will be available starting Q4 of 2019. For more information, please contact your authorized Cray sales representative or www.cray.com .

Reports 2018 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Feb. 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.

All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

For 2018, Cray reported total revenue of $456 million, which compares with $393 million in 2017. Net loss for 2018 was $72 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $134 million, or $3.33 per diluted share in 2017. Non-GAAP net loss, which adjusts for selected unusual and non-cash items, was $58 million, or $1.42 per diluted share for 2018, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $41 million, or $1.01 per diluted share in 2017.

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $163 million, compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $13 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $98 million, or $2.42 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Please note, 2017 GAAP results were impacted by both the new U.S. tax law and a change to the valuation allowance held against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The combined negative impact on the Company’s 2017 GAAP net loss was $103 million and was excluded for non-GAAP purposes.

For 2018, overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 29%, compared to 33% and 34%, respectively, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2017.

GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $204 million, compared to $196 million in 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $191 million, compared to $177 million in 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, cash, investments, and restricted cash totaled $246 million. Working capital at the end of 2018 was $291 million, compared to $354 million at December 31, 2017.

“Led by strength in our commercial business, we delivered solid growth for the year,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “While our target market continues to show signs of a rebound from its recent lows, 2019 is shaping up to be a transition year as we plan to begin shipping our next generation Shasta platform late this year. Shasta will deliver a balance of performance, flexibility and ease of use unlike anything available today, as well as a true exascale-class architecture capable of scaling well into the future. With continued focus and execution, we are well positioned to expand on our market leadership position and deliver strong long-term growth.”

Outlook

For 2019, while a wide range of results remains possible, Cray expects revenue to grow modestly compared to 2018. Revenue is expected to be about $70 million for the first quarter of 2019. For 2019, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be in the 30% range, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow compared to 2018. Based on this outlook, the Company expects to recognize a substantial GAAP and non-GAAP net loss for 2019.

Cray’s effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2019 are both expected to be in the low single-digit range.

Actual results for any future periods are subject to large fluctuations given the nature of Cray’s business.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

Additionally, we have not quantitatively reconciled the non-GAAP guidance measures disclosed under “Outlook” to their corresponding GAAP measures because we do not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items such as share-based compensation, adjustments to the provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles, costs related to acquisitions, purchase accounting adjustments, and gain on significant asset sales, as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations to the non-GAAP guidance measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our financial results.

(Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced that the first Cray Shasta™ supercomputing system for operational weather forecasting and meteorology will be acquired by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The powerful high-performance computing capabilities of the new system, named HPC11, will enable higher fidelity weather forecasts for U.S. Air Force and Army operations worldwide. The contract is valued at $25 million.



“We’re excited with our Oak Ridge National Laboratory strategic partner’s selection of Cray to provide Air Force Weather’s next high performance computing system,” said Steven Wert, Program Executive Officer Digital, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, and a member of the Senior Executive Service. “The system’s performance will be a significant increase over the existing HPC capability and will provide Air Force Weather operators with the ability to run the next generation of high-resolution, global and regional models, and satisfy existing and emerging warfighter needs for environmental impacts to operations planning.”

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a history of deploying the world’s most powerful supercomputers and through this partnership, will provide supercomputing-as-a-service on the HPC11 Shasta system to the Air Force 557th Weather Wing. The 557th Weather Wing develops and provides comprehensive terrestrial and space weather information to the U.S. Air Force and Army. The new system will feature the revolutionary Cray Slingshot™ interconnect, with features to better support time-critical numerical weather prediction workloads, and will enhance the Air Force’s capabilities to create improved weather forecasts and weather threat assessments so that Air Force missions can be carried out more effectively.

“The HPC11 system will be the first Shasta delivery to the production weather segment, and we’re proud to share this milestone with ORNL and the Air Force,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO at Cray. “The years of innovation behind Shasta and Slingshot and the success of prior generations of Cray systems continue to demonstrate Cray’s ability to support demanding 24/7 operations like weather forecasting. This is a great example of the upcoming Exascale Era bringing a new set of technologies to bear on challenging problems and empowering the Air Force to more effectively execute on its important mission.”

HPC11 will be ORNL’s first Cray Shasta system, as well as the first supercomputing system with 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ processors for use in operational weather forecasting. HPC11 will join the 85% bastion of weather centers that rely on Cray, and will feature eight Shasta cabinets in a dual-hall configuration.

“We are incredibly excited to continue our strategic collaboration with Cray to deliver the first Shasta supercomputer to the U.S. Air Force, helping to improve the fidelity of weather forecasts for U.S. military operations around the globe,” said Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager, Datacenter and Embedded Systems Group, AMD. “The 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors provide exceptional performance in highly complex workloads, a necessary component to power critical weather prediction workloads and deliver more accurate forecasts.”

The system is expected to be delivered in Q4 2019 and accepted in early 2020.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results,"SEATTLE, Aug. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



All figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $69 million, compared to $120 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $43 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $31 million, or $0.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.

Overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2019 was 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 31% and 32%, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $68 million, compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $57 million, compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2019 include $7.6 million in costs related to our pending merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”).

As of June 30, 2019, cash and restricted cash totaled $165 million. Working capital at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was $223 million, compared to $263 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

No Quarterly Conference Call

As previously announced on May 17, 2019, Cray entered into an agreement and plan of merger with HPE to acquire all the issued and outstanding common shares of Cray for $35 per share in cash. Due to the pending merger, Cray will not hold an earnings conference call.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our operational and financial performance during the first quarter of 2019 continued to reflect the challenges we have been experiencing in our industry, but we do have some opportunities for improvement on the horizon. Our Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care rates all increased during the quarter. The increases are a combination of cost reimbursement along with acuity factors for our centers. We have enrolled the majority of our Texas centers in the state’s Quality Incentive Payment Program, which we expect to be effective for these centers in September of this year. This program rewards operators who maintain high quality measures with enhanced Medicaid reimbursements. We are implementing cost reductions to align our overhead cost structure with the current environment. CMS has proposed a net 2.5% market basket increase for this coming October. Year over year, our skilled mix patients decreased from 16.1% in the first quarter of 2018 to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2019. It should be noted though that this quarter was the highest skilled mix we have seen since the first quarter of 2018.""

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""I am extremely grateful for and proud of our team members as they continue to be devoted to our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

First Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.9 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 10.1 % 11.6 % Medicaid census 68.7 % 67.9 % Managed Care census 4.8 % 4.5 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 18.6 % 21.1 % Medicaid revenues 47.3 % 45.2 % Managed Care revenues 10.6 % 10.1 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 457.10 $ 455.72 Medicaid $ 181.13 $ 176.78 Managed Care $ 394.55 $ 391.96

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $134.4 million and $141.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $6.9 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 134,353 $ 136,571 $ (2,218 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,714 $ (4,714 ) Total revenue $ 134,353 $ 141,285 $ (6,932 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.7 million of the $6.9 million patient revenues decrease. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $2.2 million. Our average Medicaid and Medicare rates per patient day for the first quarter of 2019 increased compared to the first quarter of 2018, resulting in increases in revenue of $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, or 2.5% and 0.3%, respectively. Our Hospice average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 increased 15.8%, resulting in $1.0 million in additional revenue. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 13.4%, 0.1% and 10.1%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $4.1 million, $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Our ancillary revenue for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.3 million.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the first quarter of 2019 to $108.1 million as compared to $112.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.5% for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.5% for the first quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Change Same-store operating expense $ 108,113 $ 109,101 $ (988 ) 2018 disposition operating expenses

— 3,177 (3,177 ) Total expense $ 108,113 $ 112,278 $ (4,165 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $3.2 million of the $4.2 million operating expense decrease. Our same-store operating expenses decreased by $1.0 million, which is mostly attributable to favorable variances in nursing and ancillary costs and salaries and related taxes of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable variances in dietary costs and maintenance and utilities expense of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $65.1 million during the first quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the first quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the $1.7 million impact of non-cash straight-line expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.4 million and $2.8 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.9 million and $1.1 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the accrual for professional liability.

General and administrative expense was $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2019 from 5.8% in the first quarter of 2018. The change in general and administrative expense is attributable to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in depreciation expense relates to the dispositions of Fulton, Clinton and Glasgow in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Interest expense was $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million first quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.2 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $4.3 million before income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. The benefit for income taxes was $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2019, and the benefit for income taxes was $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. Both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $0.52 for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations of $0.01 in the first quarter of 2018.

Receivables

Our net receivables balance decreased $2.4 million to $63.9 million as of March 31, 2019, from $66.3 million as of December 31, 2018.

We have included certain financial measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAR as EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as EBITDAR adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense and litigation contingency expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on sale of assets, severance expense, litigation contingency expense, tax impact related to those adjustments, and discontinued operations, net of tax. Funds Provided by Operations is defined as net income from operating activities adjusted for the cash effect of professional liability and other non-cash charges. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred tax benefit and other non-cash charges.

Our measurements of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses, separation costs and other items. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred taxes and other non-cash items. Our presentation of EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

(NASDAQ: DVCR), a premier provider of long-term care services, today announced its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019.



Second Quarter 2019 Highlights

In the second quarter, the Company and the Department of Justice (""DOJ"") reached an agreement in principle to settle its ongoing investigation. As a result of this agreement, the Company increased its litigation contingency accrual by $3.1 million to a total of $9.5 million.





The Company recognized an additional $20.0 million of non-cash income tax expense related to the increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during the quarter.





Net loss from continuing operations was $(24.6) million, or $(3.80) per share, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $(0.3) million, or $(0.05) per share, in the second quarter of 2018.





Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $0.6 million compared to $4.6 million for the year ago quarter.





Our adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $16.4 million.

See below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.

CEO Remarks

Commenting on the quarter, Jay McKnight, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Our primary update for the quarter is the announcement that we have reached an agreement in principle to settle the ongoing DOJ investigation into the Company’s therapy practices dating back to 2010. This investigation period predates our leadership team and has been a significant distraction for quite some time. We still have some work ahead of us to finalize the agreement and related Corporate Integrity Agreement, but reaching this agreement in principle represents substantial progress in resolving this matter. We ask that our investors please refer to our updated SEC filings for further information.""

Mr. McKnight continued, “You will note that we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this quarter via a non-cash tax expense item of $20 million. The accounting guidance related to matters like this is very complicated, but because of our government settlement and other financial factors we were required to complete the process of evaluating these assets this quarter. We believe we have significant positive financial evidence that we will continue to evaluate each quarter going forward.”

Mr. McKnight concluded, ""We made significant progress on our exit from Kentucky this quarter, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. Our industry continues to experience challenges and strong headwinds; however, I am proud and amazed by the level of commitment that our team members continue to exude in their efforts to deliver on our mission, which is improving every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations.""

Second Quarter 2019 Results

The following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Skilled nursing occupancy 78.5 % 79.8 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 9.7 % 10.6 % Medicaid census 69.2 % 68.9 % Managed Care census 4.6 % 4.2 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 17.9 % 19.7 % Medicaid revenues 47.5 % 46.5 % Managed Care revenues 10.5 % 9.4 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 458.33 $ 455.29 Medicaid $ 181.42 $ 177.58 Managed Care $ 393.81 $ 397.49

Patient Revenues

Patient revenues were $135.4 million and $141.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $5.7 million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Change Same-store revenue $ 135,370 $ 136,544 $ (1,174 ) 2018 disposition revenue — 4,538 (4,538 ) Total revenue $ 135,370 $ 141,082 $ (5,712 )

The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 contributed $4.5 million of the $5.7 million decrease in patient revenues. Our same-store patient revenues decreased by $1.2 million. Our average Medicaid rate per patient day for the second quarter of 2019 increased compared to the second quarter of 2018, resulting in an increase in revenue of $1.6 million, or 2.1%. Our Hospice and Managed Care average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 increased 14.2% and 7.6%, respectively, resulting in $1.0 million and $0.8 million in additional revenue, respectively. Conversely, our Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the second quarter of 2019 decreased 9.6%, 0.6% and 13.3%, respectively, resulting in revenue losses of $2.7 million, $0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Operating Expense

Operating expense decreased in the second quarter of 2019 to $108.6 million from $111.4 million in the second quarter of 2018, a decrease of $2.8 million. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 80.3% for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to 79.0% for the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to changes in our portfolio (in thousands):

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019

2018

Change

Same-store operating expense $ 108,447 $ 107,850 $ 597 2018 disposition operating expenses

194 3,590 (3,396 ) Total expense $ 108,641 $ 111,440 $ (2,799 )





The three Kentucky centers we sold in December 2018 reduced operating expenses by $3.4 million. Our same-store operating expenses increased by $0.6 million, which is mostly attributable to increases in health insurance costs of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by decreases in nursing and ancillary expenses and maintenance and utility costs of $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.

One of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which decreased from $67.8 million in the second quarter of 2018, to $65.2 million during the second quarter of 2019.

Lease expense in the second quarter of 2019 increased to $15.8 million as compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in lease expense was due to rent increases resulting from the new master lease agreement with Omega Healthcare Investors and the impact of non-cash straight-line rent expense.

Professional liability expense was $3.0 million and $3.2 million in the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.7 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018. Professional liability expense fluctuates based on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and cash expenditures are incurred to defend and settle existing claims.

In June, 2019, the Company and the U.S. Department of Justice reached an agreement in principle on the financial terms of a settlement regarding a civil investigative demand. In anticipation of the execution of final agreements and payment of a settlement amount of $9.5 million, we recorded an additional loss contingency expense of $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 to increase our previously estimated and recorded liability related to this investigation.

General and administrative expense was $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $9.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019 from 6.6% in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease in general and administrative expense is mainly attributable to $1.2 million of executive severance expense in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining change is due to a decrease in salaries and related taxes of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in depreciation expense relates to the acceleration of depreciation for the leasehold improvements in Kentucky, which are expected to be abandoned in the third quarter of 2019.

Interest expense was $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease of $0.1 million is due to a decrease in the outstanding borrowings on our loan facilities.

The Company recorded an income tax provision of $17.4 million during the second quarter of 2019 and an income tax benefit of $0.4 million during the second quarter of 2018. The increase in income tax expense is attributable to a non-cash charge for a valuation allowance recognized against our deferred tax assets in the amount of $20.0 million in the second quarter of 2019.

As a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $7.2 million before income taxes for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2018. Both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $3.80 for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations of $0.05 in the second quarter of 2018.

Receivables

Our net receivables balance increased $1.7 million to $68.0 million as of June 30, 2019, from $66.3 million as of December 31, 2018.

(c) Represents non-recurring debt retirement costs related to the amendment of our debt agreements in December 2018.

(d) Represents non-recurring gain on sale of assets related to the sale of three Kentucky centers in December 2018. (e) Represents non-recurring gain on the sale of an unconsolidated affiliate in November 2016. (f) Represents non-recurring costs associated with disposition-related transactions. (g) Represents tax provision for the cumulative adjustments for each period.

We have included certain financial performance and valuation measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss), which are “non-GAAP financial measures” using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, debt retirement costs, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for rent expense. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, debt retirement costs, gain on sale of assets, litigation contingency expense, severance expense, and gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate and income (loss) from discontinued operations.

Our measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR, and Adjusted Net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important financial performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses and separation costs. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net income (loss) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

We have included Adjusted EBITDAR in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of the Company’s valuation. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAR is an important financial valuation measure that is commonly used by our management, research analysts, investors, lenders and financial institutions, to compare the enterprise value of different companies in the healthcare industry, without regard to differences in capital structures and leasing arrangements. Adjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure and is not displayed as a performance measure as it excludes rent expense, which is a normal and recurring operating expense. As such, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR, should not be construed as a financial performance measure.

The respective special stockholder meetings will be held today, July 9, 2019, to consider approval of the proposed merger and spin-off transaction. Subject to approval by holders of record of the companies at the respective special stockholder meetings, MYnd will issue a number of shares of common stock to the current Emmaus shareholders, which will result in MYnd shareholders retaining 5.9% of the fully diluted shares of the 'New Emmaus' post-closing and a pro rata distribution of one share of Telemynd’s common stock for each share of MYnd common stock held at the end of trading on July 16, 2019. The companies have set a new Spin-Off Record Date of July 15, 2019 in order to comply with certain NASDAQ and DTC requirements. Those individuals who hold shares at the close of trading on the 16th of July will receive the Telemynd dividend. MYnd shares will trade ex-dividend on July 17, which means that persons who purchase MYnd shares on July 17 will not receive shares of Telemynd.

It is expected that on July 16 and July 17, the necessary steps will occur to spin off Telemynd with the current MYnd assets, effectuate the merger and any adjustments needed to meet NASDAQ listing standards and commence trading on July 18, 2019 under the new symbol “EMMA.”

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “We are very grateful for this opportunity to merge with MYnd Analytics.

Endari addresses a $3 billion worldwide market

MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., Jan. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND), a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, today announced that it has entered into a definitive stock-for-stock merger agreement with Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Emmaus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MYnd Analytics in exchange for MYnd Analytics’ issuance of common stock to Emmaus shareholders and other equity holders. The exchange ratio will result in Emmaus securityholders owning approximately 94% of the MYnd Analytics’ common stock on a fully diluted basis after the merger. It is anticipated that the surviving company will change its name to Emmaus and receive a new ticker symbol to reflect the name change. The company expects to meet all applicable requirements for initial listing upon completion of the merger and, therefore, expects to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval from the shareholders of each company and Nasdaq approval. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as a financial advisor to Emmaus in connection with this transaction.

In connection with the transaction, MYnd Analytics intends to transfer all of its assets (including cash and its equity interest in Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services, LLC) and liabilities into its wholly-owned subsidiary, MYnd Analytics California, and to distribute the shares of MYnd Analytics California to MYnd Analytics’ shareholders as of a record date prior to the merger, which will be set prior to the merger effective time. MYnd Analytics expects that the MYnd Analytics California subsidiary, following the spinoff, will commence trading as an independent company at a date to be announced. Under the leadership of its new CEO, Patrick Herguth, the MYnd Analytics California spin off intends to continue operating, integrating and growing its technology-enabled telepsychiatry and teletherapy businesses in order to provide enhanced access to behavioral health services, improve patient outcomes and help lower the costs associated with behavioral health issues. MYnd-Arcadian customers include major health plans, health systems, and community-based organizations. The parties do not expect there to be any disruption to the existing business or customers.

Emmaus is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, including those in the rare and orphan disease categories. Its lead prescription product, Endari, demonstrated positive clinical results in a completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell disease and received FDA approval in July 2017. Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. The results of the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on July 19th, 2018.

Emmaus launched Endari in the United States in early 2018 and has experienced strong market uptake. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Additionally, Emmaus has distribution agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors, making Endari available to selected pharmacies nationwide.

Outside the United States, the treatment is currently available through an Early Access Program for sickle cell disease patients that have exhausted other treatment options. Emmaus is currently in the process of seeking marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency for its medication. Emmaus has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA which provides protection from competition in the United States and Orphan Medicinal designation from the European Commission for protection in the European Union.

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “The merger with MYnd Analytics, and concurrent Nasdaq listing, will be a major milestone for the company, and builds on our recent progress, including the FDA approval of Endari, the publication of our Phase 3 results in The New England Journal of Medicine , Medicaid coverage, the addition of major pharmaceutical distributors, and a presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 Annual Meeting. Just as important as these accomplishments was the launch and market acceptance of Endari – the first medication (FDA approved) for sickle cell disease in almost 20 years. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other clinical indications such as diverticulosis. Through this merger, we believe we can maximize value for shareholders and we are grateful to MYnd for this opportunity.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are excited to announce this definitive merger agreement with Emmaus, whereby the MYnd shareholders will own equity in Emmaus, and upon our expected spin-off, will continue to own 100% of the predictive analytics and telemedicine business, which we expect to begin operations as a new standalone public company. We are quite encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to further integrating and accelerating the growth of our offerings under Patrick Herguth’s leadership. We plan to provide further details on the new operational direction, branding, and growth strategy in the coming weeks and months.”

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle Cell Disease is an orphan disease with significant unmet medical needs, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide.

(NASDAQ: FRED) reported financial results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2019. Except as otherwise noted, the comparable results from the prior year contained herein have been adjusted for discontinued operations related to the sale of Fred’s specialty pharmacy business to an affiliate of CVS Health Corporation and certain assets of Fred’s retail pharmacy business to Walgreen Co. The amounts and percentages presented below, for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial conditions from Fred’s continuing operations.

Joe Anto, Fred’s CEO, stated, “We are disappointed with our operating results for the quarter, but are moving aggressively to right size our store footprint, reduce our cost structure, paydown our ABL and stabilize our operating model. As of June 17th, our ABL balance stood at $51.1 million versus $81.3 million at the end of Q1. We are continuing to work constructively with our banks and per our forbearance agreement, we have specific milestones related to refinancing our current facility, which we are actively working towards. We look forward to sharing updates on this process as soon as possible.”

First Quarter Fiscal 2019 vs. First Quarter Fiscal 2018

Net sales were down 5.2% to $319.0 million in Q1 2019 versus $336.4 million in Q1 2018.





Comparable store sales decreased 8.5% in Q1 2019 compared to the same period of 2018.





Gross profit decreased 16.2% to $74.6 million in Q1 2019 versus $89.1 million in Q1 2018.





Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 309 basis points to 23.4% in Q1 2019 versus 26.5% in Q1 2018.





Total selling, general, and administrative expenses were $101.4 million in Q1 2019, or 31.8% of sales, compared to $109.2 million in Q1 2018, or 32.5% of sales.





Selling, general, and administrative expenses, adjusted for non-recurring items, were $93.4 million in Q1 2019, or 29.3% of sales, compared to $106.7 million in Q1 2018, or 31.7% of sales.





Impairment expense of $0.3 million was recorded during Q1 2019 on certain assets related to the decline in the results of operations compared to no impairment expense recorded in Q1 2018.





Net loss from continuing operations was $29.5 million, or $(0.84) per share, in Q1 2019, compared to a loss of $22.0 million, or $(0.60) per share, in Q1 2018.





Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(11.7) million in Q1 2019 compared to $(7.4) million in Q1 2018.





First Quarter 2019 Results



Fred’s net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 5.2% to $319.0 million from $336.4 million in the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 8.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. The sales decline was primarily the result of weak sales of consumables caused by the reduction in store traffic due to out-of-stock issues in certain product categories.

Fred’s gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 16.2% to $74.6 million from $89.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 309 basis points to 23.4% from 26.5% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage was primarily caused by discounting initiatives implemented during the quarter throughout the store chain.



Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter decreased $7.9 million to $101.4 million compared to last year’s first quarter of $109.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 68 basis points to 31.8% of sales from 32.5% of sales in the first quarter last year. The decrease is generally attributable to continued reductions in headcount and other general cost-containment initiatives implemented throughout the company.



Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $93.4 million, or 29.3% of sales, in Q1 of 2019 compared to $106.7 million, or 31.7% of sales, in Q1 of 2018.



Due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles in several underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. Comparatively, in the first quarter of 2018, no impairment expense was incurred.



For the first quarter of 2019, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $29.5 million, or $(0.84) per share, compared to a net loss of $22.0 million, or $(0.60) per share, during the same period in 2018. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to a decline in the sales volume during the period ended May 4, 2019 compared to the prior year.



Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(11.7) million compared to $(7.4) million in the first quarter of 2018.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 resulted in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which constitutes an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced store closures, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s has entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders pursuant to which Fred’s stipulated to the occurrence of certain events of default and such lenders agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to not take any action to accelerate our indebtedness or exercise other remedies until July 22, 2019. There can be no assurance that such lenders will not do so on or after such date or if the conditions in the forbearance agreement are not met in the future. For additional information regarding this agreement and Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern, please see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2019 and Fred’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 4, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 18, 2019.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation. amortization and impairment expense (i.e. Total selling, general and administrative expenses) and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

(NASDAQ: FRED) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 2, 2019. Except as otherwise noted, the results contained herein have been adjusted for discontinued operations related to the sale of Fred’s specialty pharmacy business to an affiliate of CVS Health Corporation and certain assets of Fred’s retail pharmacy business to Walgreen Co. The amounts and percentages presented below, for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial conditions from Fred’s continuing operations.



Joe Anto, Fred’s CEO, stated “This is clearly a challenging time for the Company and we are disappointed with our operating results for the quarter and fiscal year. We are working to optimize our store footprint, cost structure and operating model, while also addressing concerns regarding our liquidity profile. As of April 30, 2019, our ABL balance stood at $78.3 million versus $58.6 million at the end of Q4. Additionally, we are working on various sale processes for non-core assets, including certain real estate and our remaining pharmacy script portfolio.”

Selling, general, and administrative expenses, adjusted for non-recurring items, were $102.6 million in Q4 2018, or 33.4% of sales, compared to $108.4 million in Q4 2017, or 29.2% of sales.

Impairment expense of $31.7 million was recorded during Q4 2018 of certain assets related to the decline in the results of operations compared to the $2.5 million recorded in Q4 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(17.7) million in Q4 2018 compared to $31.4 million in Q4 2017.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses, adjusted for non-recurring items, were $409.3 million, or 32.2% of sales, in fiscal 2018 compared to $439.2 million, or 31.5% of sales, in fiscal 2017.

Impairment expense of $33.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2018 compared to $2.5 million recorded in fiscal 2017.

Net loss from continuing operations was $137.2 million, or $(3.76) per share, in fiscal 2018, compared to a loss of $144.5 million, or $(3.87) per share, in fiscal 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(48.1) million in fiscal 2018 compared to $20.3 million in fiscal 2017.

Fourth Quarter 2018 Results

Fred’s net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 17.2% to $307.1 million from $370.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 9.7% compared to a 4.8% decrease in the fourth quarter of last year.

Fred’s gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 22.1% to $71.7 million from $92.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin percentage for the quarter decreased 147 basis points to 23.4% from 24.8% in the same quarter last year.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $23.6 million to $136.7 million compared to last year’s fourth quarter of $113.2 million. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses, increased 1,400 basis points to 44.5% of sales from 30.5% of sales in the fourth quarter last year.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $102.6 million, or 33.4% of sales, in Q4 of 2018 compared to $108.4 million, or 29.2% of sales, in Q4 of 2017.

Due primarily to the reduction in the estimated fair value of fixed assets and intangibles related to underperforming stores, Fred’s recorded an impairment expense of $31.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Comparatively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Fred’s recorded impairment expense of $2.5 million.

For the fourth quarter of 2018, Fred’s recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $67.2 million, or $(1.86) per share, compared to a net loss of $25.4 million, or $(0.68) per share, during the same period in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(17.7) million compared to $31.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Fiscal Year End 2018 Results

Net sales for 2018 decreased to $1.272 billion from $1.396 billion in 2017 for a year-over-year decrease of $124.1 million or 8.9%. Comparable store sales for 2018 decreased 1.6% from the same period last year. Front store (non-pharmacy) sales decreased 11.8% over 2017 front store sales. The decrease year over year was primarily due to the clearance of merchandise that management identified as under-productive combined with our out of stock position of many key front store items.

Fred’s gross profit for the year decreased to $323.0 million in 2018 from $363.8 million in 2017, a year-over-year decrease of $40.8 million, or 11.2%. Gross margin rate, measured as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.4% in 2018 from 26.1% in 2017, an approximately 70-basis point decline. Factors contributing to the decline in gross margin were related to continued pressures Fred’s experienced in its retail pharmacy business, specifically related to prescription rebates in 2017 that did not recur in 2018 and an increase in DIR fees paid to PBMs. In the front store, gross margin was impacted by promotional markdowns as well as a shift in sales mix from general merchandise to food and consumables.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $452.5 million, or 35.6% of sales, in 2018 from $500.8 million, or 35.9% of sales, in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of bank fees, financing termination fees and professional fees incurred in 2017 related to the attempted Rite Aid acquisition and the closing of 39 underperforming stores in the prior year that were not repeated in 2018. Additionally, costs decreased as a result of the cost containment measures experienced during fiscal 2018.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-recurring items, decreased to $409.3 million, or 32.2% of sales, for the fiscal year 2018 compared to $439.2 million, or 31.5% of sales, for the same period in 2017.

Impairment expense of $33.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2018 related to long lived assets, including intangibles related to the decline in the results of operations compared to the $2.5 million recorded in fiscal 2017.

Net loss from continuing operations decreased $7.3 million to $137.2 million, or $(3.76) per share, in 2018 from a loss of $144.5 million, or $(3.87) per share, in 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(48.1) million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $20.3 million in 2017.

Going Concern; Other Matters

As further detailed in Fred’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2019, the report of Fred’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred’s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred’s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 will result in a breach of a covenant under Fred’s Revolving Credit Agreement, which will constitute an event of default under such agreement. In addition, Fred’s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement have indicated to Fred’s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with Fred’s previously-announced closure of 159 stores, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement. An event of default, which is not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of Fred’s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, among other remedies. Fred’s is currently seeking an agreement with its lenders pursuant to which such lenders would forbear for a period of time from seeking remedies on account of, or waive, the foregoing events or potential events of default, but there is no assurance that Fred’s will receive such forbearance or waivers.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because the measures present an alternative and more relevant method for measuring the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, and, when viewed together with the Company’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than the GAAP results alone.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before interest and other income and expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include discontinued operations, impairment, closed stores, professional fees, stock compensation, LIFO adjustments, and other. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization and excludes certain non-recurring items, such as closed stores, non-recurring professional fees, severance, and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s does not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and any proceeds from asset dispositions, both of which are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparisons of liquidity with other companies within the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

That consistency and the on- and off-mountain experience we provide are drivers of our season pass sales growth. In addition, our recent investments in customer outreach initiatives, including data and analytics attribution, social media, and strategic marketing and branding, are helping to better connect Peak Resorts with our customers as we showcase the value of our season pass offerings. We look forward to the upcoming season as we put further investments to work to create more compelling experiences across our mountains.”

The 2018/2019 season was one of the Company’s longest ski seasons in its history, including 147 days of skiing and riding at Mount Snow, 140 days at Hunter Mountain and an impressive 150 days at Wildcat. As our attention now turns to summer, Peak Resorts has a number of capital improvement projects planned for its growing resort portfolio. Work has already started on approximately $3.5 million in upgrades to the snowmaking infrastructure at Liberty Mountain, Whitetail and Roundtop Mountain in Pennsylvania. These investments across all three resorts will increase pump power and water capacity and add new state-of-the-art guns to markedly improve energy efficiency and overall snowmaking.

(NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year as summarized below:

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues $ 85,458 $ 56,032 $ 184,426 $ 131,662 Resort operating costs $ 42,699 $ 31,951 $ 119,737 $ 96,593 Income from operations $ 30,402 $ 17,413 $ 28,916 $ 10,219 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders for basic EPS $ 17,283 $ 9,280 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Net income (loss) available to common shareholders adjusted for diluted EPS $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 6,596 $ (248 ) Income (Loss) per share (basic) $ 1.13 $ 0.66 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Income (Loss) per share (diluted) $ 0.83 $ 0.56 $ 0.45 $ (0.02 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding 15,166 13,982 14,504 13,982 Vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) 155 102 133 78 Dilutive effect of conversion of preferred stock 6,359 3,180 - - Dilutive effect of unvested RSUs 36 44 39 - Reported EBITDA* $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585 *See page 3 for Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Fiscal 2019 was a record year for Peak Resorts as we completed several transformational initiatives that drove robust year over year growth. We generated record revenue and Reported EBITDA of $184.4 million and $49.8 million, respectively, thanks to our successful Snow Time acquisition and the fantastic execution of our resort operating teams who provided our guests with great conditions throughout a season of variable weather. We also delivered double-digit growth across our season pass offerings, saw continued strength across key revenue streams including food and beverage, ski school and retail, and benefited from our geographic and market diversification and ongoing customer outreach initiatives.



“Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%. Many of our resorts benefited from our continued strategic investments, including at Mount Snow where we saw the benefit of the new Carinthia Base Lodge and at Hunter where we debuted a significant terrain expansion, contributing to increased visitation of 6% and 12%, respectively, at these resorts. In addition, consistent investments in snowmaking capacity and efficiency allowed us to ensure that our growing visitor base was able to access more terrain and more often throughout the season, even when challenged by variable weather.

“As expected, the Snow Time portfolio delivered strong results in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and throughout the season despite nearly 20 fewer operating days during the season. The initial implementation of our operating strategies at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop allowed us to more than offset the shorter season at each of the three resorts as we drove a significant improvement in profitability across the portfolio. Given that we completed the acquisition of Snow Time right before the start of the 2018-19 season, we expect to see added benefits going forward as we further refine operations at these resorts.

“As announced in early May, 2019-20 season pass sales were very strong through the discounted sales window and we expect this momentum to continue. Sales of season passes, including our Peak Pass, which allows for unlimited access to 14 of our resorts across the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, were up 20.8% on a unit basis and 19.8% on a dollar basis over the prior year, inclusive of Snow Time pass sales in both periods. Pass sales momentum has continued and we are well positioned heading into what we believe will be yet another great winter season in 2019-20. We see clear signs that our season pass offerings have become the leading choice for skiers and riders who make the East Coast their home.

“With a strong finish to the 2018-19 season and strong season pass sales for the upcoming 2019-20 season, Peak Resorts is positioned for further growth in fiscal 2020. We are already working on roughly $3.5 million in snowmaking upgrades at Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, and expect to see a full year of benefit from our recently awarded liquor license at Whitetail and our continued efforts to enhance our food and beverage operations. We also expect to see further benefits from investments in our resorts, including at Mount Snow, Hunter and more recently at Hidden Valley. Looking at the summer and fall seasons, we expect to benefit from a packed event schedule that will leverage our amazing resorts to generate revenue during our seasonally slow periods, including food and beer festivals, concerts, outdoor entertainment events and on-mountain activities such as zip lining and mountain biking.”

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 fourth quarter revenue increased 52.5% year over year to $85.5 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time for the full quarter as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 11.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded an 81.1% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 34.4% rise in food and beverage revenue and 57.8% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter rose 33.6% year over year to $42.7 million due to the addition of Snow Time in the quarter as the Company managed its labor and other expenses in-line with its expectations. Power and utilities expenses were up 21.1% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity. Other operating expenses increased during the quarter due to the inclusion of the Snow Time resorts and organic spending on IT projects, repairs and maintenance and insurance costs. General and administrative expenses were up 184.3% to $4.7 million driven primarily by increased compensation expense as a result of the Company’s strong fiscal 2019 fourth quarter performance and additional professional service fees associated with the Snow Time acquisition.

Reported EBITDA for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 was $36.9 million, compared to $21.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The 71.5% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of operations from Snow Time as well as organic growth of roughly 14.3% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of April 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $30.2 million and total outstanding debt of $229.8 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and short and long-term debt of $217.4 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts exited fiscal 2019 positioned for further growth as we continue to integrate the Snow Time resorts and benefit from improved operations and greater scale across our resort portfolio. Our operating teams remain focused on managing costs and driving increased efficiency and enhanced profitability across each area of our business even as we maintain our commitment of providing the highest level of guest service possible.

“As our attention turns to fiscal 2020 and beyond, we believe we have the needed financial flexibility to continue to improve existing operations while also exploring opportunities to drive cash flow and improve our capital structure. With our focus on the continued improvement across the entirety of our business, we are excited by what the future holds and for the opportunities ahead.”

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

April 30, Year ended

April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income $ 18,083 $ 9,680 $ 8,916 $ 1,352 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,987 4,273 4,704 (3,962 ) Interest expense, net 4,505 3,586 15,788 13,322 Depreciation and amortization 6,077 3,553 19,618 13,231 Acquisition related costs 419 - 1,045 - Restructuring and impairment charges - 549 190 2,135 Other income (90 ) (43 ) (159 ) (160 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (83 ) (83 ) (333 ) (333 ) Reported EBITDA $ 36,898 $ 21,515 $ 49,769 $ 25,585

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

*See page 3 for Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results and our good start to the 2018-19 ski season, given variable weather patterns and at times challenging conditions across the Northeast and Midwest. By combining our healthy organic growth with the addition of the three Snow Time resorts to our operating base beginning in late November, as well as our ongoing efforts to diligently manage expenses, Peak Resorts was able to overcome these challenges and generate revenue, net income and Reported EBITDA growth of 42%, 48% and 46% in the fiscal 2019 third quarter, respectively.

“Organic revenue and Reported EBITDA both grew roughly 10% in the 2019 fiscal third quarter, largely driven by the two major projects that debuted for the 2018-19 season. Mount Snow benefited from the new Carinthia Base Lodge, which dramatically expanded on-mountain services at the resort and provided a very popular parking, mountain access and après ski destination for our guests. Snowmaking investments at Mount Snow also allowed us to offer guests the predictable and stable conditions they have come to expect, despite variable weather throughout the quarter. Hunter Mountain also saw healthy visitation growth driven by the Hunter North terrain expansion, which has improved guest flows across the mountain and increased uphill capacity and parking access.

“The benefits of the Snow Time acquisition, which closed just before the start of the 2018-19 ski season in late November, are already evident as our three newest resorts delivered good financial performance despite a slightly later start to their seasons as a result of warm early winter temperatures. Through the addition of Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop, we have diversified our business, allowing us to deliver improved financial performance across all conditions thanks to our broad geographic base, attractive amenities and our increasingly popular Peak Pass.

“Peak Pass sales for the 2019-20 season began last week as we continue to deliver on our promise to provide enhanced value and unlimited mountain access, including additional resorts for next season and flat pricing through the April 30 early season window. Adding the three Snow Time resorts to the pass for the first time further expands skiing and riding options for our guests which, combined with its attractive price point, should allow the Peak Pass to take additional market share as more Northeast and Midwest guests see the value of an unlimited, multi-mountain offering. We believe the Peak Pass is unmatched in the industry and we look forward to welcoming new and returning guests this summer and into the 2019-20 season and beyond.

“Peak Resorts has never been better positioned to grow our business and enhance value for our shareholders. Peak Pass sales grew at double-digit rates for the 2018-19 ski season as the pass benefits from increased visibility and growing acceptance across a broader geographic area, including some of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our on-mountain additions such as the Carinthia Base Lodge and the Hunter North terrain have greatly improved the guest experience. Ongoing efforts to enhance snowmaking across our mountain portfolio allow us to deliver great skiing and riding conditions even when Mother Nature does not cooperate. And the addition of Snow Time has favorably scaled up our business. The future is bright for Peak Resorts and we look forward to finishing out the 2018-19 ski season.”

Fiscal Third Quarter Results Review

Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenue increased 41.7% year over year to $84.0 million as the Company benefited from the addition of Snow Time beginning on November 26, 2018 as well as organic revenue growth of roughly 9.7% over the prior year period. For the quarter, the Company recorded a 54.4% increase in ski instruction revenue, a 45.5% rise in food and beverage revenue and 44.1% growth in lift ticket and tubing revenues.

Resort operating expenses in the fiscal 2019 third quarter rose 36.3% year over year to $49.0 million, with the 28.6% increase in labor expenses driven by the addition of Snow Time’s operations and offset in part by lower labor expenses at the Company’s same-store resorts as a result of the Attitash Hotel closure and efforts to manage staffing levels to combat minimum wage increases. Power and utilities expenses were up 51.9% year over year on the addition of Snow Time as well as increased snowmaking activity at Mount Snow and Hunter, in particular, to refresh terrain following warmer temperature cycles. Other operating expenses in the quarter included higher insurance costs, new groomer leases and increased sales commissions. General and administrative expenses were up 145.5% to $3.3 million driven primarily by the addition of Snow Time, one-time acquisition-related expenses and increased performance-driven compensation expenses.

Reported EBITDA for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 was $30.7 million, compared to $21.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The 46.0% year over year increase in Reported EBITDA included the addition of Snow Time beginning in November 2018 as well as organic growth of roughly 9.6% over the prior year period.

Balance Sheet Update

As of January 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $27.2 million and total outstanding debt of $230.6 million, including $12.4 million drawn against its revolving line of credit and long-term debt of $218.2 million.

Christopher J. Bub, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Peak Resorts remains in a very healthy financial position as the tireless efforts of our mountain operations teams allowed the Company to drive efficiencies across the business and enhance our profitability in the 2019 fiscal third quarter and going forward. Furthermore, we have added Snow Time’s three mountain operations to our business and are already benefitting from the enhanced scale even as we plan for further efforts to drive additional synergies in the coming quarter. In addition, with the major capital investments at Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain now behind us, our capital expenditure needs will decline going forward, allowing Peak Resorts to further improve its balance sheet and cash flow.

“As we wrap up the 2018-19 ski season, we are confident that Peak Resorts’ financial flexibility will allow us to continue our efforts to invest in and improve existing operations while exploring further opportunities to scale up the business through acquisition.

Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to the GAAP related measure of net loss:

(dollars in thousands) Three months ended

January 31, Nine months ended

January 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income (loss) $ 13,631 $ 9,181 $ (9,167 ) $ (8,328 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 5,574 3,433 (3,283 ) (8,235 ) Interest expense, net 4,458 3,529 11,283 9,736 Depreciation and amortization 6,809 3,379 13,541 9,678 Restructuring and impairment charges - 1,586 190 1,586 Acquisition related costs 295 - 626 - Other income (22 ) (28 ) (69 ) (117 ) Gain on sale/leaseback (84 ) (84 ) (250 ) (250 ) Reported EBITDA* $ 30,661 $ 20,996 $ 12,871 $ 4,070

The Company has specifically chosen to include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of its results of operations because it considers this measurement to be a significant indication of its financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to the Company’s ski resorts operations, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate financial performance and available capital resources using net income alone. In addition, the use of this non-U.S. GAAP measure provides an indication of the Company’s ability to service debt, and management considers it an appropriate measure to use because of the Company’s highly leveraged position. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, they will have a clearer understanding of the Company’s financial performance and cash flows because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of its capital structure and asset base from operating results; and (iii) is used by the Board of Directors, management and lenders for various purposes, including as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and as a basis for planning.

The items excluded from net income to arrive at Reported EBITDA are significant components for understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Snow Time Season Pass Upgrade Results Demonstrate the Strong Appeal of the Unlimited Peak Pass

WILDWOOD, Mo., Nov. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peak Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ:SKIS) (“Peak” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded U.S. ski resorts, announced today that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of Snow Time, Inc. (“Snow Time”). Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Peak Resorts paid approximately $70 million in cash consideration to Snow Time and issued approximately 1.18 million shares of its common stock to Snow Time’s shareholders at a price of $5.07 per share, for total consideration of approximately $76.0 million. Financing for the cash portion of the purchase price consists of: a $50 million, two-year senior secured term loan from CAP 1 LLC, which will accrue interest at an annual rate of 6.95% and carry no prepayment penalty; and $20 million in proceeds from the sale of 20,000 shares of Series A cumulative convertible preferred stock and issuance of accompanying warrants to CAP 1 LLC pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement.

The Company also announced today that through October 31, 2018, Snow Time pass sales increased by approximately 20% on a unit basis and by approximately 19% on a revenue basis, compared to the prior year. Approximately 27% of Snow Time season pass holders took advantage of the Company’s buy-up offer and upgraded to the Peak Pass.

“We are delighted to kick off the winter season by welcoming Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop to the Peak Resorts family following the completion of our acquisition of Snow Time,” said Timothy D. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer of Peak Resorts. “Our entire team is excited to begin working with the Naylor family’s three beautiful resorts as we look to build on their legacy and further elevate the guest experience while introducing the Peak Pass and our other resorts to skiers across the Mid-Atlantic. The addition of the Snow Time properties to our growing portfolio of Northeast and Midwest operations further expands our reach into the affluent and densely populated Baltimore and Washington D.C. markets and provides our customers in the Northeast with three new complementary and conveniently located mountains where they can ski and ride as well as enjoy a four season resort experience.

“We have also seen strong acceptance for the Peak Pass as demonstrated by the 27% of Snow Time pass holders who elected to trade-up to our unlimited pass offering through October 31. We are very pleased that Snow Time’s season pass holders are upgrading to the Peak Pass at such healthy levels, reflecting what we believe is their excitement to have an opportunity to ski at their home resort while also exploring the Catskills in New York, the Green Mountains in Vermont and the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Since introducing the Peak Pass, our goal has been to provide an unlimited pass for all ages that offers unmatched value for guests who live within driving distance of our resorts and visit us frequently throughout the season. We believe this goal is a key driver of our success and we look forward to a great 2018/2019 ski season.”

The acquisition of Snow Time expands Peak Resorts’ portfolio to 17 resorts across the Northeast and Midwest through the addition of three ski resorts in Pennsylvania – Liberty Mountain Resort, Whitetail Resort and Roundtop Mountain Resort – which are within driving distance of the Baltimore-Washington D.C. market, a metropolitan region that comprises nearly 10 million people. Snow Time’s three resorts welcomed more than 600,000 visitors during the 2017/2018 ski season and offer a combined 65 trails, more than 325 skiable acres, and an average of approximately 700 vertical feet of terrain. Through the transaction, Peak Resorts now operates two 18-hole golf courses, a 115-room hotel and 22,000 square foot conference center at Liberty Mountain Resort, and more than 20 food and beverage locations across the three acquired Snow Time properties.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced the dosing of the first Chinese patient in its on-going global pivotal Phase 3 trial of Xynomic’s abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Dr. Jun Guo, Professor and Medical Director at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, is the leading principal investigator for this trial in China.

According to US International Trade Administration, China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, forecasted to grow from $108 billion in 2015 to $167 billion by 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. Total public and private healthcare expenditure reached $640 billion in 2015 and is expected to almost double to $1.1 trillion by 2020.

A global randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway of abexinostat + pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Currently, this trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and South Korea. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of RCC in Q1’2019.

“There are approximately 46,900 new cases of kidney cancer patients in China per year, according to Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Majority of patients develop resistance to pazopanib or other current standard-of-care therapies. Combining abexinostat with pazopanib has shown to reverse drug resistance in a Phase 1b study conducted by University of California, San Francisco and could significantly prolong patients' progression-free-survival time. We are excited to start the China arm of this on-going global trial and look forward to working with Dr. Jun Guo and other leading China kidney cancer specialists.” Mr. Y. Mark Xu, Chairman and CEO of Xynomic, commented.

In addition, Dr. Kapilan Rajagopalan has joined Xynomic as the Medical Monitor for clinical development. Prior to joining Xynomic, from 2016 to 2019 Dr. Rajagopalan worked as a Safety Case Manager and a Safety Operations Physician for Tata Consultancy Services, managing various pharmaceutical projects for Roche and Bayer. From 2014 to 2015, Dr. Rajagopalan was a MD/MBA intern at Humana. From 2012 to 2013, Dr. Rajagopalan was a family medicine resident physician at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. We believe that Dr. Rajagopalan’s experience in performing medical review for oncology pharmaceutical products and his MD education in the USA will enhance Xynomic’s medical monitoring function. Dr. Rajagopalan holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Cincinnati, graduating with Summa Cum Laude honors, a MBA from the University of Louisville with distinction, and a MD degree from the University of Cincinnati.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

(“Xynomic”, Nasdaq: XYN), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced that Xynomic has dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2 trial that combines abexinostat with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (“r/r MCL”) or relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“r/r DLBCL”) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). This trial will enroll approximately 40 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with r/r MCL or r/r DLBCL. This trial will also explore the biologic predictors of response and resistance to dual B-cell receptor (BCR) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. Janssen Biotech, Inc. is providing ibrutinib as part of the study, with Xynomic providing abexinostat and funding support for the trial being conducted at MSK.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has an annual incidence of approximately 6,500 in G7 countries, according to DR/Decision Resources, LLC. Ibrutinib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsed MCL and has response rates of 60-70% and median duration of response of 18 months. Abexinostat as a mono therapy has been shown to have response rate of 15.4% (7.7% complete response and 7.7% partial response) in r/r MCL patients. Researchers at MSK are testing whether abexinostat/ibrutinib combo could potentially improve response rates and duration of responses in r/r MCL patients, subject to the assessment upon the completion of the trial.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) subtype according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). Researchers at MSK have shown preclinical data demonstrating that dual targeting of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in the BCR pathway with ibrutinib and inhibition of MyD88-driven NF-kB activation with a HDAC inhibitor lead to synergistic anti-lymphoma activity in MyD88 mutated, ABC-subtype DLBCL both in vitro and in vivo.

Abexinostat is a novel HDAC inhibitor in global pivotal trials against NHL and renal cell carcinoma. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class BTK inhibitor jointly developed and commercialized as IMBRUVICA® by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company and has been approved for multiple hematological malignances and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD).

“The Report contains numerous errors of facts and misleading speculations that are libelous and we categorically deny such speculations.

We have not granted access to Hindenburg Research nor has Hindenberg Research ever contacted us to seek any clarification or explanation to the allegations made. These speculations have caused significant damage to our Company and we are resolved to take such actions necessary to defend ourselves and protect the interests of our shareholders. Additionally, we have instructed counsel and are working with the Nasdaq to explore our recourse against Hindenburg Research for making such irresponsible, baseless and libelous statements, including but not limited to instituting legal proceedings against them. We are committed to a high level of corporate governance and stand by the integrity of our financial statements and business operations,” said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

Our investigation concerns whether Yangtze has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report entitled “Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero. On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets Appear to be Largely Fabricated.” The Hindenburg report described Yangtze as “a scheme run by its Chairman & controlling shareholder to siphon money away from U.S. public markets.” Among other allegations, the Hindenburg report asserted that Yangtze’s “only operating entity has been declared insolvent in China and is involved in multiple undisclosed legal proceedings” and, citing “government-sourced documents and interviews with local officials, we believe that at least 77% of the company’s reported assets are fabricated.”

On this news, Yangtze’s share price fell by more than 28%, closing at $8.28 per share on December 7, 2018.

(NASDAQ: AMR “Alta Mesa Resources”), Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, OEM GP, LLC, Alta Mesa Finance Services Corp., Alta Mesa Services, LP and Oklahoma Energy Acquisitions, LLC, or collectively “the Companies”, today announced that they have filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Companies’ midstream platform, Kingfisher Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are not debtors and are not part of the Chapter 11 reorganization process.



Jim Hackett, Executive Chairman of Alta Mesa Resources, commented “We believe that the Chapter 11 process provides the best pathway for Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Holdings to restructure their respective balance sheets and to regain the financial flexibility necessary to develop their large position in the STACK in a manner that will maximize value for all their stakeholders.”

Despite considerable progress in reducing costs and improving well results, the Companies continue to operate against a historically challenging commodity price environment and a capital market that is highly constrained for energy companies. Ultimately, these factors made bankruptcy protection the best option for the Companies as they continue production operations while negotiating with their lenders.

Alta Mesa Resources also announced that its Board of Directors has approved several leadership changes, in addition to prior personnel decisions that the Companies have made. These changes, which are effective immediately, will help provide a more optimal management structure for the future and reduce general and administrative costs. Jim Hackett, who recently held the title of Interim Chief Executive Officer, has resumed his former role as Executive Chairman and will remain involved with the Board and management team in the restructuring process. Mark Castiglione, who was previously Interim Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Randy Limbacher, formerly Interim President, has accepted the role of Executive Vice President of Strategy, and will provide strategic counsel to the management team and Board. John Campbell, formerly Interim Chief Operating Officer, has become President and Chief Operating Officer. Kim Warnica will continue as Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, while John Regan will remain Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Hackett commented on the leadership changes, “When I assumed the Interim Chief Executive Officer role, I said that we would endeavor to find the right individual to lead the organization as it continues to progress forward with the development of our asset base. Mark Castiglione has demonstrated the skills required to lead this organization into the future, and he has the full support of the Board. Mark has both a financial and technical background and has served in engineering and business development roles in several large- and medium-sized public and private independent oil and gas companies. I am also very excited to have Randy Limbacher maintain his relationship with Alta Mesa Resources.”

(NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today provided an operational and financial update for its subsidiaries Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa Upstream”) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher Midstream”) and announced that Alta Mesa Upstream has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



Operational Update

Alta Mesa Upstream

First quarter 2019 production is estimated to be 37,800 BOE per day (48% oil, 71% liquids). Alta Mesa Upstream entered the year with six rigs actively working and reduced the rig count to zero by the end of January. A new development program was restarted in March by completing 16 drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) and operating two drilling rigs. The Company’s objective with the development program is to improve economic returns through a revised well spacing pattern of four or five wells per section, improved lateral placement and lower well costs. Under the reinvigorated development program, Alta Mesa Upstream has drilled 10 wells completing eight patterns (including the DUCs) and through May 17, 2019 had brought 22 new wells onto production. These wells are all tied into Kingfisher Midstream’s system.

The wells drilled and completed in 2019 have been averaging less than $3.0 million per well compared to $4.5 million per well experienced by the end of the previous drilling program. The Company has also made material progress on reducing lease operating expenses on a unit cost basis and lowering recurring general and administrative costs. More detail will be provided when it reports first quarter 2019 financial results.

Kingfisher Midstream

Kingfisher Midstream’s estimated first quarter volumes are summarized below.

System Gas Volumes 137 MMcf per day

Produced Water Volumes 85,000 Bbl per day

Crude Oil Volumes 6,600 Bbl per day

Proved Reserves

On February 25, 2019, Alta Mesa Upstream provided an initial estimate of 158 MMBoe for December 31, 2018 proved reserves. Based on its April 2019 assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and the uncertainty of funding the related development costs, Alta Mesa Upstream removed a total of 89 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2018, Alta Mesa Upstream had 69 MMBoe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 25 MMBbl of oil, 20 MMBbl of natural gas liquids and 144 Bcf of natural gas. The reserves have a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $813 million. Should Alta Mesa Upstream’s ability to fund the required development costs improve in the future, Alta Mesa Upstream expects to recognize all or a portion of the removed PUD reserves as proved.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update

At May 1, 2019, Alta Mesa Resources had debt with total face value of $1,061 million and $144 million of total liquidity, including $110 million of cash. Alta Mesa Upstream’s total debt was $868 million, comprised of $368 million utilized on its credit facility and $500 million of senior notes. The Company previously disclosed that Alta Mesa Upstream had drawn substantially all remaining capacity under its Credit Facility on April 1, 2019. As of May 1, Alta Mesa Upstream’s liquidity includes $95 million of cash.

Kingfisher Midstream had total borrowings on May 1, 2019 of $193 million within its available credit capacity of $225 million, resulting in liquidity of $47 million comprised of $32 million of available borrowing capacity and $15 million cash on hand. Until the delivery of audited 2018 and unaudited first quarter 2019 financial statements and the related compliance certificates, Kingfisher Midstream is limited to $225 million of borrowing capacity. Once those financials are delivered, the borrowing capacity, subject to continued covenant compliance, will return to $300 million.

The Company continues to make progress in finalizing its Form 10-K as well the first quarter 2019 Forms 10-Q for both Alta Mesa Resources and Alta Mesa Upstream but is unable to estimate the date at which these filings will be completed.

NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards

The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified Alta Mesa Resources on May 14, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and because the Company remains delinquent in filing its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Initial Delinquent Filing”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa Resources is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing by June 3, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Initial Delinquent Filing, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

Alta Mesa Resources is working to complete its annual and quarterly reports and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Provides Bank Borrowing Update; Retains Financial Advisor; Receives NASDAQ Notice Regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards","HOUSTON, April 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMR, “Alta Mesa” or the “Company”) today announced that Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“AMH”) had drawn substantially all of the remaining capacity under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility had a borrowing base of $370 million after the most recent borrowing base determination on April 1, 2019, which decreased the borrowing base by $30 million. The cash held following the draw, approximately $86 million, is intended for general corporate purposes.



James Hackett, the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In this challenging environment, we believe it is important to increase our liquidity to ensure we have adequate financial flexibility. We will continue to explore our options to strengthen our balance sheet, including options to address our indebtedness.”

Alta Mesa has retained Perella Weinberg Partners and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. as its financial advisor to assist with analyzing and considering financial alternatives.

Alta Mesa today also announced that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) notified the Company on April 2, 2019 that it is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Annual Report”).

The notification from NASDAQ notes that Alta Mesa is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing within 60 calendar days from the date of notification, or by June 1, 2019. Upon acceptance of the Company's compliance plan, NASDAQ is permitted to grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Annual Report's filing due date, or until September 30, 2019, for the Company to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements for continued listing. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NASDAQ’s exchange.

The Annual Report was not filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time period because the Company needs additional time to complete its financial statements and related disclosures. As previously announced, the Company expects to report material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company has taken additional time to ensure the accuracy of its 2018 financial information, to complete the required discussion and analysis of the business and to finalize the conclusions regarding the assessment of internal control. Although the Company is still completing its testing of internal control, it has not identified material misstatements to its previously filed financial information and believes that no restatements to historical periods will be required. While covenant relief was not attained during the borrowing base redetermination, the Company continues to be in discussions with its lenders under the Credit Facility. If unsuccessful in obtaining relief, the Company may be unable to comply with the terms of the Credit Facility during 2019, which would permit the lenders to cease making amounts available under the Credit Facility, to require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and to exercise other rights under the Credit Facility.

Alta Mesa is working to complete the Annual Report and intends to file it within the time frame required to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing standards.

Alta Mesa also announced today that NASDAQ notified the Company on April 3, 2019 that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the NASDAQ rules for continued listing. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ’s exchange. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 30, 2019, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's common shares must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 30, 2019, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common shares between now and September 30, 2019 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed compliance period. The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notice.

The delisting determination stated that Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company does not intend to appeal the Panel’s decision.

Mr. Bin Liu, acting CEO commented, “ChinaCache remains a publicly quoted company and will strictly adhere to SEC compliance protecting the interest of the Company’s investor base. Following the filing and acceptance of the delinquent quarterly and fiscal year end reports with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, ChinaCache intends to follow applicable Nasdaq listing standards, notwithstanding its delisting.

(NASDAQ: CCIH) on Behalf of ChinaCache Stockholders and Encourages ChinaCache Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, May 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is investigating potential claims against ChinaCache International Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: CCIH) on behalf of ChinaCache stockholders. Our investigation concerns whether ChinaCache has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.



Click here to participate in the action.

On April 29, 2019, ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for the 2018 fiscal year. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (“Chairman”), Song Wang (“Wang”), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

On May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019 because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the “NASDAQ Letter”). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache’s engagement of its new independent auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

(the “Company” or “Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton (the “Purchaser”) will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.



The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by Del Frisco’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as other customary closing conditions. Engaged Capital and certain of its affiliates, collectively holding nearly 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, have entered into voting agreements committing them to, among other things and subject to its terms, vote in favor of adopting the acquisition agreement.

“Over the course of our review, the Committee evaluated a full range of strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives to best serve the interests of our stockholders. After a thorough process, including considering Del Frisco’s current operations and future prospects, the Committee and the Board is confident that this transaction offers the most promising opportunity to realize the highest value for our stockholders,” said Joe Reece, Committee Chairman, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

“In consultation with our outside advisors, the Board has been evaluating several strategic and financial alternative options since December 2018.

Together with their deep operational expertise in the restaurant industry, I am confident L Catterton will be a great long-term partner,” said Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.

Del Frisco’s comprises four leading brands across two distinct business lines -- Del Frisco’s Grille and Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in the steak and grill category, and bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar in the upscale regionally-inspired cuisine category. Upon the close of the transaction, L Catterton plans to run the bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar businesses separately from the steakhouse brands in order to nurture the unique attributes of the brands.

“At L Catterton, we bring more than just capital – we bring significant operational expertise to our investments,” said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. “Over the last 30 years, L Catterton has invested in nearly 30 restaurant concepts globally to create a number of industry leaders. Del Frisco’s has four outstanding brands in two distinct and attractive categories – upscale regionally-inspired cuisine, and steak and grill. We’re excited to partner with the Company to harness the power of these brands by operating the upscale regionally-inspired brands separately from the steak and grill concepts.”

Announces Additional Synergies and Cost Savings","IRVING, Texas, May 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today announced a reduction in force (“RIF”) that is expected to generate significant pre-tax general and administrative cost savings of approximately $3.0 million in 2019 and $5 million on an annualized run-rate basis. This brings the total expected synergies from the Barteca acquisition and other cost savings to approximately $15 million.



Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer of Del Frisco's, said, “We have identified additional synergy opportunities to enhance our efficiencies and streamline our teams now that we have moved past our recent development ‘peak’ of 15 restaurant openings in the space of 10 months. We have now opened six of our planned eight restaurant openings for 2019 and, with the Barcelona and bartaco integration nearly complete and new IT systems now in place ahead of our original schedule, we are making necessary adjustments to move forward in a more dynamic way that will not impact our future growth plans. There is no change to our long term disciplined growth target of 10% to 12% new restaurant openings every year, which we are firmly on track to hit in full year 2019.”

Abdallah continued, “Notably, these reductions in G&A provide immediate cost savings and are on top of the more than $10 million in integration benefits that we have previously identified to be realized by 2020 or 2021. A significant majority of these savings will be in place on a run rate basis by the end of 2019.”

Abdallah added, “A reduction in force is a difficult but necessary step and we are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and support through this period of change.”

The RIF will impact all levels of the organization in Del Frisco’s restaurant support center, the field across three of the four brands and our contract support. In total, approximately 12% to 15% of G&A positions will be impacted during Q2 and Q3 of 2019. Customary transition assistance will be provided to affected employees. Del Frisco’s expects to incur total non-recurring restructuring charges of approximately $0.3 million to $0.5 million on a pre-tax basis for severance payments and other termination costs.

With the completion of six of eight planned 2019 openings through the first half of 2019, there is stronger line of sight to full year pre-opening costs and capital expenditure. The Company is lowering its annual outlook for pre-opening costs to $4.5 million to $5.5 million (previous range was $5 million to $7 million). It also expects to be close to the middle of its guidance range of $25 million to $35 million in capital expenditure with improved capital cost management, notably at the Barcelona and bartaco brands.

Abdallah concluded, “With respect to the strategic alternatives review process announced in December 2018, our board of directors continues to work with Piper Jaffrey & Co., our financial advisor, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, our legal advisor, in a diligent manner.” No assurances can be made that the review will result in any particular outcome.

Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results","IRVING, Texas, Aug. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 25, 2019.



On June 24, 2019, Del Frisco’s announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement under which affiliates of L Catterton, a consumer-focused private equity firm, will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $650 million. Del Frisco’s stockholders will receive $8.00 per share, representing a 22% percent premium to the closing share price on December 19, 2018, the last trading day prior to Company’s announcement of a strategic alternatives process, and a premium of approximately 21% to the 30-day volume weighted average price ended on June 21, 2019.

The agreement was unanimously approved by Del Frisco’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) following a thorough review of a full range of strategic alternatives by the Board with the assistance of the Board’s Strategic Alternatives Review Committee (the “Committee”), which was first announced on December 20, 2018. The transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to approval by Del Frisco’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

In view of the pending transaction, Del Frisco’s has withdrawn its fiscal year 2019 guidance and long-term outlook and will not host a conference call to discuss these second quarter 2019 financial results.

Key Highlights from the 13-Week Second Quarter 2019 Compared to the 13-Week Second Quarter 2018 Include:

Consolidated revenues increased 73.9% to $131.7 million from $75.7 million due primarily to $21.1 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $28.2 million in contributions from bartaco.

The additional costs were primarily related to the addition of Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco, and additional compensation costs, including stock-based compensation related to growth in the number of restaurant support center and regional management-level personnel to support recent and anticipated growth.

We also incurred non-recurring consulting project costs of $3.4 million, non-recurring legal expense of $2.0 million, reorganization severance costs of $0.5 million, and donations of $0.2 million as set out in the Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Reconciliation attached.

GAAP net loss was $6.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018.

Adjusted net loss* was $2.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to adjusted net income* of $3.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA* increased 60.3% to $13.1 million from $8.2 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 10.0% from 10.8%.

Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased $12.1 million, or 74.9%, to $28.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to $5.2 million in contributions from Barcelona and $6.9 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA* increased to 21.5% from 21.4%.

Non-GAAP Measures

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted EBIDTA and restaurant-level EBITDA. Adjusted net (loss) income represents GAAP net loss plus the sum of GAAP income tax expense (benefit), lease termination and closing costs, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, reorganization severance, non-recurring legal expenses, donations, non-recurring corporate expenses, and discontinued operations minus income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 68% during 2019, and (52)% during 2018. We believe that this non-GAAP operating measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors as it excludes certain non-operating related expenditures. Adjusted EBIDTA is calculated by adding back to operating income, pre-opening costs, donations, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, non-recurring legal costs, reorganization severance, lease termination and closing costs, and depreciation and amortization. Restaurant-level EBITDA is calculated by adding back to adjusted EBIDTA general and administrative expenses. We believe that these operating measures also represent useful internal measures of performance. Restaurant-level EBITDA margin represents restaurant-level EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. Adjusted net (loss) income per share represents income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on divestitures and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe that this measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors.

Accordingly, we include these non-GAAP measures so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing our underlying performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these measures as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP measurements. The following tables include a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and operating income to restaurant-level EBITDA.

Prior to the Barteca Acquisition, starting in Q4 of 2017 and continuing through the first half of 2018, Barteca management recognized insurance settlement proceeds from a location-specific incident as a reduction to restaurant operating expenses, which therefore increased restaurant-level EBITDA margins by the amount of those proceeds for that period of time. Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company. Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

Reports First Quarter 2019 Results","IRVING, Texas, May 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Del Frisco’s”) (NASDAQ: DFRG) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 26, 2019. We also reiterated guidance for the fiscal year 2019, which is a 53-week period ending on December 31, 2019.



Given the sale of Sullivan’s Steakhouse during fiscal 2018, operating results for Sullivan’s Steakhouse are included in discontinued operations for the 13 weeks ended March 27, 2018. Numbers below for the 13 weeks ended March 27, 2018, are therefore for continuing operations unless otherwise stated.

Key Highlights from the 13-Week First Quarter 2019 Compared to the 13-Week First Quarter 2018 Include:

Consolidated revenues increased 64.1% to $120.4 million from $73.3 million due primarily to $17.4 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $20.6 million in contributions from bartaco.



Total comparable restaurant sales increased 1.3%.

GAAP net loss of $18.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $0.0 million, or $0.00 per diluted share.

Adjusted net loss* of $3.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income* of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.



Adjusted EBITDA* increased 5.0% to $7.1 million from $6.8 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 330 basis points to 5.9% from 9.2%.



GAAP operating loss of $11.8 million, compared to GAAP operating income of $0.3 million.

Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased 57.9% to $22.7 million from $14.4 million due primarily to $3.6 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $4.3 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA margin decreased 70 basis points to 18.9% from 19.6%, primarily due to inefficiencies from new restaurant openings.



* Adjusted net loss/income, adjusted EBITDA, and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP net income and operating (loss)/income, respectively, and a discussion of why we consider them useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.

Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer of Del Frisco's, said, “We experienced a sequential improvement in comparable sales across all four brands during the first quarter of 2019. Barcelona and bartaco delivered low and mid-single digit growth, respectively, Del Frisco’s Grille was slightly positive, while the Double Eagle was only modestly negative, and would also have been positive without planned sales transfer from the Boston Seaport restaurant to Boston Back Bay opening last summer which impacted comparable sales by 110 basis points. The Double Eagle and Del Frisco’s Grille both continue to capitalize on their significant opportunities to generate private dining sales, which grew 4.6% and 2.0%, respectively on a comparable basis. We attribute their traction to improved banquet menu offerings, flawless execution, and effectiveness in building relationships with local businesses and luxury hotels through impactful marketing campaigns.”

Abdallah continued, “Our 2018 new restaurant openings and our latest four openings during the first quarter of 2019 are collectively off to strong starts and we are building lasting relationships with our guests through unforgettable dining experiences while positioning these restaurants to hit their three-year ROIC targets of 35% to 40%. However, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter last year, new restaurant inefficiencies weighed heavily on our results at Double Eagle and bartaco where we have seen particularly significant recent growth.”

Abdallah added, “During the first quarter of 2019, our 21 non-comparable restaurants, representing over 25% of our total restaurant base, had a 270 basis point impact to restaurant-level EBITDA margins. This compared to a 290 basis point impact from non-comparable restaurants during the fourth quarter last year. The new restaurant inefficiencies were most notable in the Double Eagle and bartaco, which have experienced the fastest growth recently, with non-comparable restaurants having a 520 basis point impact on restaurant level EBITDA in each brand. With new restaurant margins improving from period to period as they mature and six of our planned seven to eight new restaurants opened thus far, we anticipate the impact of new restaurant inefficiencies on our total restaurant-level EBITDA margins to begin moderating in the second half of 2019.”

Abdallah concluded, “The Barcelona and bartaco integration is nearly complete and we intend to finalize the process ahead of the original 12-18 month timeframe. All of our brands are now online with our new Human Resources and payroll system and we expect to transition Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco to our new accounting system next month. We will begin to recognize more of the $10 million in integration benefits, up from the original $3 million to $5 million, in the second half of this year when the transition of back office systems and support is complete. The full amount will be realized by 2020 or 2021.”

Review of First Quarter 2019 Operating Results

Consolidated revenues increased $47.1 million, or 64.1%, to $120.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $73.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. All results exclude any contributions from Sullivan’s Steakhouse, which was sold in the third quarter of 2018, and which sale is reflected as discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2018. The increase is due primarily to $17.4 million in contributions from Barcelona Wine Bar and $20.6 million in contributions from bartaco, which were acquired on June 27, 2018.

Comparable Restaurant Sales

Total Double Eagle Del Frisco’s Grille Barcelona bartaco Comparable Restaurant Sales 1.3 % (0.4 )% 0.2 % 3.7 % 6.7 % Customer Counts (0.6 )% (1.5 )% (6.9 )% 3.6 % 5.5 % Average Check 1.9 % 1.1 % 7.1 % 0.1 % 1.2 %

As a percentage of consolidated revenues, general and administrative costs increased to 13.6% from 10.6%. The additional costs were primarily related to the addition of Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco, and additional compensation costs, including stock-based compensation related to growth in the number of restaurant support center and regional management-level personnel to support recent and anticipated growth. Included in this general and administrative costs total were also $0.4 million of non-recurring legal expenses and $0.4 million of non-recurring corporate expenses as set out in the Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Reconciliation attached. Finally we incurred approximately $0.5 million in costs related to our annual General Managers conference in the first quarter of 2019. We expect that full general and administrative cost synergies from the Barteca acquisition will only be realized beginning in the second half of 2019 as we complete the back office integration.

GAAP net loss was $18.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to GAAP net income of $0.0 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018.

Adjusted net loss* was $3.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to adjusted net income* of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. Adjustments include costs totaling $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2019 consisting of consulting project costs of $4.5 million, lease termination and closing costs of $2.9 million, reorganization severance costs of $0.3 million, the aforementioned non-recurring legal and corporate expenses each totaling $0.4 million respectively, and a change in tax benefit of $6.4 million.

Adjusted EBITDA* increased 5.0% to $7.1 million from $6.8 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 330 basis points to 5.9% from 9.2%.

Restaurant-level EBITDA* increased $8.3 million, or 57.9%, to $22.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to $3.6 million in contributions from Barcelona and $4.3 million in contributions from bartaco. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant-level EBITDA* decreased to 18.9% from 19.6% primarily due to inefficiencies from new restaurant openings.

Recent Development

Fiscal Year 2019 Guidance & Long-Term Growth Outlook

The following statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to the statement below regarding Forward-Looking Statements and our recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition.

For the 53-week fiscal year 2019, which ends on December 31, 2019, we are providing the following outlook.

Total comparable restaurant sales of 0% to 1.5%.

Seven to eight restaurant openings, consisting of one Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse, two to three Barcelona Wine Bars, and three to four bartaco restaurants. Six restaurants have already opened year-to-date.



Restaurant-level EBITDA** of 20.0% to 22.0% of consolidated revenues.

General and administrative costs of approximately $53 million to $55 million, which excludes items we consider non-recurring in nature.



Pre-opening expenses of $5 million to $7 million.



Net capital expenditures, after tenant allowances, of $25 million to $35 million.



Adjusted EBITDA** of $58 million to $66 million.

** Restaurant-level EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

By the end of fiscal year 2023, we are targeting generation on an annual basis of at least $800 million in consolidated revenues and $130 million in adjusted EBITDA**. To achieve these long-term targets, we would need to satisfy the following key annual goals:

Consolidated revenue growth of at least 10%.



Total comparable restaurant sales growth of 0% to 2%.



Total net restaurant growth of 10% to 12% annually.



Maintaining strong restaurant-level EBITDA** margins.



General and administrative cost leverage.



Adjusted EBITDA** growth of at least 15%.

We are also targeting net debt to adjusted EBITDA** of approximately 3x by the end of fiscal year 2021 and 2x by the end of fiscal year 2023.

**A reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and GAAP measures for adjusted EBITDA, restaurant-level EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to the potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures and other structural changes or their probable significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.

Non-GAAP Measures

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP adjusted net income, adjusted net (loss) income per share, adjusted EBIDTA and restaurant-level EBITDA. Adjusted net (loss) income represents GAAP net loss plus the sum of GAAP income tax expense (benefit), lease termination and closing costs, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, reorganization severance, non-recurring legal expenses, donations, non-recurring corporate expenses, and discontinued operations minus income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 69% during 2019, and 4% during 2018. We believe that this non-GAAP operating measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors as it excludes certain non-operating related expenditures. Adjusted EBIDTA is calculated by adding back to operating income, pre-opening costs, donations, consulting project costs, acquisition costs, non-recurring legal costs, reorganization severance, lease termination and closing costs, and depreciation and amortization. Restaurant-level EBITDA is calculated by adding back to adjusted EBIDTA general and administrative expenses. We believe that these operating measures also represent useful internal measures of performance. Restaurant-level EBITDA margin represents restaurant-level EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. Adjusted net (loss) income per share represents income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on divestitures and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe that this measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors.

Accordingly, we include these non-GAAP measures so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing our underlying performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these measures as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP measurements. The following tables include a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and operating income to restaurant-level EBITDA.

Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company.

Under US GAAP rules, the Company recognizes insurance settlement proceeds from business interruptions as a separate line item below other operating activity in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and, therefore, such proceeds are not included within restaurant-level EBITDA as calculated by the Company. Accordingly, consistent with the Company’s accounting policy, 2017 insurance settlement proceeds have been adjusted out of restaurant operating expenses and restaurant-level EBITDA as originally factored in by Barteca management prior to the Barteca Acquisition.

New Spin-Off Record Date Set for July 15, 2019



MISSION VIEJO, Calif. and TORRANCE, Calif., July 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYND) , a predictive analytics company aimed at improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics, and Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (“Emmaus”), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today provided an update on the planned merger and spin-off transaction announced on January 7, 2019. The respective special stockholder meetings will be held today, July 9, 2019, to consider approval of the proposed merger and spin-off transaction. Subject to approval by holders of record of the companies at the respective special stockholder meetings, MYnd will issue a number of shares of common stock to the current Emmaus shareholders, which will result in MYnd shareholders retaining 5.9% of the fully diluted shares of the 'New Emmaus' post-closing and a pro rata distribution of one share of Telemynd’s common stock for each share of MYnd common stock held at the end of trading on July 16, 2019. The companies have set a new Spin-Off Record Date of July 15, 2019 in order to comply with certain NASDAQ and DTC requirements. Those individuals who hold shares at the close of trading on the 16th of July will receive the Telemynd dividend. MYnd shares will trade ex-dividend on July 17, which means that persons who purchase MYnd shares on July 17 will not receive shares of Telemynd.

It is expected that on July 16 and July 17, the necessary steps will occur to spin off Telemynd with the current MYnd assets, effectuate the merger and any adjustments needed to meet NASDAQ listing standards and commence trading on July 18, 2019 under the new symbol “EMMA.”

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “We are very grateful for this opportunity to merge with MYnd Analytics. The anticipated listing on Nasdaq via the merger with MYnd Analytics is an important step to maximize value for shareholders. We look forward to sharing with the public markets our progress on the market acceptance of Endari, which is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years and older. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other major clinical indications such as diverticulosis.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are pleased with the progress of the merger and spin-off transaction, which remains on track to close before the end of this month, subject to approval of shareholders. We believe this transaction will drive significant value for all shareholders, and we will provide further updates following the respective shareholder meetings.”

It is anticipated that the surviving company will change its name to Emmaus and receive a new ticker symbol to reflect the name change. The company expects to meet all applicable requirements for initial listing upon completion of the merger and, therefore, expects to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval from the shareholders of each company and Nasdaq approval. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as a financial advisor to Emmaus in connection with this transaction.

In connection with the transaction, MYnd Analytics intends to transfer all of its assets (including cash and its equity interest in Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services, LLC) and liabilities into its wholly-owned subsidiary, MYnd Analytics California, and to distribute the shares of MYnd Analytics California to MYnd Analytics’ shareholders as of a record date prior to the merger, which will be set prior to the merger effective time. MYnd Analytics expects that the MYnd Analytics California subsidiary, following the spinoff, will commence trading as an independent company at a date to be announced. Under the leadership of its new CEO, Patrick Herguth, the MYnd Analytics California spin off intends to continue operating, integrating and growing its technology-enabled telepsychiatry and teletherapy businesses in order to provide enhanced access to behavioral health services, improve patient outcomes and help lower the costs associated with behavioral health issues. MYnd-Arcadian customers include major health plans, health systems, and community-based organizations. The parties do not expect there to be any disruption to the existing business or customers.

Emmaus is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, including those in the rare and orphan disease categories. Its lead prescription product, Endari, demonstrated positive clinical results in a completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell disease and received FDA approval in July 2017. Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. The results of the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on July 19th, 2018.

Emmaus launched Endari in the United States in early 2018 and has experienced strong market uptake. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Additionally, Emmaus has distribution agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors, making Endari available to selected pharmacies nationwide.

Outside the United States, the treatment is currently available through an Early Access Program for sickle cell disease patients that have exhausted other treatment options. Emmaus is currently in the process of seeking marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency for its medication. Emmaus has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA which provides protection from competition in the United States and Orphan Medicinal designation from the European Commission for protection in the European Union.

Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, CEO and Chairman of Emmaus, stated, “The merger with MYnd Analytics, and concurrent Nasdaq listing, will be a major milestone for the company, and builds on our recent progress, including the FDA approval of Endari, the publication of our Phase 3 results in The New England Journal of Medicine , Medicaid coverage, the addition of major pharmaceutical distributors, and a presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 Annual Meeting. Just as important as these accomplishments was the launch and market acceptance of Endari – the first medication (FDA approved) for sickle cell disease in almost 20 years. Endari addresses a $3 billion global market. In addition to the treatment of sickle cell disease, we believe our platform technology has the potential to address other clinical indications such as diverticulosis. Through this merger, we believe we can maximize value for shareholders and we are grateful to MYnd for this opportunity.”

Robin Smith, Chairman of MYnd Analytics, commented, “We are excited to announce this definitive merger agreement with Emmaus, whereby the MYnd shareholders will own equity in Emmaus, and upon our expected spin-off, will continue to own 100% of the predictive analytics and telemedicine business, which we expect to begin operations as a new standalone public company. We are quite encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to further integrating and accelerating the growth of our offerings under Patrick Herguth’s leadership. We plan to provide further details on the new operational direction, branding, and growth strategy in the coming weeks and months.”

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle Cell Disease is an orphan disease with significant unmet medical needs, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide.

II-VI has agreed with SAMR that it will operate separately, for a period expected to be three years, the wavelength selective switch business of Finisar. The clearance decision from SAMR satisfies the closing condition set forth in the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger regarding the receipt of antitrust approvals. II-VI expects the closing of its acquisition of Finisar (the “Merger”) to occur on or about September 24, 2019.



In accordance with the merger agreement governing the Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), holders of Finisar common stock and holders of certain restricted stock units issued by Finisar (collectively, the “Voting Securities”) have previously been provided the opportunity to elect the form of Merger consideration they wished to receive for each Voting Security they hold, being either (i) $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration”). The deadline for that election was July 15, 2019 (the “Election Deadline”), and the total amount of cash and II-VI Common Stock to be paid in the aggregate by II-VI is fixed. Holders of Voting Securities are deemed to have made no election if they failed to make an election, or revoked a prior election without making a new election, by the Election Deadline, or if their election materials were not received in proper form by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”) prior to the Election Deadline.

Holders of Voting Securities who made no election, or have validly withdrawn their election, are deemed to have elected the Mixed Consideration. Holders of Voting Securities who have validly made, and not previously withdrawn, an election prior to the Election Deadline regarding the form of merger consideration they wish to receive in the Merger will have until 5:00 p.m., New York time, on September 20, 2019 to withdraw their election if they wish to receive the Mixed Consideration. All other holders of Voting Securities who have validly made an election that is not so withdrawn will receive either the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration they have elected, in each case prorated as described below.

The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to automatic proration so that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of II-VI Common Stock paid to all holders of Voting Securities as a group will not change as a result of these elections.

Establishing the date of the Election Deadline is not intended, however, to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (“SAMR”).



To make an election, all Finisar stockholders who have not previously made their cash, stock, or mixed consideration elections, or who desire to revoke a prior election and make a new election, must submit their properly completed and signed election forms with respect to their shares, together with all required documents and materials set forth in the election form and the instructions thereto, to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), the exchange agent for the Merger, by the Election Deadline. Finisar stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may be subject to an earlier deadline and should read carefully the instructions from their bank, broker or nominee regarding making elections for their shares. Finisar stockholders with questions should contact AST at (877) 248-6417 or (718) 921-8317.

In accordance with the previously announced merger agreement, Finisar stockholders may elect to receive either $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration”), 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI, no par value (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Election Consideration”), or a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Election Consideration”). Finisar stockholders may also choose to make no election with respect to their shares, and will be deemed to have made no election with respect to their shares if they fail to make an election, revoke a prior election without making a new election, or their election materials are not received in proper form by AST prior to the Election Deadline, in which case such stockholders will receive the Mixed Election Consideration. The Cash Election Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration are subject to automatic proration adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement such that the aggregate merger consideration paid to all Finisar stockholders as a group will consist of approximately 60% cash and 40% II-VI Common Stock (assuming a II-VI Common Stock per share price equal to the closing price as of November 8, 2018), as further described in the merger agreement and the joint proxy statement/prospectus provided to Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders in connection with the special meeting of Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders, each of which was held on March 26, 2019.

Under the terms of the merger agreement for the Merger, the deadline for Finisar stockholders to submit their elections is to be 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the date which the parties to the merger agreement agree is as near as practicable to two business days prior to the closing date of the Merger. The Election Deadline has been chosen by II-VI and Finisar in accordance with the merger agreement in order to provide sufficient notice to enable Finisar stockholders to elect their preferred form of merger consideration, while still enabling the parties to consummate the Merger within two business days following the satisfaction of the various conditions to the Merger. The date selected for the Election Deadline does not, however, in any way guarantee or indicate that the Merger will actually close two business days after the Election Deadline, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or certainty of the closing of the Merger. The date of the Election Deadline also is not intended to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by SAMR, and the parties continue to anticipate that SAMR’s approval of the Merger will be received mid calendar year 2019. It is possible, however, that factors outside the control of the parties could result in SAMR’s approval being received at a different time or not at all. II-VI and Finisar reserve the right to set a revised election deadline.

The deadline for making that election was 5:00 p.m., New York time, on July 15, 2019 (the “Election Deadline”).



Based on available information as of the Election Deadline, the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Finisar common stock and Participating RSUs (collectively, the “Voting Securities”) was 120,730,839. In accordance with the merger agreement governing the Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), holders of Voting Securities could have elected to receive (i) $26.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of common stock of II-VI (the “II-VI Common Stock”) (the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration”). Holders of Voting Securities are deemed to have made no election if they failed to make an election, or revoked a prior election without making a new election, or if their election materials were not received in proper form by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), prior to the Election Deadline. Holders of Voting Securities who made no election are deemed to have elected the Mixed Consideration. The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to automatic proration so that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of II-VI Common Stock paid to all holders of Voting Securities as a group will not change as a result of these elections. It will consist of approximately 60% cash and 40% II-VI Common Stock (assuming a per share price of II-VI Common Stock equal to the closing price as of November 8, 2018, which was $46.88 per share), as further described in the Merger Agreement and in the joint proxy statement/prospectus provided to Finisar and II-VI shareholders in connection with the special meetings of Finisar stockholders and II-VI shareholders, each of which was held on March 26, 2019.

The election results were as follows:

Holders of 96,820,703 Voting Securities, or approximately 80.2% of the Voting Securities, elected to receive the Cash Consideration;



Holders of 1,716,027 Voting Securities, or approximately 1.4% of the Voting Securities, elected to receive the Stock Consideration;



Holders of 3,205,674 Voting Securities, or approximately 2.7% of the Voting Securities, affirmatively elected to receive the Mixed Consideration; and



Holders of 18,988,435 Voting Securities, or approximately 15.7% of the Voting Securities, made no election and therefore are deemed to have elected to receive the Mixed Consideration.

The final allocations of the consideration payable in connection with the Merger will be calculated using the formulas set forth in the Merger Agreement. The calculation of the applicable proration adjustments with respect to the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration is based, in part, on the number of outstanding Voting Securities as of the effective time of the Merger, and also will change as a result of Finisar stockholders transferring their Finisar shares or withdrawing their consideration election. Accordingly, the applicable proration adjustments cannot be calculated at this time and may differ from the results that would be obtained if information as of the Election Deadline were used to calculate the proration adjustments.

As previously announced, the date of the Election Deadline was not intended to indicate the expected timing of approval of the Merger by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (“SAMR”). II-VI and Finisar continue to anticipate that SAMR’s approval of the Merger will be received mid calendar year 2019. It is possible, however, that factors outside the control of the parties could result in SAMR’s approval being received at a different time or not at all, and neither II-VI nor Finisar are able to estimate accurately when that will be. Consequently, Finisar and II-VI are permitting holders of Voting Securities who made an election prior to the Election Deadline to withdraw some or all of the Voting Securities as to which they made an election in order to transfer or sell their shares or for any other reason. Any withdrawal of Voting Securities after the Election Deadline will result in a deemed Mixed Consideration election with respect to such Voting Securities. Holders of Voting Securities will continue to be able to withdraw their elections until the time that Finisar and II-VI provide notice that election withdrawals no longer will be permitted in anticipation of consummating the Merger. II-VI and Finisar currently expect that there will be no additional election period and, once an election has been withdrawn, a subsequent election will not be permitted with respect to the related Voting Securities. Elections made by holders of Voting Securities prior to the Election Deadline that are not validly withdrawn will remain in effect.

In order to withdraw an existing election, record holders of Voting Securities must submit their properly completed and signed withdrawal forms with respect to their Voting Securities, together with all required documents and materials, to AST, the exchange agent for the Merger. Finisar stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee should contact that bank, broker or nominee for the appropriate instructions with respect to how withdraw Voting Securities from their existing elections. Finisar stockholders with questions should contact AST at (877) 248-6417 or (718) 921-8317.

_____________

(a) In evaluating the operating performance of Finisar’s business, Finisar management utilizes financial measures that exclude certain charges and credits required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, that are considered by management to be outside of Finisar’s core ongoing operating results. A reconciliation of Finisar’s non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as additional related information, can be found under the heading “Finisar Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Revenue Details for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2020:

Revenues for datacom applications decreased by $19.4 million, or (8.9)%, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily as the result of a decline in VCSELs arrays for 3D applications due to lower demand resulting from the timing of the new product cycle of a key customer, as well as lower sales of fibre channel transceivers.



Revenues for telecom applications decreased by $5.6 million, or (6.2)%, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of a decline in sales of wavelength selective switches.

SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This press release contains forward-looking statement concerning Finisar’s expected financial performance. These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our business and industry, and the markets and customers we serve, and they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Finisar assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Examples of such risks include those associated with: the uncertainty of customer demand for Finisar’s products; the rapidly evolving markets for Finisar’s products and uncertainty regarding the development of these markets; Finisar’s historical dependence on sales to a limited number of customers and fluctuations in the mix of products and customers in any period; ongoing new product development and introduction of new and enhanced products; the challenges of rapid growth followed by periods of contraction; intensive competition; the risk that our pending merger with II-VI does not close, due to the failure of one or more conditions to closing; uncertainty as to the market value of the II-VI merger consideration to be paid in the merger; the risk that required governmental approvals of the merger (including China antitrust approval) will not be obtained or that such approvals will be delayed beyond current expectations; the risk of litigation in respect of either Finisar or II-VI or the merger; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain our customer, supplier, key personnel and other strategic relationships. Further information regarding these and other risks relating to Finisar’s business is set forth in Finisar’s annual report on Form 10-K (filed June 14, 2019) and quarterly SEC filings.

FINISAR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES



In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Finisar provides the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP income and non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental information regarding Finisar’s operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges of a non-cash nature or that occur relatively infrequently and/or that management considers to be outside of our ongoing core operating results. Management believes that tracking non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share provides management and the investment community with valuable insight into our ongoing core current operations, our ability to generate cash and the underlying business trends that are affecting our performance. These non-GAAP measures are used by both management and our Board of Directors, along with the comparable GAAP information, in evaluating our current performance and planning our future business activities. In particular, management finds it useful to exclude non-cash charges in order to better correlate our operating activities with our ability to generate cash from operations and to exclude certain cash charges as a means of more accurately predicting our liquidity requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when used in conjunction with our GAAP financial information, also allow investors to better evaluate our financial performance in comparison to other periods and to other companies in our industry.

In calculating non-GAAP gross profit in this release, we have excluded the following items from cost of revenues in applicable periods in this release:

Amortization of acquired technology (non-cash charges related to technology obtained in acquisitions);

Stock-based compensation expense (non-cash charges);

Impairment of long-lived/intangible assets (non-cash charges);

Reduction in force costs and other restructuring charges (non-core cash charges);

Acquisition related retention payments (non-core cash charges); and

Inventory write-off related to discontinued products (non-cash charges).

In calculating non-GAAP operating income in this release, we have excluded the same items to the extent they are classified as operating expenses, and have also excluded the following items in applicable periods in this release:

Discontinued product services fees (non-core cash charges);

Acquisition related costs (non-core cash charges);

Litigation settlements and resolutions and related costs (non-core cash charges);

Amortization of purchased intangibles (non-cash charges);

Start-up cash costs related to our Sherman VCSEL fab until we begin commercial production; and

Impairment of long-lived assets/intangible assets (non-cash charges).

In calculating non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share in this release, we have also excluded the following items in applicable periods in this release:

Imputed interest expenses on convertible debt (non-cash charges);

Imputed interest related to restructuring (non-cash charges);

Other interest income (non-core benefits);

Gains and losses on sales of assets and other miscellaneous (non-cash losses and cash gains related to the periodic disposal of assets no longer required for current activities);

Dollar denominated foreign exchange transaction losses (gains) (non-cash charges or benefits); and

Amortization of debt issuance costs (non-cash charges).

In addition, in this release we have adjusted non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share for the difference between GAAP income taxes and non-GAAP income taxes.

A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information to the corresponding GAAP information is set forth below:

Third Fiscal Quarter 2019 Results:

Interest income increased by $0.1 million, or 0.5%, due to a $4.3 million increase in the weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing portfolio, partially offset by the decrease in the weighted average yield quarter over quarter. Other income increased by $0.3 million, or 21.3%, quarter over quarter, primarily driven by prepayment fees received associated with the exit of IA Tech, LLC. Total expenses increased by 2.6% period over period, primarily due to an increase in incentive fees due to higher pre-incentive fee net investment income.

Net Investment Income for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was $6.2 million, an increase of 3.3% as compared to the prior quarter, or $0.21 per share.

The Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was $8.9 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to a net increase of $9.3 million, or $0.33 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. The current quarter increase was primarily due to $3.6 million of net unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by an $0.8 million net realized loss on investments.

Subsequent Events: Subsequent to June 30, 2019, the following significant events occurred:

Portfolio Activity: In July 2019, our debt investment in PIC 360, LLC was repaid at par for net proceeds of $2.6 million. In August 2019, we invested an additional $5.0 million in Sea Link International IRB, Inc, an existing portfolio company, through secured second lien debt.

Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Common Share Distribution per Series 2024 Term Preferred Share July 22, 2019 July 31, 2019 $ 0.07 $ 0.125 August 20, 2019 August 30, 2019 0.07 0.125 September 17, 2019 September 30, 2019 0.07 0.125 Total for the Quarter $ 0.21 $ 0.375

Comments from Gladstone Capital’s President, Bob Marcotte: “We entered the quarter well prepared for the elevated level of prepayment activity we experienced which allowed us to increase our assets and net interest income for the period while higher prepayment and other fee income drove much of the investment income increase for the quarter. Notwithstanding the competitive market conditions for senior debt, we are continuing to outpace prepayments and prudently grow our investment portfolio. In the near term we will continue to focus our efforts on deploying our approximate $75 million of incremental investment capacity to grow our core net interest earnings and enhance the returns to our shareholders.”

Invested $49.9 million in six new portfolio companies and $9.4 million in existing portfolio companies. Received $8.9 million in repayments including the payoff of two debt investments at par. Debt Issuance: In November 2018, we completed a public offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023, inclusive of the overallotment, for net proceeds of $55.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

In November 2018, we completed a public offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023, inclusive of the overallotment, for net proceeds of $55.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Distributions and Dividends: For each of October, November, and December 2018, paid monthly distributions to common stockholders ($0.07 per common share) and monthly dividends to preferred stockholders ($0.125 per share of the Company’s 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock).

First Fiscal Quarter 2019 Results:

Interest income increased by $0.8 million, or 7.7%, primarily due to increases in both the weighted average yield and the weighted average balance of our interest bearing portfolio quarter over quarter. Other income decreased by $0.2 million, quarter over quarter due to a decrease in dividend income. Total expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 10.6%, compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in interest expense driven by an increase in the average debt outstanding used to fund the new investments made during the quarter ended December 31, 2018.

Net Investment Income for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was $6.0 million, an increase of 1.4% as compared to the prior quarter, or $0.21 per share.

The Net Decrease in Net Assets Resulting from Operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was $3.7 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $9.9 million, or $0.35 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The current quarter decrease was driven primarily by $26.9 million of net realized loss from the restructure of Francis Drilling Fluids, Ltd. (“FDF”), partially offset by $17.2 million of net unrealized appreciation during the period associated with the reversal of accumulated unrealized depreciation on FDF.

Subsequent Events: Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the following significant events occurred:

Portfolio Activity: In January 2019, our investment in Merlin International, Inc. paid off, generating net cash proceeds of $20.9 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $20.0 million at par and success fee income of $0.6 million and a prepayment fee of $0.3 million.

Comments from Gladstone Capital’s President, Bob Marcotte: “Strong net originations and higher average investment yields lifted our interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 to a new record, and position us well to absorb potential prepayments and continue to grow our net investment income. The conclusion of the restructuring of FDF was difficult; however, the balance of the portfolio is performing well despite the valuation erosion associated with the liquidity sell-off in the syndicated loan market at December 31, 2018 much of which has already recovered. The plan for the balance of fiscal 2019 is to continue to drive interest income by remaining reasonably fully invested while generating higher fee income associated with increased prepayments to enable us to enhance the returns to our shareholders in the coming quarters.”

(Nasdaq: HUNT) (the ""Company"" or ""Hunter""), a fintech company located in China, which is primarily focused on connecting investors and borrowers and providing multi-scenario investment analysis to platform users to meet their diversified investment needs, today announced that it has received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel"") has determined to suspend trading in the Company's securities effective at the open of business on Friday, April 26, 2019. The Panel’s determination was based upon the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum 300 round lot shareholder requirement, which became applicable to the Company upon the closing of its business combination with NCF Wealth Group, and the Panel’s view that the Company had not made sufficient progress towards compliance with that requirement to date. Because the Nasdaq staff halted trading in the Company’s securities so soon after the closing of the business combination, the Company was not afforded the opportunity to satisfy the 300 round lot shareholder requirement.



The Company expects its securities to trade in the over-the-counter market in the near future. The notification indicates that Nasdaq will only move to formally effect the delisting of the Company’s securities from the exchange by filing a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") once all applicable reviews and appeals periods have lapsed.

The Company intends to appeal in an effort to maintain its listing on Nasdaq and resolve the 300 round lot shareholder requirement as soon as possible.

Apollo Funds separately enter into a definitive agreement with Snapfish

NEW YORK, June 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Apollo”) (NYSE: APO), a leading global alternative investment manager, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Shutterfly, Inc. (NASDAQ: SFLY) (“Shutterfly” or the “Company”), a leading retailer and manufacturing platform dedicated to helping capture, preserve, and share life’s important moments, for $51.00 per share in cash, or enterprise value of approximately $2.7 billion.

The $51.00 per share cash consideration represents a premium of 31% when compared to Shutterfly’s unaffected closing stock price of $38.91 on April 23, 2019, the last trading day before a media report was published speculating that Apollo Funds were considering a bid for the Company. The Shutterfly Board of Directors unanimously approved the agreement with the Apollo Funds and recommends that Shutterfly stockholders vote in favor of the transaction.

“We are extremely excited for our funds to acquire Shutterfly,” said David Sambur, Senior Partner at Apollo. “At a time when billions of photos are taken every day, Shutterfly has led the charge as a pioneer of personalized photo products and school photography, helping consumers capture, preserve and share life’s most important moments. We look forward to working with Shutterfly’s talented employees and supporting further investments in technology to drive the continued growth and success of the business.”

Shutterfly Transaction Details

The Shutterfly transaction is expected to close by early fourth quarter 2019. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Shutterfly shareholders and receipt of approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The Shutterfly transaction is not conditioned on the closing of the Apollo Funds’ transaction with Snapfish.

Upon completion of the Shutterfly transaction, Shutterfly will become a privately held company, and its shares will no longer be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Snapfish Transaction

Simultaneously, Apollo announced that the Apollo Funds entered into a definitive agreement to combine Snapfish, LLC (“Snapfish”), an internet-based retailer of photography products, with Shutterfly. Upon the closing of the Snapfish transaction, the Snapfish owners will become significant minority owners in the combined Shutterfly and Snapfish business.

The Snapfish transaction is subject to specified closing conditions, including the completion of the Apollo Funds’ acquisition of Shutterfly and receipt of approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The Snapfish transaction is expected to close simultaneously with the Shutterfly acquisition.

Neil Cohen, Chairman of Snapfish and CEO of District Photo, Inc., commented, “We look forward to working with the Apollo Funds. The Apollo Funds bring substantial financial resources as we continue to invest in innovation, as well as valuable strategic perspectives to drive growth over the coming years. We are committed to supporting the company and continuing our relationship as a fulfillment partner.”

“We are thrilled to partner with two pioneers of the photo personalization industry in these innovative transactions,” said David Sambur, Senior Partner at Apollo. “We are confident that this transaction will create an opportunity for innovation and continued growth in the photo and personalized photo products industry. We are excited to work with Neil and the Snapfish team in this transaction, and to benefit from their market expertise after three generations in the photo product business. We believe that both companies will be better positioned to operate in a competitive marketplace through their enhanced ability to invest in product innovation to deliver the best consumer experience.”

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced the dosing of the first Chinese patient in its on-going global pivotal Phase 3 trial of Xynomic’s abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Dr. Jun Guo, Professor and Medical Director at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, is the leading principal investigator for this trial in China.

According to US International Trade Administration, China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, forecasted to grow from $108 billion in 2015 to $167 billion by 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. Total public and private healthcare expenditure reached $640 billion in 2015 and is expected to almost double to $1.1 trillion by 2020.

A global randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway of abexinostat + pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Currently, this trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and South Korea. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of RCC in Q1’2019.

“There are approximately 46,900 new cases of kidney cancer patients in China per year, according to Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Majority of patients develop resistance to pazopanib or other current standard-of-care therapies. Combining abexinostat with pazopanib has shown to reverse drug resistance in a Phase 1b study conducted by University of California, San Francisco and could significantly prolong patients' progression-free-survival time. We are excited to start the China arm of this on-going global trial and look forward to working with Dr. Jun Guo and other leading China kidney cancer specialists.” Mr. Y. Mark Xu, Chairman and CEO of Xynomic, commented.

In addition, Dr. Kapilan Rajagopalan has joined Xynomic as the Medical Monitor for clinical development. Prior to joining Xynomic, from 2016 to 2019 Dr. Rajagopalan worked as a Safety Case Manager and a Safety Operations Physician for Tata Consultancy Services, managing various pharmaceutical projects for Roche and Bayer. From 2014 to 2015, Dr. Rajagopalan was a MD/MBA intern at Humana. From 2012 to 2013, Dr. Rajagopalan was a family medicine resident physician at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. We believe that Dr. Rajagopalan’s experience in performing medical review for oncology pharmaceutical products and his MD education in the USA will enhance Xynomic’s medical monitoring function. Dr. Rajagopalan holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Cincinnati, graduating with Summa Cum Laude honors, a MBA from the University of Louisville with distinction, and a MD degree from the University of Cincinnati.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, announced encouraging interim data from an ongoing Phase 1b study of its lead candidate abexinostat, an orally dosed, hydroxamic acid-based small molecule histone deacetylase (“HDAC”) inhibitor , in combination with Keytruda®, for the treatment of multiple solid tumors. The trial is being conducted at University of California, San Francisco. The interim data will also be presented at the 3rd World-China Immunotherapy & Gene Therapy Congress 2019 to be held in Beijing from August 30th to 31st, 2019.

This Phase 1b trial explores abexinostat in combination with pembrolizumab (trade name Keytruda®) to treat patients with prior progression on Keytruda® or other immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments. A total of 7 patients with prior progression on anti-PD1/PD-L1 treatment were enrolled in the Dose Escalation portion of the study. Tumor types included melanoma (N = 3), urothelial carcinoma (N = 2), neuroendocrine carcinoma (N = 1), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (N = 1). The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 3. Median age of patient population was 61. In the two dose levels tested (abexinostat 30 mg/m2 and 45 mg/m2 on days 1-4, 8-11 in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1), there were no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximally tolerated dose was not reached, and the recommended Phase 2 dose is abexinostat 45 mg/m2 BID on days 1-4, 8-11 of a 21 day cycle in conjunction with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1. There were no treatment-related grade ≥ 3 or serious adverse events. The most common Grade 1-2 adverse events were diarrhea (N = 3), rash (n = 2), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), and dysgeusia (n = 1). 2 out of 7 patients (29%) experienced stable disease for > 6 months. 1 of these 2 patients has pembrolizumab-refractory urothelial carcinoma and remains on treatment for 6+ months with ongoing 20% reduction in tumor size from baseline.

Enrollment in Dose Expansion portion of this trial is ongoing to ascertain the response rate and disease control rate across tumor types. The trial is targeting to enroll a total of approximately 42 patients in the U.S.

“Abexinostat is known mechanistically to have potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We are very pleased with the interim data reported today by UCSF, a world leader in solid tumor clinical research. The data reported today indicate the combination of abexinostat with Keytruda® could be safe and well tolerated and there is preliminary evidence demonstrating efficacy and the potential to reverse resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. We expect to report additional data at a scientific conference early next year.” Mr. Y. Mark Xu, Chairman and CEO of Xynomic commented.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced the dosing of the first Chinese patient in its on-going global pivotal Phase 3 trial of Xynomic’s abexinostat combined with pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Dr. Jun Guo, Professor and Medical Director at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, is the leading principal investigator for this trial in China.

According to US International Trade Administration, China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, forecasted to grow from $108 billion in 2015 to $167 billion by 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. Total public and private healthcare expenditure reached $640 billion in 2015 and is expected to almost double to $1.1 trillion by 2020.

A global randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial is underway of abexinostat + pazopanib as a first- or second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Currently, this trial is being conducted in the United States, Europe and South Korea. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of RCC in Q1’2019.

“There are approximately 46,900 new cases of kidney cancer patients in China per year, according to Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Majority of patients develop resistance to pazopanib or other current standard-of-care therapies. Combining abexinostat with pazopanib has shown to reverse drug resistance in a Phase 1b study conducted by University of California, San Francisco and could significantly prolong patients' progression-free-survival time. We are excited to start the China arm of this on-going global trial and look forward to working with Dr. Jun Guo and other leading China kidney cancer specialists.” Mr. Y.

(“Xynomic”, stock ticker: XYNO), a clinical stage US-China oncology drug development company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast-Track designation to Xynomic’s lead drug candidate abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”). Fast-Track is a designation by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.



According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype in the U.S. with approximately 14,840 new cases per year. It often requires multiple lines of treatment. Despite current available therapies, the outlook for patients that fail third line FL treatment remains poor. The median PFS and EFS were both less than 1 year after third line of treatment. Xynomic is conducting a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of abexinostat, for use as a single agent, as a fourth-line treatment of relapsed or refractory FL in the U.S. and Europe.



FDA has already granted Fast-Track designation to abexinostat, in combination with pazopanib, as a first- or second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.
