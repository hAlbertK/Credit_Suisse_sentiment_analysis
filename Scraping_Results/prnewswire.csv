Receives Nasdaq Notification of Non-Compliance with Listing Rules,"WUHAN CITY, China, July 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Biqi International Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:BIQI) (""Biqi"" or the ""Company""), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, today announced that on July 8, 2019, the Company received notice (the "" Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Notice"") from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") indicating that its Common Shares did not meet the continued listing requirement as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based on the closing bid price of the Common Shares for the preceding 30 business days.

Under Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company received a 180-calendar day grace period from the date of the Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Notice to regain compliance by meeting the continued listing standard of a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day grace period ending on January 6, 2020.

In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), in addition to such initial grace period, the Company could be afforded an additional 180-calendar day compliance period, provided that on the 180th calendar day of the initial grace period, the Company (i) met the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement) and (ii) notified NASDAQ of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency.

Additionally, in a press release issued on May 9, 2019, it was announced that on May 6, 2019 the Company received a letter (the ""Failure to File Notice"") from NASDAQ stating that, because it had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the ""Form 20-F""), it was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Failure to File Notice stated that the Company had until May 20, 2019 to submit to NASDAQ a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In setting the May 20, 2019 deadline for submitting a plan of compliance, the NASDAQ Staff determined to apply more stringent criteria and shorten the normal time period for the Company to submit its plan. The Failure to File Notice stated that if NASDAQ accepted the Company's plan, then NASDAQ could grant the Company up to 180 days from the prescribed due date for filing the Form 20-F to regain compliance.

On May 20, 2019, the Company submitted its plan for compliance for filing the delinquent Form 20-F in which it undertook to file the Form 20-F by July 31, 2019.

On July 10, 2019, the Company received a letter (the ""Delisting Notice"") from NASDAQ advising the Company that its Staff had determined to deny the Company's request for an extension of time to file its Annual Report on Form 20-­F for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to delist the Company's Common Shares for failing to comply with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In addition, the Delisting Notice stated that conflicting public disclosures in the Company's SEC reports had created a lack of clarity regarding the composition of its Board of Directors, as well as its executive management, raising significant concerns regarding the governance of the Company, which the Staff believed constituted a separate and discrete basis for delisting in the exercise of the discretionary authority granted to the Staff by Listing Rule 5101. Listing Rule 5101 states, in part, that NASDAQ ""...has broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities in NASDAQ in order to maintain the quality of and public confidence in its market, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. NASDAQ may use such discretion to deny initial listing, apply additional or more stringent criteria for the initial or continued listing of particular securities, or suspend or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs that makes initial or continued listing of the securities on NASDAQ inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of NASDAQ, even though the securities meet all enumerated criteria for initial or continued listing on NASDAQ.""

The Notice stated that unless the Company requested an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist its Common Shares, trading of the Common Shares will be suspended at the opening of business on July 19, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Company intends to request a hearing with a Hearings Panel at NASDAQ to appeal the delisting determination and to request a stay of the trading suspension pending the outcome of the hearing. In addition, the Company will submit a plan of compliance to regain compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing of the Company's Common Shares with its request for a hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with such requirements.

The Delisting Determination stated that unless the Company requests an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist the Company's ADSs, trading of the ADSs will be suspended at the opening of business on September 17, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on the Nasdaq. After due deliberation, the Company does not intend to appeal the Delisting Determination by requesting a hearing before a hearings panel. After the Company is delisted from the Nasdaq, its ADSs may be traded over-the-counter on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the ""pink sheets"" if one or more market makers seeks and obtains approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to continue quoting in the Company's ADSs. Many over-the-counter stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the Nasdaq, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of the Company's ADSs.

This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a Staff delisting determination.

In the event the Company does not regain compliance with the Rule within 180 calendar days, the Company may be eligible for additional time.

The notification has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ADSs between now and December 9, 2019 and intends to consider available options to cure the deficiency and regain compliance with the Rule's minimum bid price requirement within the prescribed grace period. The Company's ADSs will continue to be listed and trade on the Nasdaq Global Market during this period, unaffected by the receipt of the written notification from Nasdaq.

This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a deficiency notification.

This research evaluates key technologies involved in digital transformation including 5G, AI, Big Data Analytics, Blockchain, Cloud and Mobile Edge Computing, Connected and Wearable Devices, Cybersecurity, Digital Twins and Teleoperation, IoT, Robotics, Smart Cities, and Virtual Reality solutions.

These technologies will all be germane to the evolution of many areas important to enterprise and industrial organizations including internal and external processes, products and services, virtualization, OSS/BSS, and more.

The enterprise and industrial sectors are rapidly digitizing their products and services including software-controlled and virtualized infrastructure as well as leveraging next-generation connectivity, signaling, and automated decision-making algorithms. This will have a profound effect on both overall strategic positioning and day to day tactical operations. New technologies and tools being rapidly integrated into production and service systems, which are facilitating the transformation of processes, creating new business opportunities, and enabling an overall smarter workplace for humans and machines alike.



Telecom infrastructure and services providers are also undergoing a massive transformation. For example, the combination of 5G and edge computing will transform wireless carrier operations and facilitate enhanced services, new applications, and completely new business models for mobile network operators. In addition, software-defined control and infrastructure virtualization are poised to transform network and service architecture thanks to improvements in technologies that offer improved performance and lower costs. As the border between cloud computing and network infrastructure continues to blur, so does the demarcation between the network as a whole and those network elements (servers, terminals, etc.) that comprise the network.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms enhance the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The combination of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to dramatically accelerate the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The author sees the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) as transformational for both technologies as AI adds value to IoT through machine learning and decision making and IoT adds value to AI through connectivity and data exchange.



AIoT solutions dramatically accelerating the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective smart city solutions in terms of decision making. 5G provides substantial bandwidth where needed as well as significantly lower latency for next-generation applications and services such as virtual reality controlled teleoperation and other enhanced user interfaces.



We see smart cities providing significant opportunities for technology integration in support of highly customized, yet scalable services. There will be a positive feedback loop created and sustained by leveraging the interdependent capabilities of AI, IoT, and 5G (AIoT5G). For example, AI will work in conjunction with IoT to substantially improve smart city supply chains. Metropolitan area supply chains represent complex systems of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer.



The Industrial IoT (IIoT) market is much more than the sum of its parts, but its parts alone can be daunting, especially considering how emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and modified reality is being rapidly integrated into industrial processes. AI alone is anticipated to dramatically reduce costs and improve processes as well as facilitate completely new products and services that improve production, quality, and the producer-supplier relationship.



This is the most comprehensive research available anywhere that evaluates each of these technologies and assesses their convergence and integration opportunities. The research provides a wide-ranging view into the ecosystem including companies, strategies, and solutions for each technical domain as well as cross-domain implementation and operations. The research provides detailed forecasts by application and service, use case, and industry vertical.

Market leading companies are rapidly integrated big data technologies with IoT infrastructure

The big data market consists of infrastructure providers, data centers, data as a service providers, and other vendors. Solutions for managing unstructured data are evolving beyond systems aligned towards primarily human-generated data (such as social networking, messaging, and browsing habits) towards increasingly greater emphasis upon machine-generated data found across many industry verticals.



For example, manufacturing and healthcare are anticipated to create massive amounts of data that may be rendered useful only through advanced analytics and various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as machine learning and cognitive computing. The long-term prospect for these technologies is that they will become embedded in many different other technologies and provide autonomous decision making on behalf of humans, both directly, and indirectly through many processes, products, and services.



Emerging networks and systems such as IoT and edge computing will generate substantial amounts of unstructured data, which will present both technical challenges and market opportunities for operating companies and their vendors. Emerging big data tools such as open APIs much be implemented to facilitate data capture and processing with the ability to perform localized processing and decision making.



Big data solution provider dynamics are evolving almost as much as the data management technologies themselves. While some companies rely upon proprietary solutions, many leading companies such as Hortonworks and Cloudera offer products and services primarily based on open source Apache Hadoop technology. One important distinction between market leaders is collaboration vs. competition. For example, Cloudera competes with IBM, Microsoft, and others in data science and AI whereas Hortonworks partners with these companies.



In terms of data management and analytics technologies, the big data industry is experiencing profound changes across the entire stack including infrastructure, security, analytics, and the application layer. The data services industry as a whole is shifting from host-based network topologies to cloud-based, data-centric architectures, thereby creating enormous challenges and opportunities for transitioning and securing data systems. In concert with this shift, big data infrastructure will require strategic governance and framework for optimized security.



Advanced analytics provide the ability to make raw data meaningful and useful as information for decision-making purposes. AI enhances the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective decision making, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks.



The ability to capture streaming data, determine valuable attributes, and make decisions in real-time will add an entirely new dimension to service logic. In many cases, the data itself, and actionable information will be the service. However, real-time data is anticipated to become a highly valuable aspect of all solutions as a determinant of user behavior, application effectiveness, and an identifier of new and enhanced mobile/wireless and/or IoT related apps and services.



Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) are perhaps best known as data-intensive immersive technologies that require high bandwidth for operations. One of the least evaluated opportunities is the market opportunities associated with visualizing data and information in AR, VR, and MR environments. Much of this data will be unstructured, requiring big data analytics tools to process, categorize, and display in a meaningful manner. This will allow the end user to visualize and utilize information in ways previously inconceivable.



In addition, leading data management companies are developing tools for improved general data visualization, facilitating improved information interpretation and decision making. Coupled with AI and cognitive computing, the field of advanced data visualization and analytics known as augmented analytics is transforming otherwise useless data into highly valuable and actionable smart data, often enabling dynamic decision making that may positively impact business operations as processes, transactions, and other events occur. Much of this smart data will be monetized in a data as a service approach by enterprise thanks to leading big data service provider solutions.

This report also includes analysis and forecasts for streaming data analytics. IoT facilitates vast amounts of fast-moving data from sensors and devices. For many use cases, data flows constantly from the device or sensor to the network and sometimes back to the device. In some cases, these streams of data are simply stored (for potential later use) and in other cases, there is a need for real-time data processing and analytics.

As a result, Emmaus common stock and warrants will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market at the start of trading on Wednesday, September 11, 2019. It is expected that the company's common stock and warrants will be eligible for quotation on the OTC market after that date.

In its letter to Emmaus, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel recognized that the company is doing important work and expressed its hope that Emmaus securities may again trade on Nasdaq once the company meets Nasdaq's initial listing standards. Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications. We will continue to focus on our mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies.""

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

Operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was reduced to $1.2 million, versus $7.2 million last year.

As previously disclosed, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI were converted into shares of EMI common stock and cancelled in the merger in exchange for Emmaus shares, with a resulting increase in stockholders' equity. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock at a current conversion price of $9.52, subject to possible future adjustments.

Recent Highlights



Received clearance on its investigational new drug application from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the study of a new L-glutamine treatment for patients suffering from diverticulosis. EMI commenced a pilot/phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of its treatment at multiple study sites, with patents approved in the United States , the EU, China , Russia , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Australia and Indonesia . Emmaus has patents pending related to diverticulosis treatment in Brazil and India .

Signed an agreement with Express Scripts, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBM), and launched a commercial co-payment assistance program to help ensure that patients in need have access to Endari.

Entered into an exclusive agreement with taiba Healthcare for the registration, commercialization and distribution of Endari in certain countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

As previously reported, on July 17, 2019, Emmaus, formerly known as ""MYnd Analytics, Inc.,"" completed its merger transaction with EMI, whereby EMI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emmaus and the business of Emmaus became that of EMI. On July 18, 2019, Emmaus common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMA.""

Since the merger transaction occurred subsequent to the 2019 second quarter, Emmaus' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflects the historical business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and operations and financial results of the former MYnd Analytics which were spun off in conjunction with and prior to the merger. As a result, those results bear no relation to the company's current business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations. EMI's historical financial statements, along with pro forma financial information for Emmaus which give effect to the spin off and the merger, can be found in the exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A to be filed on August 14, 2019 which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.

Nasdaq Listing Status Update

Emmaus is currently reviewing a number of options related to maintaining the listing of its common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The company has appealed the initial decision of the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. The appeal is scheduled to be heard on September 5, 2019. In the event the appeal is unsuccessful, Emmaus common stock may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Market.

Taps SB360 As Exclusive Consultant To Conduct Store Closing Sales In The Last Remaining 81 Fred's Stores,"BOSTON, Sept. 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fred's Inc., a discount value retailer, has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners as their exclusive consultant to conduct Store Closing Sales in all 81 remaining Fred's locations. SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

SB360 was initially retained by Fred's in April to conduct Store Closing Sales in 159 locations. Those stores have entered their final days and will wrap up business over the next week to 10 days.

SB360 planned well for the initial round of closings. ""We predicted Fred's customers would be filling up their carts from day one, and we were correct,"" said Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Word spreads quickly in the many smaller communities Fred's serves. When shoppers come into a store and see the liquidation discounts off Fred's everyday value prices, they buy in bulk.""

Mr. Miller and Mr. Schaffer concurred. ""These Sales won't last long. Quantities are limited and the first few days will put a significant dent in inventory levels. We encourage shoppers to come in early for the best selection.""

Stores,"BOSTON, June 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- In an ongoing effort to rationalize their store footprint, Fred's Inc., has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, as the exclusive consultant to conduct ""Store Closing"" Sales in 49 additional stores. The Sale in these additional stores starts today.

Fred's Pharmacies within each of the locations will be unaffected by the closures. The Fred's Pharmacy team will continue to serve all of their customer's prescription needs.

Since early April, SB360 has worked with Fred's management, market leaders, and store teams to conduct Store Closing Sales. One group of 105 Fred's stores will wrap up sales and close for business over the next week.

Founded in 1947, Fred's serves small communities throughout the southeast.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""As we saw in the prior Fred's closing stores, sales are always brisk, and the shelves empty quickly. Fred's stores offer good day-in, day-out value on everyday necessities, and with discounts on top of good prices, shoppers buy in bulk.""

""Fred's shoppers are frequent shoppers,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""They're in the store every week, and some of them are in multiple times each week. When they see the discounts, word travels fast. Fred's shoppers know if they don't buy early, what they want may not be there later.""

Fred's store teams work hard to keep the shelves stocked. But after a few days of the Closing Sale, the backrooms are empty and the stores start condensing the remaining product.

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller emphasized, ""The best advice we can give is to shop the Fred's stores early in the Sale for best selection.""

and in Paoli Peaks in Indiana

""We are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to add such a powerful network of ski areas to our Company,"" said Rob Katz, chairman and chief executive officer of Vail Resorts. ""Peak Resorts' ski areas in the Northeast are a perfect complement to our existing resorts and together will provide a very compelling offering to our guests in New York and Boston. With this acquisition, we are also able to make a much stronger connection to guests in critical cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest and build on the success we have already seen with our strategy in Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit. The acquisition fully embodies our philosophy of Epic for Everyone, making skiing and riding more accessible to guests across the U.S. and around the world.""

""The ski areas within the Peak Resorts portfolio exemplify the spirit of our sport as well as our Company's mission to provide an Experience of a Lifetime to guests,"" Katz continued. ""We're thrilled to welcome the resorts and their employees into the Vail Resorts family and invest in their continued success.""

The aggregate purchase price for all Peak Resorts common stock is estimated to be approximately $264 million (calculated on a treasury method basis), which Vail Resorts intends to finance through a combination of cash on hand, its existing revolver facility and an expansion of its existing credit facility. In addition, Vail Resorts will be assuming or refinancing Peak Resorts' outstanding debt.

The acquisition is expected to generate incremental annual EBITDA of approximately $60 million in Vail Resorts' fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, the first fiscal year with the full benefit of the synergies of the acquisition, with additional revenue upside in future years. Synergies are expected to come from additional revenue across the Vail Resorts network of resorts and cost reductions from the elimination of certain duplicative administrative functions and greater efficiencies brought by Vail Resorts' size and scale. Vail Resorts' annual ongoing capital expenditures are expected to increase by $10 million to support the addition of the Peak Resorts ski areas. After closing of the transaction, Vail Resorts plans to invest approximately $15 million over the next two years in one-time capital spending to elevate the guest experience at these resorts.

The transaction was approved by both companies' Boards of Directors, and the Peak Resorts Board of Directors also recommends that Peak Resorts' shareholders approve the transaction.

The transaction is expected to close this fall. The parties expect operations at all Peak Resorts ski areas to continue in the ordinary course of business. Upon closing, Vail Resorts plans to retain the vast majority of each resort's employees.

WeissLaw is investigating whether SKIS' Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the merger agreement. Notably, the Company recently announced record-breaking financial results. It reported revenue of $184.42 million for the year ended April 30, 2019, representing an increase of $52.76 million over the $131.66 million reported in the same period of the previous year. According to SKIS' President and CEO, ""[f]iscal 2019 was a record year for [SKIS] . . . Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%.""

Given these facts, WeissLaw is concentrating its investigation on whether the merger enhances SKIS' shareholder value. Specifically, WeissLaw is concerned whether SKIS' Board conducted a fair process in agreeing to the proposed merger, whether the proposed merger undervalues the Company, and whether all material information related to the proposed merger is fully and fairly disclosed.

(NASDAQ: TBRG) (""Thunder Bridge""), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Thunder Bridge will acquire REPAY and the combined company (the ""Company"") will continue as a publicly-listed company with an implied enterprise value at closing of approximately $653 million, based on current assumptions.

Upon the close of the transaction, the Company intends to change its name to Repay Holdings Corporation and is expected to continue to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market under a new ticker symbol. REPAY's management team, led by John Morris, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Shaler Alias, Co-Founder and President, and Tim Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, will continue to lead the Company. REPAY's existing majority equity holder, Corsair Capital, a leading private equity investor in the financial services industry, is expected to remain the Company's largest stockholder.

REPAY processed approximately $7 billion of payment volume in 2018 across diverse verticals, such as personal loans, automotive loans and receivables management. Management believes these verticals are underserved and accordingly provide significant growth opportunities over the next several years. The Company serves more than 3,000 clients via a proprietary, omni-channel payment platform that reduces complexity for merchants and enhances the consumer experience. In addition to highly-recurring revenue, REPAY has achieved strong Adjusted EBITDA growth over the last three years through market expansion, increased penetration of existing customers, new client wins and strategic acquisitions.

Gary Simanson, President and CEO of Thunder Bridge, said, ""REPAY has achieved impressive growth while also delivering high levels of profitability in an exciting and underpenetrated area of the payments sector. John Morris and his team have developed a technology platform that is well-positioned with over 50 software integration partnerships to service customers with a footprint representing more than 11,000 locations across the country. We are looking forward to partnering with REPAY's management team and Corsair in the next stage of the Company's development.""

""We are very excited to continue to execute on REPAY's growth plan as a public company and greatly appreciate Corsair's continued involvement and partnership,"" said John Morris, co-founder and CEO of REPAY. ""We have developed a compelling tech-enabled value proposition that allows our merchants to expand the scope and depth of their services to meet the evolving needs of their customers. As a publicly-listed company, we will have access to capital to further support our acquisition strategy and invest in technology while continuing to develop software integration partners. We remain focused on delivering the highest levels of service to our merchants as we strengthen our leading position in the industry.""

James Kirk, Managing Director of Corsair Capital, commented, ""We are proud of all REPAY has achieved since Corsair's investment in 2016, and we look forward to continuing to support the Company's development of value-added payment solutions. With over $500 billion of total payment volume, including over $200 billion of debit payment volume, projected next year across REPAY's existing verticals and the ongoing evaluation of a pipeline of potential acquisition targets, we believe there are significant growth opportunities for the business in the future.""

""The payments industry is one of the most dynamic segments of the financial services space, and REPAY has established itself as an integrated player and early-mover in an important and underserved sector of the market,"" added Jeremy Schein, Managing Director of Corsair Capital. ""Given REPAY's growth and history of pioneering innovative payment solutions, we see compelling opportunities ahead and look forward to our continued partnership with the REPAY management team.""

Transaction Summary

The transaction reflects an implied enterprise value at closing of $653 million, based on current assumptions. The cash component of the purchase price to be paid to the equity holders of REPAY is expected to be funded by Thunder Bridge's cash in trust and debt financing, for which a commitment has been obtained. The balance of the consideration payable to the existing REPAY equity holders will consist of equity interests of the surviving subsidiary which will be exchangeable into shares of common stock of the Company at the option of such equity holders. Existing REPAY equity holders have the potential to receive an earnout of additional equity interests of the surviving subsidiary if certain stock price targets are met as set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Corsair Capital and the REPAY management team will remain investors by rolling over significant equity into the combined company.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Thunder Bridge will domesticate from a Cayman Islands exempted company to a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge will merge with and into Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC, with Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge. The corporate name of Thunder Bridge will change to Repay Holdings Corporation.

The transactions have been unanimously approved by the boards of both REPAY and Thunder Bridge. Completion of the transactions is subject to approval by the stockholders of Thunder Bridge and certain other conditions. The transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.

Additional information about the business combination will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will contain an investor presentation to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and available at www.sec.gov. In addition, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC.

Advisors

Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, and CLSA acted as capital markets advisors and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP acted as legal counsel to Thunder Bridge. Financial Technology Partners served as strategic and financial advisor, Credit Suisse as capital markets advisor, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Troutman Sanders as legal counsel to REPAY in this transaction.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This communication contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as ""will likely result,"" ""are expected to,"" ""will continue,"" ""is anticipated,"" ""estimated,"" ""believe,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""projection,"" ""outlook"" or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding REPAY's industry and market sizes, future opportunities for REPAY and the Company, REPAY's estimated future results and the proposed business combination between Thunder Bridge and REPAY, including the implied enterprise value, the expected transaction and ownership structure and the likelihood and ability of the parties to successfully consummate the proposed transaction. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

In addition to factors previously disclosed in Thunder Bridge's reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: inability to meet the closing conditions to the business combination, including the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of Thunder Bridge's shareholders, the inability to consummate the contemplated debt financing, the failure to achieve the minimum amount of cash available following any redemptions by Thunder Bridge shareholders or the failure to meet The Nasdaq Stock Market's listing standards in connection with the consummation of the contemplated transactions; costs related to the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement; a delay or failure to realize the expected benefits from the proposed transaction; risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; changes in the payment processing market in which REPAY competes, including with respect to its competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory changes; changes in the vertical markets that REPAY targets; risks relating to REPAY's relationships within the payment ecosystem; risk that REPAY may not be able to execute its growth strategies, including identifying and executing acquisitions; risks relating to data security; and risk that REPAY may not be able to develop and maintain effective internal controls.

Actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. All information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof in the case of information about Thunder Bridge and REPAY or the date of such information in the case of information from persons other than Thunder Bridge or REPAY, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this communication. Forecasts and estimates regarding REPAY's industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT

For additional information on the proposed transaction, see Thunder Bridge's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed concurrently. In connection with the proposed transaction, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. Before making any voting or investment decision, investors and stockholders of Thunder Bridge are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus, when they become available, and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. The documents filed by Thunder Bridge with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, or by directing a request to Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd., 9912 Georgetown Pike, Suite D203, Great Falls, Virginia 22066, Attention: Secretary, (202) 431-0507

PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION

Thunder Bridge and REPAY and certain of their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in favor of the approval of the business combination. Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed participants in the solicitation of the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in connection with the proposed business combination will be set forth in the registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a proxy statement/prospectus, when it becomes available. Information regarding Thunder Bridge's directors and executive officers are set forth in Thunder Bridge's Registration Statement on Form S-1, including amendments thereto, and other reports which are filed with the SEC. Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REPAY uses certain non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its business, measure its performance and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income prior to interest expense and depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to add back certain non-cash charges and account for non-recurring items, such as other expenses, non-cash gain from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction expenses, share-based compensation charges, and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP but instead considered alongside such measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in the industry may calculate it differently from how REPAY calculates it, reducing its overall usefulness. This communication does not provide a reconciliation of any forward-looking, estimated non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because calculating the components would involve numerous estimates and judgments that are unduly burdensome to prepare and may imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or potentially misleading to investors.

Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited  | YRIV,PRNewswire,https://news.google.com./articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3lhbmd0emUtcml2ZXItcG9ydC1hbmQtbG9naXN0aWNzLWxpbWl0ZWQteXJpdnMtcHJvY2VlZGluZ3MtYW5kLWxpdGlnYXRpb24tcHJvZ3Jlc3MtYWdhaW5zdC1oaW5kZW5idXJnLXJlc2VhcmNoLTMwMDkwODYzMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2019-08-28T07:00:00Z,2019-10-07-13-57,Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (YRIV)'s Proceedings and Litigation Progress against Hindenburg Research,"NEW YORK, Aug. 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- On January 23, 2019, Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (Nasdaq: YRIV) (the ""Company"") filed a defamation lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court, New York County, against Hindenburg Research, Nathan Anderson, ClaritySpring Securities LLC and ClaritySpring Inc. (collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain.

""We feel as a company the best way to fight the short and distort strategy of our accuser is to operate and litigate. Our assets have been acquired and developed with real cash payments; and, the long term investment opportunity for profit leveraging our assets will ring true for our investors. This is a long and calculated battle with these short sellers, and we intend to fight with all of our capabilities using every resource available to us. We have a bright future as a member of the global economy and we look forward to the first steps on a long journey,"" said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

The impetus for the action was a false, misleading and defamatory unsigned article published on December 6, 2018 through one of the Defendants' aliases, ""Hindenburg Research,"" which erroneously accused Yangtze of making fraudulent misrepresentations in its public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") or intentionally omitting material information in those filings, laundering money through sham transactions for the benefit of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and being ensnared in a catastrophic liquidity crisis rendering the Company worthless.

As the Company's Complaint establishes with supporting evidence that was publicly filed with the SEC, the statements made in the Defendants' report are not only demonstrably false and misleading, but also nothing more than a ""short and distort"" attack on the Company for the financial gain of those Defendants, who concede in the Report that they ""are short YRIV"".

In the meantime, the Company has suffered a disastrous fallout from Defendants' coordinated attack, resulting in, among other things, reputational damage per se and monetary damages, which the Company seeks to redress through its lawsuit. The Company is confident that through this lawsuit, it will achieve the necessary legal recourse to compensate it for Defendants' wrongful actions and rehabilitate its reputation, enabling the Company to, once again, develop and continue to grow financially for the benefit of its shareholders.

Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited  | YRIV,PRNewswire,https://news.google.com./articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3lhbmd0emUtcml2ZXItcG9ydC1hbmQtbG9naXN0aWNzLWxpbWl0ZWQteXJpdi1wcm92aWRlcy10aGUtYWNjdXJhdGUtZGV0YWlscy1yZWdhcmRpbmctaGluZGVuYnVyZ3MtcmVzZWFyY2gtcmVwb3J0LTMwMDc2NDY4NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2018-12-12T08:00:00Z,2019-10-07-13-57,Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited (YRIV) Provides the Accurate Details Regarding Hindenburg's Research Report,"""The unconstructed part of the project is a planned ""Logistics Center"" that YRIV states it will build on 1.2 million square meters of land leased from a local village. On YRIV's latest quarterly balance sheet, the rights to the land are reported as having a value of $299 million, comprising over 77% of the company's total assets… Despite claiming to lease 1.2 million square meters from the village, our government-sourced maps…show that the total area of the village is only 610 thousand square meters. Moreover, conversations with officials from the village in question revealed that contrary to the company's claims, YRIV has not leased any land from them.""

The value of $299 million reflected in the Company's latest quarterly balance sheet is not related to the 1.2 million square meters of land. Instead, the reported value of $299 million relates to the value of land use rights of the unused portion of 6 parcels of commercial land (steel logistics park). Originally, the value of these land use rights of the 6 parcels of commercial land totaling 515,600 square meters, was booked at a cost of $308 million , of which 79,200 square meters of land have been used for constructing commercial buildings with 92,700 square meters of floor area, leaving 436,400 square meters of unused land. It is this unused piece of land that we have reported a value of $299 million . As of today, due to the significant appreciation of the local real estate market, we estimate that the 515,600 square meters of land that the Company has obtained land use right certificates for and was accounted at cost value, has nearly doubled to a value of nearly $600 million .

The Company's lease of 1.2 million square meters of land mentioned in the Report comprises land not only from the Chunfeng Village but also Junmin Village and Jiangdi Village, which were brokered and represented through Chunfeng Village.

2. Undisclosed Legal Judgments

A list of the 11 undisclosed legal judgments mentioned in the Report is set forth below:

Items 1-6 relate to the litigation and judgements arising from the sale of commercial house flats by the Company's subsidiary, Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd. (""Wuhan Newport""). These commercial house flats were sold in or before 2015. According to the relevant contracts of sale, if Wuhan Newport fails to develop the area in accordance with its original development plan within one year after the sale and purchase, Wuhan Newport would have to repurchase the commercial house flats at the original contracted price back from the purchasers. These proceedings were instituted by the purchasers before the said properties appreciated and doubled in value between 2017 and 2018. Consequently, the purchasers are now reluctant to enforce the judgments and sell back the properties to Wuhan Newport. The Company has already made provisions for the purchase of the properties in the financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Because the judgments were already rendered, the Company has not disclosed these judgements as ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Item 7 refers to the loan of RMB 290 million due to China Construction Bank Gangcheng Branch dated May 28, 2014 mentioned in the Report, plus interest totaling approximately RMB 325 million , and not in addition to such loan. The loan and interest payable obligations have been disclosed and accounted for in the Company's financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2017 .

10. LOANS PAYABLE

The Company is in the process of negotiating a loan restructure with the bank and in the meantime, all payments due are suspended. Also, as a result of negotiations, the bank has not instituted enforcement proceedings. As in the above Items 1-6, because a judgement has already been rendered, the Company has not disclosed it as an ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Items 8-11 refer to judgements obtained against Wuhan Newport as a guarantor for certain loans taken out by a large shareholder of Wuhan Newport before it became a subsidiary of the Company. Since the judgments were rendered, the shareholder has undertaken in writing to be solely responsible for all these loans without recourse to Wuhan Newport and has entered into a repayment plan with his creditor(s). Accordingly, no enforcement actions have been instituted against Wuhan Newport and in accordance with legal opinion from PRC counsel, there are no legal or financial liability accorded to Wuhan Newport.

3. Money from YRIV's Capital Raises Has Been Used to Pay the Chairman/Controlling Shareholder Rather Than Advance Company's Projects

The Report alleges that the Company has consistently reported large liability balances ""due to related parties"" on its financial statements. These, in turn, seem to accrue large interest rates which simply get added to the ""advances"" over time. When capital is raised, cash is then used to pay back the supposed related-party ""advances"", rather than being employed to further the company's projects.

Ever since the closing of the reverse merger in December 2015 , the Company has taken out 19 short-term loans via convertible notes totaling $8.546 million . The money from these loans was mainly used for paying the proposed upfront deposit payments for acquiring another entity, Wuhan Economic Development Port Limited (""Wuhan Port EDP""). Because the acquisition of Wuhan Port EDP as aborted, the Company began repaying the convertible notes from the loan proceeds. As of the end of November 2018 , the Company has repaid $9.031 million ( $7.846 million in principal plus $1.184 million in interest), leaving an unpaid principal of $699,000 .

Contrary to the Report, the Company's CEO, Mr. Xiangyao Liu has not only not received a penny from these loans but has advanced as much as $485,000 towards the payment of the $9.031 million by the Company and will likewise advance the forthcoming redemption of an unexpired principal of $699,000 plus interest.

Hindenburg quoted the following from the Company's Quarter Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 :

The Report concluded that there was a total repayment of ""loans"" of approximately $6.2 million to Mr. Liu. This is not the case. The Report focused on the numbers highlighted in the red circles but neglected the increased amounts highlighted in the green circles which showed increased advances from Mr. Liu to the Company. The net effect of the aforementioned numbers shows a net advance from Mr. Liu to the Company. In addition, as mentioned in the Report, ""the total amount of those 19 convertible notes amounted to $8.5 million, of which $3.39 million is outstanding while $5.15 million has been redeemed."" As such, there is no way that Mr. Liu would have received $6.2 million from the proceeds of the notes.

""The Report contains numerous errors of facts and misleading speculations that are libelous and we categorically deny such speculations. This Report is largely a rehash of prior allegations made against us and only focuses on certain discrete information to cultivate a distorted view of the Company"", said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ""We have not granted access to Hindenburg nor has Hindenberg ever contacted us to seek any clarification or explanation to the allegations made. These speculations have caused significant damage to our Company and we are resolved to take such actions necessary to defend ourselves and protect the interests of our shareholders. Additionally, we have instructed counsel to explore our recourse against Hindenburg for making such irresponsible, baseless and libelous statements, including but not limited to instituting legal proceedings against them. We are committed to a high level of corporate governance and stand by the integrity of our financial statements and business operations. We will be conducting a special internal investigation into the other allegations made and will report the outcome of such investigation in due course.""

Full Year 2018 Financial Results

Interest and fee income

For the year of 2018, total interest and fee income, which include interest and fees on its direct lending loans, management and assessment service fees and interest on deposits with banks, was $0.26 million, compared to $16.53 million for the prior year. The significant decrease in loans issued was caused by a combined effect of business slow-down of the direct lending loans in Xinjiang area as a result of management assessment of economic environment in supply chain financing in Urumqi and increasing past due loan receivable and interest receivable which resulted in reversal of interest income. since the second half of 2017.

Interest expenses

The Company used borrowed funds, including short-term bank loans, secured loan and loans from third parties, to fund its direct lending business. Total interest expenses decreased by $0.47 million, or 6.4%, to $6.90 million for the year of 2018 from $ 7.37 million for the prior year mainly due to interest penalty from overdue loans. The loans with the amount of $154.41 million were overdue.

Provision for loan losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance ASU 2016-13 for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, which is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information and will likely result in earlier recognition of credit reserves.

CECL adoption will have broad impact on the financial statements of financial services firms, which will affect key profitability and solvency measures. Some of the more notable expected changes include:

Higher loan loss reserve levels and related deferred tax assets. While different asset types will be impacted differently, the expectation is that reserve levels will generally increase across the board for all financial firms.

Increased reserve levels may lead to a reduction in capital levels.

As a result of higher reserving levels, the expectation is that CECL will reduce cyclicality in financial firms' results, as higher reserving in ""good times"" will mean that less dramatic reserve increases will be loan related income (which will continue to be recognized on a periodic basis based on the effective interest method) and the related credit losses (which will be recognized up front at origination). This will make periods of loan expansion seem less profitable due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Periods of stable or declining loan levels will look comparatively profitable as the income trickles in for loans, where losses had been previously recognized.

Provision for loan losses increased by $30.42 million, or 55%, to $85.72 million for the year of 2018 from $55.30 million for the prior year. The increase was mainly related to more loans past due over 180 days as compared to that during the year ended December 31, 2017 as certain customers were facing financial difficulties since the second half of 2017 that caused increased provision rate charged for loan losses for the year 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management continued to assess the adequacy of the allowances in a cautious manner. Management assessed the collectability of loan receivable balances on an individual basis and concluded the collection from certain borrowers is remote .

At the end of each period, we conduct an aging analysis of each customer's arrears to determine whether the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. In establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider historical experience, the economic environment, trends in the construction industry, expected collectability of amounts receivable that are past due, and the expected collectability of overdue receivables. An estimate of doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. As a result, total allowance of $128.93 million was recorded for the year of 2018, compared to $64.29 million for the prior year. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had 75 and 59 business loan customers, and 159 and 174 personal loan customers, respectively. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

Financial Condition and Going Concern

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.31 million, compared to $1.22 million as of December 31, 2017. Net loans receivable was $92.58 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $117.26 million at the end of 2017. Short-term bank loans, loans from a cost method investee, loans from third parties and secured loan were $7.98 million, $14.54 million, $3.31 million and $79.21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to $11.97 million, $15.37 million, $nil and $15.34 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.

Most of our customers are MSMEs and individual proprietors located in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province and Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Our customers are involved in the commerce and service, energy and mining, real estate, agriculture and husbandry, supply chain financing, construction and decoration, manufacturing, consumer credit and other industries. In particular, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, loans to the tire supply chain financing industry accounts for 35.9% and 46.5% of total amounts of loans originated by the Company, loans to commerce and service industry accounts for 24.9% and 39.8% of total amount of loans, and loans to construction and decoration industry accounts for 23.0% and nil of total amount of loans. The capital liquidity of the Company was also influenced consequently due to a decrease in cash inflows provided by operating activities. The company's operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and if the Company will be able to maintain profitability and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and /or manage operating expense in line with revenue forecasts, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability.

The Company's accounts have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern basis. The following includes conditions give rise to substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date and management's plans to mitigate these adverse conditions:

The Company had an accumulated deficit of $136.62 million, negative net asset of $36 million and total liabilities of $122.02 million as of December 31, 2018. Assessing that the Company was not able to keep the size of lending business within one year from the financial statement issuance date, the Company established Zhiyuan and Zeshi in November 2018, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, including business factoring program, financing products design, related corporate financing solutions, investments and asset management, etc. as part of its restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2018, Zhiyuan disbursed loans of aggregating $64.7 million to four customers.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred operating loss of $94.13 million. Affected by the reduction of lending business and increased loans losses, the management was in the opinion that recurring operating losses would be made continue within one year from the financial statement issuance date. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred negative operating cash flow of $2.20 million. However with the establishment of Zhiyuan and Zeshi, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, the management assessed the Company would have a positive operating cash flow within one year from the financial statement issuance date.

The Company has been actively seeking for strategic investors with experience in lending business as well as financial investors. On July 10, 2018, the Company closed a registered direct offering pursuant to a previously announced securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, raising approximately $1.69 million, net of issuance costs, from selling its ordinary shares at a price of $2.60 per share. The Company plans to continue to seek fund resources as well as strategic investors for additional financing.

Though management had plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statements issuance date, as there is no assurance that the liquidity plan will be successfully implemented. Failure to successfully implement the plan will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial position, and will materially adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern.

On January 16, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from Xinjiang superior people's court. China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd. sued the Company and its guarantors for a default on the loan, plus penalties. On September 18, 2018, Xinjiang Superior People's Court adjudicated that the Company shall repay the principal, interest and penalties owed to China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd, aggregating US$16.4 million. The Company is now in the process of appeal and is actively negotiating with China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd about the debt restructuring, but there is no agreement achieved as of the date of the announcement.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company was involved in five lawsuits with its loan customers for the aggregated claim of delinquent balances of $2.95 million, and in which the Company is a defendant. The amount which the Company is being sued for delinquent balances owned to two third parties is approximately $4.64 million.

Recent Updates

In April 2019, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the disposition of Xinjiang Xin Quan Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (""Xin Quan""). As of the date of disposition, Xin Quan was not engaged in any operations, nor had any net assets.

On February 4, 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a framework agreement to acquire up to 80.46% of equity interest in Zhejiang Lixin Enterprise Management Holding Co., Ltd.

Pursuant to such framework agreement, the Company will acquire the equity interest in Lixin from six selling shareholders of Lixin by issuing new shares and/or using cash on hand. The proposed transaction is expected to be consummated through multiple closings with the first closing by June 30, 2019, subject to further review and approval of the Company's Board of Directors and/or shareholders, if needed, as well as other customary closing conditions. There is no guarantee that the transaction contemplated under the framework agreement will be consummated as planned or at all. The Company expects that the acquisition of equity interests in Lixin, if consummated, has the potential of transforming the Company into a profitable and well diversified financial services company with geographical outreach well beyond the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Company also announced that its business factoring services business, which the Company launched in late November through its recently incorporated subsidiary, Zhiyuan Factoring (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd.

On August 6, 2018, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Xin Quan that engages in the business of financial leasing, increased its registered capital from US$30.0 million to US$50.0 million. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company, through China Fenghui Financial Holdings Group, holds a 60% interest in Xin Quan and Xinjiang Heli Kaiyuan Construction Co., Ltd. (""Heli Kaiyuan"") holds a 40% interest in Xin Quan.

On July 6, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two institutional investors for a registered direct placement of approximately $2.0 million gross proceeds from selling its ordinary shares at a price of $2.60 per share. The Company issued a total of 769,232 ordinary shares to institutional investors. As part of the transaction, the Company issued to the investors Series A warrants to purchase up to 576,924 ordinary shares at an exercise price of $2.60 per share, which warrants have a term of four (4) years from the date of issuance. The investors also received Series B warrants with an initial face amount of 200,000 ordinary shares, which are subject to adjustment not in excess of an aggregate of 462,843 ordinary shares for nominal consideration. The transaction was closed on July 10, 2018.

On May 21, 2018, the Company announced the expansion of its service offerings with the launch of its financial leasing services. The financial leasing services will be operated through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Xin Quan and Ningbo Ding Tai Financial Leasing Co.

Both subsidiaries will benefit from a corporate income tax exemption for their initial five years, and half exemption for following five years. There are no business operations of the two subsidiaries as of the date of the announcement.

On May 08, 2018, the Company entered into agreement with Heli Kaiyuan to transfer 33.33% equity shared of Xin Quan, with consideration of $nil. Then, Xin Quan's board of directors passed a resolution to increase the registered capital to $50 million from $30 million. And on the same day, the Company signed shareholding entrustment agreement with Heli Kaiyuan to state that Heli Kaiyuan holds 20% equity interest in Xin Quan on behalf of the Company. As a result, the Company holds 60% equity interest in Xin Quan. On August 06, 2018, the change in registration has been completed.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

(NASDAQ: CCIH) and Encourages ChinaCache Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, Aug. 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of investors that purchased ChinaCache International Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ: CCIH) securities between April 10, 2015 and May 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). Investors have until August 12, 2019 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Click here to participate in the action.

The complaint, filed on June 12, 2019, alleges that on April 29, 2019 ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for fiscal year 2018. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (""Chairman""), Song Wang (""Wang""), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

Further, on May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019, because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the ""NASDAQ Letter""). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache's engagement of its new auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

If you purchased ChinaCache securities during the Class Period, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Melissa Fortunato by email at investigations@bespc.com , or telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

(the ""Company"" or ""Del Frisco's"") and L Catterton, the largest and most global consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced the completion of the transaction under which L Catterton has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Del Frisco's for approximately $650 million. As a result of the transaction's close, Del Frisco's stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In conjunction with closing, L Catterton has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille assets to Landry's, Inc. (""Landry's"") for an undisclosed consideration. The transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""We are confident that the separation of the business and the sale of the steak concepts to Landry's creates the best opportunity to unlock value in all of the Company's restaurant brands,"" said Andrew Taub, Managing Partner at L Catterton. ""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Mr. Taub added, ""We look forward to leveraging L Catterton's deep restaurant experience and operational capabilities to help bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar reach their full potential. We are confident that running as separate businesses, these highly experiential and unique restaurant concepts will be best positioned for growth and expansion.""

Landry's, which operates more than 500 high-end and casual dining establishments around the world, including well-known steak concepts Morton's The Steakhouse, Mastro's Restaurants and Strip House, is well-positioned to own the Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille restaurants and maintain their leadership position in the industry.

WeissLaw is also concerned whether the deal creates shareholder value for DFRG's shareholders. Specifically, WeissLaw is investigating whether DFRG's Board conducted a fair process in agreeing to the proposed merger, whether the proposed merger undervalues the Company, and whether all material information related to the proposed merger is fully and fairly disclosed.

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants. As a result, Emmaus common stock and warrants will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market at the start of trading on Wednesday, September 11, 2019. It is expected that the company's common stock and warrants will be eligible for quotation on the OTC market after that date.

In its letter to Emmaus, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel recognized that the company is doing important work and expressed its hope that Emmaus securities may again trade on Nasdaq once the company meets Nasdaq's initial listing standards. Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

About Endari®

Indication

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications. We will continue to focus on our mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies.""

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

Operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was reduced to $1.2 million, versus $7.2 million last year.

As previously disclosed, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI were converted into shares of EMI common stock and cancelled in the merger in exchange for Emmaus shares, with a resulting increase in stockholders' equity. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock at a current conversion price of $9.52, subject to possible future adjustments.

Recent Highlights



Received clearance on its investigational new drug application from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the study of a new L-glutamine treatment for patients suffering from diverticulosis. EMI commenced a pilot/phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of its treatment at multiple study sites, with patents approved in the United States , the EU, China , Russia , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Australia and Indonesia . Emmaus has patents pending related to diverticulosis treatment in Brazil and India .

Entered into an exclusive agreement with taiba Healthcare for the registration, commercialization and distribution of Endari in certain countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

As previously reported, on July 17, 2019, Emmaus, formerly known as ""MYnd Analytics, Inc.,"" completed its merger transaction with EMI, whereby EMI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emmaus and the business of Emmaus became that of EMI. On July 18, 2019, Emmaus common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMA.""

Since the merger transaction occurred subsequent to the 2019 second quarter, Emmaus' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflects the historical business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and operations and financial results of the former MYnd Analytics which were spun off in conjunction with and prior to the merger. As a result, those results bear no relation to the company's current business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations. EMI's historical financial statements, along with pro forma financial information for Emmaus which give effect to the spin off and the merger, can be found in the exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A to be filed on August 14, 2019 which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.

Nasdaq Listing Status Update

Emmaus is currently reviewing a number of options related to maintaining the listing of its common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

Receives Nasdaq Notification of Non-Compliance with Listing Rules,"WUHAN CITY, China, July 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Biqi International Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:BIQI) (""Biqi"" or the ""Company""), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, today announced that on July 8, 2019, the Company received notice (the "" Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Notice"") from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") indicating that its Common Shares did not meet the continued listing requirement as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based on the closing bid price of the Common Shares for the preceding 30 business days.

Under Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company received a 180-calendar day grace period from the date of the Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Notice to regain compliance by meeting the continued listing standard of a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day grace period ending on January 6, 2020.

In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), in addition to such initial grace period, the Company could be afforded an additional 180-calendar day compliance period, provided that on the 180th calendar day of the initial grace period, the Company (i) met the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement) and (ii) notified NASDAQ of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency.

Additionally, in a press release issued on May 9, 2019, it was announced that on May 6, 2019 the Company received a letter (the ""Failure to File Notice"") from NASDAQ stating that, because it had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the ""Form 20-F""), it was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Failure to File Notice stated that the Company had until May 20, 2019 to submit to NASDAQ a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In setting the May 20, 2019 deadline for submitting a plan of compliance, the NASDAQ Staff determined to apply more stringent criteria and shorten the normal time period for the Company to submit its plan. The Failure to File Notice stated that if NASDAQ accepted the Company's plan, then NASDAQ could grant the Company up to 180 days from the prescribed due date for filing the Form 20-F to regain compliance.

On May 20, 2019, the Company submitted its plan for compliance for filing the delinquent Form 20-F in which it undertook to file the Form 20-F by July 31, 2019.

On July 10, 2019, the Company received a letter (the ""Delisting Notice"") from NASDAQ advising the Company that its Staff had determined to deny the Company's request for an extension of time to file its Annual Report on Form 20-­F for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to delist the Company's Common Shares for failing to comply with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In addition, the Delisting Notice stated that conflicting public disclosures in the Company's SEC reports had created a lack of clarity regarding the composition of its Board of Directors, as well as its executive management, raising significant concerns regarding the governance of the Company, which the Staff believed constituted a separate and discrete basis for delisting in the exercise of the discretionary authority granted to the Staff by Listing Rule 5101. Listing Rule 5101 states, in part, that NASDAQ ""...has broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities in NASDAQ in order to maintain the quality of and public confidence in its market, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. NASDAQ may use such discretion to deny initial listing, apply additional or more stringent criteria for the initial or continued listing of particular securities, or suspend or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs that makes initial or continued listing of the securities on NASDAQ inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of NASDAQ, even though the securities meet all enumerated criteria for initial or continued listing on NASDAQ.""

The Notice stated that unless the Company requested an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist its Common Shares, trading of the Common Shares will be suspended at the opening of business on July 19, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Company intends to request a hearing with a Hearings Panel at NASDAQ to appeal the delisting determination and to request a stay of the trading suspension pending the outcome of the hearing. In addition, the Company will submit a plan of compliance to regain compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing of the Company's Common Shares with its request for a hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with such requirements.

The Delisting Determination stated that unless the Company requests an appeal of the Staff's determination to delist the Company's ADSs, trading of the ADSs will be suspended at the opening of business on September 17, 2019, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company's securities from listing and registration on the Nasdaq. After due deliberation, the Company does not intend to appeal the Delisting Determination by requesting a hearing before a hearings panel. After the Company is delisted from the Nasdaq, its ADSs may be traded over-the-counter on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the ""pink sheets"" if one or more market makers seeks and obtains approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to continue quoting in the Company's ADSs. Many over-the-counter stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the Nasdaq, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of the Company's ADSs.

This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a Staff delisting determination.

This research evaluates key technologies involved in digital transformation including 5G, AI, Big Data Analytics, Blockchain, Cloud and Mobile Edge Computing, Connected and Wearable Devices, Cybersecurity, Digital Twins and Teleoperation, IoT, Robotics, Smart Cities, and Virtual Reality solutions.

These technologies will all be germane to the evolution of many areas important to enterprise and industrial organizations including internal and external processes, products and services, virtualization, OSS/BSS, and more.

The enterprise and industrial sectors are rapidly digitizing their products and services including software-controlled and virtualized infrastructure as well as leveraging next-generation connectivity, signaling, and automated decision-making algorithms. This will have a profound effect on both overall strategic positioning and day to day tactical operations. New technologies and tools being rapidly integrated into production and service systems, which are facilitating the transformation of processes, creating new business opportunities, and enabling an overall smarter workplace for humans and machines alike.



Telecom infrastructure and services providers are also undergoing a massive transformation. For example, the combination of 5G and edge computing will transform wireless carrier operations and facilitate enhanced services, new applications, and completely new business models for mobile network operators. In addition, software-defined control and infrastructure virtualization are poised to transform network and service architecture thanks to improvements in technologies that offer improved performance and lower costs. As the border between cloud computing and network infrastructure continues to blur, so does the demarcation between the network as a whole and those network elements (servers, terminals, etc.) that comprise the network.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms enhance the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The combination of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to dramatically accelerate the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The author sees the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) as transformational for both technologies as AI adds value to IoT through machine learning and decision making and IoT adds value to AI through connectivity and data exchange.



AIoT solutions dramatically accelerating the benefits of digital transformation for consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective smart city solutions in terms of decision making. 5G provides substantial bandwidth where needed as well as significantly lower latency for next-generation applications and services such as virtual reality controlled teleoperation and other enhanced user interfaces.



We see smart cities providing significant opportunities for technology integration in support of highly customized, yet scalable services. There will be a positive feedback loop created and sustained by leveraging the interdependent capabilities of AI, IoT, and 5G (AIoT5G). For example, AI will work in conjunction with IoT to substantially improve smart city supply chains. Metropolitan area supply chains represent complex systems of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer.



The Industrial IoT (IIoT) market is much more than the sum of its parts, but its parts alone can be daunting, especially considering how emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and modified reality is being rapidly integrated into industrial processes. AI alone is anticipated to dramatically reduce costs and improve processes as well as facilitate completely new products and services that improve production, quality, and the producer-supplier relationship.



This is the most comprehensive research available anywhere that evaluates each of these technologies and assesses their convergence and integration opportunities. The research provides a wide-ranging view into the ecosystem including companies, strategies, and solutions for each technical domain as well as cross-domain implementation and operations. The research provides detailed forecasts by application and service, use case, and industry vertical.

This report provides an in-depth assessment of the global Big Data market, including business case issues/analysis, application use cases, vendor landscape, value chain analysis, and a quantitative assessment of the industry with forecasting from 2019 to 2024. This report also evaluates the components of Big Data infrastructure and security framework.



Report Findings

Big data in cognitive computing will reach $12.6B USD globally by 2024

globally by 2024 Big data application infrastructure will reach $9.1B USD globally by 2024

globally by 2024 Big data in public safety and homeland security will reach $5.3B USD globally by 2024

globally by 2024 Real-time data will be a key value proposition for all use cases, segments, and solutions

Market leading companies are rapidly integrated big data technologies with IoT infrastructure

The big data market consists of infrastructure providers, data centers, data as a service providers, and other vendors. Solutions for managing unstructured data are evolving beyond systems aligned towards primarily human-generated data (such as social networking, messaging, and browsing habits) towards increasingly greater emphasis upon machine-generated data found across many industry verticals.



For example, manufacturing and healthcare are anticipated to create massive amounts of data that may be rendered useful only through advanced analytics and various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as machine learning and cognitive computing. The long-term prospect for these technologies is that they will become embedded in many different other technologies and provide autonomous decision making on behalf of humans, both directly, and indirectly through many processes, products, and services.



Emerging networks and systems such as IoT and edge computing will generate substantial amounts of unstructured data, which will present both technical challenges and market opportunities for operating companies and their vendors. Emerging big data tools such as open APIs much be implemented to facilitate data capture and processing with the ability to perform localized processing and decision making.



Big data solution provider dynamics are evolving almost as much as the data management technologies themselves. While some companies rely upon proprietary solutions, many leading companies such as Hortonworks and Cloudera offer products and services primarily based on open source Apache Hadoop technology. One important distinction between market leaders is collaboration vs. competition. For example, Cloudera competes with IBM, Microsoft, and others in data science and AI whereas Hortonworks partners with these companies.



In terms of data management and analytics technologies, the big data industry is experiencing profound changes across the entire stack including infrastructure, security, analytics, and the application layer. The data services industry as a whole is shifting from host-based network topologies to cloud-based, data-centric architectures, thereby creating enormous challenges and opportunities for transitioning and securing data systems. In concert with this shift, big data infrastructure will require strategic governance and framework for optimized security.



Advanced analytics provide the ability to make raw data meaningful and useful as information for decision-making purposes. AI enhances the ability for big data analytics and IoT platforms to provide value to each of these market segments. The use of AI for decision making in IoT and data analytics will be crucial for efficient and effective decision making, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks.



The ability to capture streaming data, determine valuable attributes, and make decisions in real-time will add an entirely new dimension to service logic. In many cases, the data itself, and actionable information will be the service. However, real-time data is anticipated to become a highly valuable aspect of all solutions as a determinant of user behavior, application effectiveness, and an identifier of new and enhanced mobile/wireless and/or IoT related apps and services.



Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) are perhaps best known as data-intensive immersive technologies that require high bandwidth for operations. One of the least evaluated opportunities is the market opportunities associated with visualizing data and information in AR, VR, and MR environments. Much of this data will be unstructured, requiring big data analytics tools to process, categorize, and display in a meaningful manner. This will allow the end user to visualize and utilize information in ways previously inconceivable.



In addition, leading data management companies are developing tools for improved general data visualization, facilitating improved information interpretation and decision making. Coupled with AI and cognitive computing, the field of advanced data visualization and analytics known as augmented analytics is transforming otherwise useless data into highly valuable and actionable smart data, often enabling dynamic decision making that may positively impact business operations as processes, transactions, and other events occur. Much of this smart data will be monetized in a data as a service approach by enterprise thanks to leading big data service provider solutions.



Additional topics covered in this report include:

Market Analysis and Forecasts: Global and regional assessment of the market size and forecasts for 2019 to 2024

This report also includes analysis and forecasts for streaming data analytics. IoT facilitates vast amounts of fast-moving data from sensors and devices. For many use cases, data flows constantly from the device or sensor to the network and sometimes back to the device. In some cases, these streams of data are simply stored (for potential later use) and in other cases, there is a need for real-time data processing and analytics.

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, announced today that it was informed yesterday that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had declined to reverse the Nasdaq Listing Qualification's decision to delist Emmaus common stock and warrants. As a result, Emmaus common stock and warrants will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market at the start of trading on Wednesday, September 11, 2019. It is expected that the company's common stock and warrants will be eligible for quotation on the OTC market after that date.

In its letter to Emmaus, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel recognized that the company is doing important work and expressed its hope that Emmaus securities may again trade on Nasdaq once the company meets Nasdaq's initial listing standards. Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

Recent company highlights include:

Reported sharply improved 2019 second quarter results, with net revenues up 128% year-over-year to $5.9 million from $2.6 million , as the company continues to commercialize its sickle cell disease drug.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications. We will continue to focus on our mission of improving the lives of people in need through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies.""

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

Operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was reduced to $1.2 million, versus $7.2 million last year.

As previously disclosed, in conjunction with and immediately prior to the merger, approximately $35.5 million principal amount of, and accrued interest on, outstanding convertible promissory notes and notes payable of EMI were converted into shares of EMI common stock and cancelled in the merger in exchange for Emmaus shares, with a resulting increase in stockholders' equity. This conversion is expected to save Emmaus approximately $3.6 million in annual interest expense, which should benefit future cash flows. Additionally, in conjunction with the merger, EMI's outstanding 10% senior secured debentures were amended and restated to extend their maturity date by six months to October 21, 2020 and to make the debentures convertible into common stock at a current conversion price of $9.52, subject to possible future adjustments.

Recent Highlights



Received clearance on its investigational new drug application from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the study of a new L-glutamine treatment for patients suffering from diverticulosis. EMI commenced a pilot/phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of its treatment at multiple study sites, with patents approved in the United States , the EU, China , Russia , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Australia and Indonesia . Emmaus has patents pending related to diverticulosis treatment in Brazil and India .

, the EU, , , , , , and . Emmaus has patents pending related to diverticulosis treatment in and . Commenced a clinical study to determine the efficacy of the company's pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine in lowering blood sugar in patients with type II diabetes.

Signed an agreement with Express Scripts, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBM), and launched a commercial co-payment assistance program to help ensure that patients in need have access to Endari.

Entered into an exclusive agreement with taiba Healthcare for the registration, commercialization and distribution of Endari in certain countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

As previously reported, on July 17, 2019, Emmaus, formerly known as ""MYnd Analytics, Inc.,"" completed its merger transaction with EMI, whereby EMI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emmaus and the business of Emmaus became that of EMI. On July 18, 2019, Emmaus common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMA.""

Since the merger transaction occurred subsequent to the 2019 second quarter, Emmaus' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflects the historical business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and operations and financial results of the former MYnd Analytics which were spun off in conjunction with and prior to the merger. As a result, those results bear no relation to the company's current business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations. EMI's historical financial statements, along with pro forma financial information for Emmaus which give effect to the spin off and the merger, can be found in the exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A to be filed on August 14, 2019 which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.

In the event the appeal is unsuccessful, Emmaus common stock may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Market.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children are born with sickle cell disease.

Taps SB360 As Exclusive Consultant To Conduct Store Closing Sales In The Last Remaining 81 Fred's Stores,"BOSTON, Sept. 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fred's Inc., a discount value retailer, has once again tapped SB360 Capital Partners as their exclusive consultant to conduct Store Closing Sales in all 81 remaining Fred's locations. SB360 Capital Partners (www.sb360.com), one of North America's leading asset disposition specialists, has closed 442 Fred's locations since April of this year.

Fred's Inc. filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Court gave interim approval yesterday to the retention of SB360 as a consultant for the Sale.

The Company expects to continue fulfilling pharmacy prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations, while it continues to pursue the sale of its pharmacies as part of the court supervised proceedings.

Fred's was founded in 1947 and serves small communities throughout the southeastern United States. Fred's offers value-priced products across categories that fulfill everyday needs – food, fresh goods, snacks, soda, toiletries, over-the-counter medications, household products, hardware, sporting goods, lawn & garden, toys, and much more. Aside from big-box competitors, Fred's is frequently the dominant value retailer in the communities that it serves.

Ziggy Schaffer, Executive Vice President of SB360, said, ""Fred's stores are well known and a part of everyday life in the communities they serve. Shoppers know they can find what they want when they want it, and always at a value-price.""

""In many of their locations, Fred's stores are the most convenient shopping destination,"" said Aaron Miller, Executive Vice President of SB360. ""Fred's customers are in the store every week, and in some cases, multiple times each week.""

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller agreed the customer response will be overwhelming. ""What we've seen over the last few months is how quickly customers respond to the Closing Sales. They buy cartloads. They buy in bulk. The discounts we offer off Fred's lowest marked price allows customers to stock up and have money left over. It's value on top of value.""

Mr. Miller continued, ""We encourage shoppers to take advantage of the great deals early in the sale. Quantities are very limited, and we expect shelves to clear quickly.""

The Sale in these additional stores starts today.

Fred's Pharmacies within each of the locations will be unaffected by the closures. The Fred's Pharmacy team will continue to serve all of their customer's prescription needs.

Since early April, SB360 has worked with Fred's management, market leaders, and store teams to conduct Store Closing Sales. One group of 105 Fred's stores will wrap up sales and close for business over the next week.

When they see the discounts, word travels fast. Fred's shoppers know if they don't buy early, what they want may not be there later.""

Fred's store teams work hard to keep the shelves stocked. But after a few days of the Closing Sale, the backrooms are empty and the stores start condensing the remaining product.

Mr. Schaffer and Mr. Miller emphasized, ""The best advice we can give is to shop the Fred's stores early in the Sale for best selection.""

(NYSE: MTN) today announced it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Peak Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKIS) at a purchase price of $11.00 per share, subject to certain conditions, including regulatory review and Peak Resorts' shareholder approval.

Photo Credit: Brett Miller, Peak Resorts, Mount Snow

Through the acquisition, Vail Resorts will add 17 U.S. ski areas to its network of world-class resorts. Located near major metropolitan areas, including New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Columbus, St. Louis, Kansas City and Louisville, the resorts include:

Mount Snow in Vermont

in Hunter Mountain in New York

in Attitash Mountain Resort , Wildcat Mountain and Crotched Mountain in New Hampshire

, and in Liberty Mountain Resort , Roundtop Mountain Resort , Whitetail Resort , Jack Frost and Big Boulder in Pennsylvania

, , , and in Alpine Valley , Boston Mills , Brandywine and Mad River Mountain in Ohio

, , and in Hidden Valley and Snow Creek in Missouri

and in Paoli Peaks in Indiana

""We are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to add such a powerful network of ski areas to our Company,"" said Rob Katz, chairman and chief executive officer of Vail Resorts. ""Peak Resorts' ski areas in the Northeast are a perfect complement to our existing resorts and together will provide a very compelling offering to our guests in New York and Boston. With this acquisition, we are also able to make a much stronger connection to guests in critical cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest and build on the success we have already seen with our strategy in Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit. The acquisition fully embodies our philosophy of Epic for Everyone, making skiing and riding more accessible to guests across the U.S. and around the world.""

""The ski areas within the Peak Resorts portfolio exemplify the spirit of our sport as well as our Company's mission to provide an Experience of a Lifetime to guests,"" Katz continued. ""We're thrilled to welcome the resorts and their employees into the Vail Resorts family and invest in their continued success.""

""Vail Resorts has a proven track record of celebrating the unique identity of its resorts, while continually investing in the guest and employee experience. For this reason, we are confident that our resorts and employees will continue to thrive within the Vail Resorts network,"" said Timothy Boyd, president and chief executive officer of Peak Resorts. ""We are very proud of our track record over the last two decades in building the breadth, quality and accessibility of our resorts. We are thrilled that our guests will now have access to some of the world's most renowned resorts.""

When the transaction closes, the 2019-20 Epic Pass, Epic Local Pass and Military Epic Pass will include unlimited and unrestricted access to the 17 Peak Resorts ski areas. Guests with an Epic Day Pass will also be able to access the new ski areas as a part of the total number of days purchased. For the 2019-20 season, Vail Resorts will honor and continue to sell all Peak Resorts pass products, and Peak Resorts' pass holders will have the option to upgrade to an Epic Pass or Epic Local Pass, following closing of the transaction.

Additional Transaction Details

The aggregate purchase price for all Peak Resorts common stock is estimated to be approximately $264 million (calculated on a treasury method basis), which Vail Resorts intends to finance through a combination of cash on hand, its existing revolver facility and an expansion of its existing credit facility. In addition, Vail Resorts will be assuming or refinancing Peak Resorts' outstanding debt.

The acquisition is expected to generate incremental annual EBITDA of approximately $60 million in Vail Resorts' fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, the first fiscal year with the full benefit of the synergies of the acquisition, with additional revenue upside in future years. Synergies are expected to come from additional revenue across the Vail Resorts network of resorts and cost reductions from the elimination of certain duplicative administrative functions and greater efficiencies brought by Vail Resorts' size and scale. Vail Resorts' annual ongoing capital expenditures are expected to increase by $10 million to support the addition of the Peak Resorts ski areas. After closing of the transaction, Vail Resorts plans to invest approximately $15 million over the next two years in one-time capital spending to elevate the guest experience at these resorts.

The transaction was approved by both companies' Boards of Directors, and the Peak Resorts Board of Directors also recommends that Peak Resorts' shareholders approve the transaction.

The transaction is expected to close this fall. The parties expect operations at all Peak Resorts ski areas to continue in the ordinary course of business. Upon closing, Vail Resorts plans to retain the vast majority of each resort's employees.

WeissLaw is investigating whether SKIS' Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the merger agreement. Notably, the Company recently announced record-breaking financial results. It reported revenue of $184.42 million for the year ended April 30, 2019, representing an increase of $52.76 million over the $131.66 million reported in the same period of the previous year. According to SKIS' President and CEO, ""[f]iscal 2019 was a record year for [SKIS] . . . Revenue and Reported EBITDA grew 53% and 72% year over year in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, respectively, as we generated organic revenue and Reported EBITDA growth of a respective 11% and 14%.""

Given these facts, WeissLaw is concentrating its investigation on whether the merger enhances SKIS' shareholder value. Specifically, WeissLaw is concerned whether SKIS' Board conducted a fair process in agreeing to the proposed merger, whether the proposed merger undervalues the Company, and whether all material information related to the proposed merger is fully and fairly disclosed.

Repay Holdings Corporation | TBRGU,PRNewswire,https://news.google.com./articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvcmVwYXktdG8tbWVyZ2Utd2l0aC10aHVuZGVyLWJyaWRnZS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1sdGQtMzAwNzgxOTQyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2019-01-22T08:00:00Z,2019-10-07-13-57,"REPAY to Merge with Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd.","ATLANTA and GREAT FALLS, Va., Jan. 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Repay Holdings, LLC, a leading provider of vertically-integrated payment solutions, together with its parent, Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC (together, ""REPAY""), and Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd. (NASDAQ: TBRG) (""Thunder Bridge""), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Thunder Bridge will acquire REPAY and the combined company (the ""Company"") will continue as a publicly-listed company with an implied enterprise value at closing of approximately $653 million, based on current assumptions.

Upon the close of the transaction, the Company intends to change its name to Repay Holdings Corporation and is expected to continue to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market under a new ticker symbol. REPAY's management team, led by John Morris, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Shaler Alias, Co-Founder and President, and Tim Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, will continue to lead the Company. REPAY's existing majority equity holder, Corsair Capital, a leading private equity investor in the financial services industry, is expected to remain the Company's largest stockholder.

REPAY processed approximately $7 billion of payment volume in 2018 across diverse verticals, such as personal loans, automotive loans and receivables management. Management believes these verticals are underserved and accordingly provide significant growth opportunities over the next several years. The Company serves more than 3,000 clients via a proprietary, omni-channel payment platform that reduces complexity for merchants and enhances the consumer experience. In addition to highly-recurring revenue, REPAY has achieved strong Adjusted EBITDA growth over the last three years through market expansion, increased penetration of existing customers, new client wins and strategic acquisitions.

Gary Simanson, President and CEO of Thunder Bridge, said, ""REPAY has achieved impressive growth while also delivering high levels of profitability in an exciting and underpenetrated area of the payments sector. John Morris and his team have developed a technology platform that is well-positioned with over 50 software integration partnerships to service customers with a footprint representing more than 11,000 locations across the country. We are looking forward to partnering with REPAY's management team and Corsair in the next stage of the Company's development.""

""We are very excited to continue to execute on REPAY's growth plan as a public company and greatly appreciate Corsair's continued involvement and partnership,"" said John Morris, co-founder and CEO of REPAY. ""We have developed a compelling tech-enabled value proposition that allows our merchants to expand the scope and depth of their services to meet the evolving needs of their customers. As a publicly-listed company, we will have access to capital to further support our acquisition strategy and invest in technology while continuing to develop software integration partners. We remain focused on delivering the highest levels of service to our merchants as we strengthen our leading position in the industry.""

James Kirk, Managing Director of Corsair Capital, commented, ""We are proud of all REPAY has achieved since Corsair's investment in 2016, and we look forward to continuing to support the Company's development of value-added payment solutions. With over $500 billion of total payment volume, including over $200 billion of debit payment volume, projected next year across REPAY's existing verticals and the ongoing evaluation of a pipeline of potential acquisition targets, we believe there are significant growth opportunities for the business in the future.""

""The payments industry is one of the most dynamic segments of the financial services space, and REPAY has established itself as an integrated player and early-mover in an important and underserved sector of the market,"" added Jeremy Schein, Managing Director of Corsair Capital. ""Given REPAY's growth and history of pioneering innovative payment solutions, we see compelling opportunities ahead and look forward to our continued partnership with the REPAY management team.""

Transaction Summary

The transaction reflects an implied enterprise value at closing of $653 million, based on current assumptions. The cash component of the purchase price to be paid to the equity holders of REPAY is expected to be funded by Thunder Bridge's cash in trust and debt financing, for which a commitment has been obtained. The balance of the consideration payable to the existing REPAY equity holders will consist of equity interests of the surviving subsidiary which will be exchangeable into shares of common stock of the Company at the option of such equity holders. Existing REPAY equity holders have the potential to receive an earnout of additional equity interests of the surviving subsidiary if certain stock price targets are met as set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Corsair Capital and the REPAY management team will remain investors by rolling over significant equity into the combined company.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Thunder Bridge will domesticate from a Cayman Islands exempted company to a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge will merge with and into Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC, with Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge. The corporate name of Thunder Bridge will change to Repay Holdings Corporation.

The transactions have been unanimously approved by the boards of both REPAY and Thunder Bridge. Completion of the transactions is subject to approval by the stockholders of Thunder Bridge and certain other conditions. The transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.

Additional information about the business combination will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will contain an investor presentation to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and available at www.sec.gov. In addition, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC.

Advisors

Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, and CLSA acted as capital markets advisors and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP acted as legal counsel to Thunder Bridge. Financial Technology Partners served as strategic and financial advisor, Credit Suisse as capital markets advisor, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Troutman Sanders as legal counsel to REPAY in this transaction.

Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

In addition to factors previously disclosed in Thunder Bridge's reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: inability to meet the closing conditions to the business combination, including the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of Thunder Bridge's shareholders, the inability to consummate the contemplated debt financing, the failure to achieve the minimum amount of cash available following any redemptions by Thunder Bridge shareholders or the failure to meet The Nasdaq Stock Market's listing standards in connection with the consummation of the contemplated transactions; costs related to the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement; a delay or failure to realize the expected benefits from the proposed transaction; risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; changes in the payment processing market in which REPAY competes, including with respect to its competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory changes; changes in the vertical markets that REPAY targets; risks relating to REPAY's relationships within the payment ecosystem; risk that REPAY may not be able to execute its growth strategies, including identifying and executing acquisitions; risks relating to data security; and risk that REPAY may not be able to develop and maintain effective internal controls.

Actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. All information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof in the case of information about Thunder Bridge and REPAY or the date of such information in the case of information from persons other than Thunder Bridge or REPAY, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this communication. Forecasts and estimates regarding REPAY's industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT

For additional information on the proposed transaction, see Thunder Bridge's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed concurrently. In connection with the proposed transaction, Thunder Bridge intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a proxy statement/prospectus of Thunder Bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. Before making any voting or investment decision, investors and stockholders of Thunder Bridge are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus, when they become available, and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. The documents filed by Thunder Bridge with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, or by directing a request to Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd., 9912 Georgetown Pike, Suite D203, Great Falls, Virginia 22066, Attention: Secretary, (202) 431-0507

PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION

Thunder Bridge and REPAY and certain of their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in favor of the approval of the business combination. Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed participants in the solicitation of the stockholders of Thunder Bridge in connection with the proposed business combination will be set forth in the registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a proxy statement/prospectus, when it becomes available. Information regarding Thunder Bridge's directors and executive officers are set forth in Thunder Bridge's Registration Statement on Form S-1, including amendments thereto, and other reports which are filed with the SEC. Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REPAY uses certain non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its business, measure its performance and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income prior to interest expense and depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to add back certain non-cash charges and account for non-recurring items, such as other expenses, non-cash gain from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction expenses, share-based compensation charges, and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP but instead considered alongside such measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in the industry may calculate it differently from how REPAY calculates it, reducing its overall usefulness. This communication does not provide a reconciliation of any forward-looking, estimated non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because calculating the components would involve numerous estimates and judgments that are unduly burdensome to prepare and may imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or potentially misleading to investors.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading, and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain. The details and updates regarding the lawsuit are as follows:

1. The Company Established a Special Committee for Internal Investigation

A week after HR published its Report on the Company, the Company established a special committee (the ""Special Committee"") composed of independent directors to carry out a special internal investigation, for the purpose of investigating each allegation published in HR's Report. The Company took into consideration that HR's Report mainly referred to the Company's subsidiary in Wuhan, China, and its projects. The Special Committee consisted of the Company's personnel in China, led primarily by independent directors Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu. Mr. Zhihong Su is an independent director of the Company and also a member of the Company's Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Governance and Human Resources Committee under the Company's Board of Directors. Since December 2001, Mr. Su has also been a managing partner of Beijing Hengjun Law Firm, a law firm that provides services in securities, business, and litigation, and is also familiar with corporate and banking law. Mr. Tongmin Wang is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Zhixue Liu is an independent director of the Company and a member of the Board of Supervisors Committee. The Special Committee's review included, but was not limited to, reviewing the relevant financial records, public documents, lease agreements, and court documents of the Company's Wuhan subsidiary.

2. Filing of Lawsuit against HR and Related Personnel Based on the Findings and Proposals of the Company's Special Committee

Upon conclusion of the investigation, Mr. Zhihong Su, Mr. Tongmin Wang, and Mr. Zhixue Liu orally presented the Special Committee's investigations to the Company's Board of Directors, and proposed to file a lawsuit against HR. The Company then proceeded to file a defamation lawsuit against the Defendants on January 23, 2019, which the Company correspondingly announced through its January 24, 2019 8-K filing.

3. The Special Committee's Findings and Details Regarding the Complaint

In the Complaint, the Company systematically enumerated and refuted the errors contained in the Report, and pled the following causes of action against HR and related personnel (collectively, the ""Defendants""): (i) defamation per se, (ii) defamation, (iii) tortious interference with prospective business relations, (iv) tortious interference with contract, (v) civil conspiracy, and (vi) common law fraud. The Company also claimed that after creating one or more ""short"" positions in the Company's stock, Defendants conspired to publish, publicize, and disseminate its erroneous Report in order to jointly manipulate and depress the Company's stock price. After publishing the false report, Defendants republished and directed online ""traffic"" through one or more websites and social media accounts to the Report, which was replete with false, misleading, and defamatory statements. Additional information regarding the Special Committee's findings can be found in the Complaint, available online on the New York State Unified Court System's website:

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=3hZXjsLXc_PLUS_DKCyi0KWoJyQ==&system=prod

4. Litigation Progress

The Lawsuit against HR continues to proceed in the Supreme Court of New York. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint, and oral arguments for the same motion was originally scheduled for August 14, 2019, but the Court adjourned the hearing until October 7, 2019.

After the Report was released, the Company's market capitalization was reduced by nearly $2 billion, which caused huge losses to all of the Company's shareholders. Management believes that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit, and any resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

(collectively, ""Defendants"") in response to their coordinated and orchestrated market manipulation scheme to disseminate false, misleading and defamatory content to the marketplace regarding the Company for the purpose of inflicting substantial reputational harm on the Company for Defendants' own financial gain.

""We feel as a company the best way to fight the short and distort strategy of our accuser is to operate and litigate. Our assets have been acquired and developed with real cash payments; and, the long term investment opportunity for profit leveraging our assets will ring true for our investors. This is a long and calculated battle with these short sellers, and we intend to fight with all of our capabilities using every resource available to us. We have a bright future as a member of the global economy and we look forward to the first steps on a long journey,"" said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

The impetus for the action was a false, misleading and defamatory unsigned article published on December 6, 2018 through one of the Defendants' aliases, ""Hindenburg Research,"" which erroneously accused Yangtze of making fraudulent misrepresentations in its public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") or intentionally omitting material information in those filings, laundering money through sham transactions for the benefit of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and being ensnared in a catastrophic liquidity crisis rendering the Company worthless.

As the Company's Complaint establishes with supporting evidence that was publicly filed with the SEC, the statements made in the Defendants' report are not only demonstrably false and misleading, but also nothing more than a ""short and distort"" attack on the Company for the financial gain of those Defendants, who concede in the Report that they ""are short YRIV"".

In the meantime, the Company has suffered a disastrous fallout from Defendants' coordinated attack, resulting in, among other things, reputational damage per se and monetary damages, which the Company seeks to redress through its lawsuit. The Company is confident that through this lawsuit, it will achieve the necessary legal recourse to compensate it for Defendants' wrongful actions and rehabilitate its reputation, enabling the Company to, once again, develop and continue to grow financially for the benefit of its shareholders.

On YRIV's latest quarterly balance sheet, the rights to the land are reported as having a value of $299 million, comprising over 77% of the company's total assets… Despite claiming to lease 1.2 million square meters from the village, our government-sourced maps…show that the total area of the village is only 610 thousand square meters. Moreover, conversations with officials from the village in question revealed that contrary to the company's claims, YRIV has not leased any land from them.""

The value of $299 million reflected in the Company's latest quarterly balance sheet is not related to the 1.2 million square meters of land. Instead, the reported value of $299 million relates to the value of land use rights of the unused portion of 6 parcels of commercial land (steel logistics park). Originally, the value of these land use rights of the 6 parcels of commercial land totaling 515,600 square meters, was booked at a cost of $308 million , of which 79,200 square meters of land have been used for constructing commercial buildings with 92,700 square meters of floor area, leaving 436,400 square meters of unused land. It is this unused piece of land that we have reported a value of $299 million . As of today, due to the significant appreciation of the local real estate market, we estimate that the 515,600 square meters of land that the Company has obtained land use right certificates for and was accounted at cost value, has nearly doubled to a value of nearly $600 million .

The Company's lease of 1.2 million square meters of land mentioned in the Report comprises land not only from the Chunfeng Village but also Junmin Village and Jiangdi Village, which were brokered and represented through Chunfeng Village.

2. Undisclosed Legal Judgments

A list of the 11 undisclosed legal judgments mentioned in the Report is set forth below:

Items 1-6 relate to the litigation and judgements arising from the sale of commercial house flats by the Company's subsidiary, Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd. (""Wuhan Newport""). These commercial house flats were sold in or before 2015. According to the relevant contracts of sale, if Wuhan Newport fails to develop the area in accordance with its original development plan within one year after the sale and purchase, Wuhan Newport would have to repurchase the commercial house flats at the original contracted price back from the purchasers. These proceedings were instituted by the purchasers before the said properties appreciated and doubled in value between 2017 and 2018. Consequently, the purchasers are now reluctant to enforce the judgments and sell back the properties to Wuhan Newport. The Company has already made provisions for the purchase of the properties in the financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Because the judgments were already rendered, the Company has not disclosed these judgements as ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Item 7 refers to the loan of RMB 290 million due to China Construction Bank Gangcheng Branch dated May 28, 2014 mentioned in the Report, plus interest totaling approximately RMB 325 million , and not in addition to such loan. The loan and interest payable obligations have been disclosed and accounted for in the Company's financial statements in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2017 .

The Company is in the process of negotiating a loan restructure with the bank and in the meantime, all payments due are suspended. Also, as a result of negotiations, the bank has not instituted enforcement proceedings. As in the above Items 1-6, because a judgement has already been rendered, the Company has not disclosed it as an ongoing ""Legal Proceedings"".

Items 8-11 refer to judgements obtained against Wuhan Newport as a guarantor for certain loans taken out by a large shareholder of Wuhan Newport before it became a subsidiary of the Company. Since the judgments were rendered, the shareholder has undertaken in writing to be solely responsible for all these loans without recourse to Wuhan Newport and has entered into a repayment plan with his creditor(s). Accordingly, no enforcement actions have been instituted against Wuhan Newport and in accordance with legal opinion from PRC counsel, there are no legal or financial liability accorded to Wuhan Newport.

3. Money from YRIV's Capital Raises Has Been Used to Pay the Chairman/Controlling Shareholder Rather Than Advance Company's Projects

The Report alleges that the Company has consistently reported large liability balances ""due to related parties"" on its financial statements. These, in turn, seem to accrue large interest rates which simply get added to the ""advances"" over time. When capital is raised, cash is then used to pay back the supposed related-party ""advances"", rather than being employed to further the company's projects.

Ever since the closing of the reverse merger in December 2015 , the Company has taken out 19 short-term loans via convertible notes totaling $8.546 million . The money from these loans was mainly used for paying the proposed upfront deposit payments for acquiring another entity, Wuhan Economic Development Port Limited (""Wuhan Port EDP""). Because the acquisition of Wuhan Port EDP as aborted, the Company began repaying the convertible notes from the loan proceeds. As of the end of November 2018 , the Company has repaid $9.031 million ( $7.846 million in principal plus $1.184 million in interest), leaving an unpaid principal of $699,000 .

Contrary to the Report, the Company's CEO, Mr. Xiangyao Liu has not only not received a penny from these loans but has advanced as much as $485,000 towards the payment of the $9.031 million by the Company and will likewise advance the forthcoming redemption of an unexpired principal of $699,000 plus interest.

Hindenburg quoted the following from the Company's Quarter Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 :

The Report concluded that there was a total repayment of ""loans"" of approximately $6.2 million to Mr. Liu. This is not the case. The Report focused on the numbers highlighted in the red circles but neglected the increased amounts highlighted in the green circles which showed increased advances from Mr. Liu to the Company. The net effect of the aforementioned numbers shows a net advance from Mr. Liu to the Company. In addition, as mentioned in the Report, ""the total amount of those 19 convertible notes amounted to $8.5 million, of which $3.39 million is outstanding while $5.15 million has been redeemed."" As such, there is no way that Mr. Liu would have received $6.2 million from the proceeds of the notes.

""The Report contains numerous errors of facts and misleading speculations that are libelous and we categorically deny such speculations. This Report is largely a rehash of prior allegations made against us and only focuses on certain discrete information to cultivate a distorted view of the Company"", said Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ""We have not granted access to Hindenburg nor has Hindenberg ever contacted us to seek any clarification or explanation to the allegations made. These speculations have caused significant damage to our Company and we are resolved to take such actions necessary to defend ourselves and protect the interests of our shareholders. Additionally, we have instructed counsel to explore our recourse against Hindenburg for making such irresponsible, baseless and libelous statements, including but not limited to instituting legal proceedings against them. We are committed to a high level of corporate governance and stand by the integrity of our financial statements and business operations. We will be conducting a special internal investigation into the other allegations made and will report the outcome of such investigation in due course.""

Full Year 2018 Financial Results

Interest and fee income

For the year of 2018, total interest and fee income, which include interest and fees on its direct lending loans, management and assessment service fees and interest on deposits with banks, was $0.26 million, compared to $16.53 million for the prior year. The significant decrease in loans issued was caused by a combined effect of business slow-down of the direct lending loans in Xinjiang area as a result of management assessment of economic environment in supply chain financing in Urumqi and increasing past due loan receivable and interest receivable which resulted in reversal of interest income. since the second half of 2017.

Interest expenses

The Company used borrowed funds, including short-term bank loans, secured loan and loans from third parties, to fund its direct lending business. Total interest expenses decreased by $0.47 million, or 6.4%, to $6.90 million for the year of 2018 from $ 7.37 million for the prior year mainly due to interest penalty from overdue loans. The loans with the amount of $154.41 million were overdue.

Provision for loan losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance ASU 2016-13 for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, which is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information and will likely result in earlier recognition of credit reserves.

CECL adoption will have broad impact on the financial statements of financial services firms, which will affect key profitability and solvency measures. Some of the more notable expected changes include:

Higher loan loss reserve levels and related deferred tax assets. While different asset types will be impacted differently, the expectation is that reserve levels will generally increase across the board for all financial firms.

Increased reserve levels may lead to a reduction in capital levels.

As a result of higher reserving levels, the expectation is that CECL will reduce cyclicality in financial firms' results, as higher reserving in ""good times"" will mean that less dramatic reserve increases will be loan related income (which will continue to be recognized on a periodic basis based on the effective interest method) and the related credit losses (which will be recognized up front at origination). This will make periods of loan expansion seem less profitable due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Periods of stable or declining loan levels will look comparatively profitable as the income trickles in for loans, where losses had been previously recognized.

Provision for loan losses increased by $30.42 million, or 55%, to $85.72 million for the year of 2018 from $55.30 million for the prior year. The increase was mainly related to more loans past due over 180 days as compared to that during the year ended December 31, 2017 as certain customers were facing financial difficulties since the second half of 2017 that caused increased provision rate charged for loan losses for the year 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management continued to assess the adequacy of the allowances in a cautious manner. Management assessed the collectability of loan receivable balances on an individual basis and concluded the collection from certain borrowers is remote . The following table summarizes provisions for loan losses.

At the end of each period, we conduct an aging analysis of each customer's arrears to determine whether the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. In establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider historical experience, the economic environment, trends in the construction industry, expected collectability of amounts receivable that are past due, and the expected collectability of overdue receivables. An estimate of doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. As a result, total allowance of $128.93 million was recorded for the year of 2018, compared to $64.29 million for the prior year. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had 75 and 59 business loan customers, and 159 and 174 personal loan customers, respectively. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

Financial Condition and Going Concern

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.31 million, compared to $1.22 million as of December 31, 2017. Net loans receivable was $92.58 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $117.26 million at the end of 2017. Short-term bank loans, loans from a cost method investee, loans from third parties and secured loan were $7.98 million, $14.54 million, $3.31 million and $79.21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to $11.97 million, $15.37 million, $nil and $15.34 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.

Most of our customers are MSMEs and individual proprietors located in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province and Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Our customers are involved in the commerce and service, energy and mining, real estate, agriculture and husbandry, supply chain financing, construction and decoration, manufacturing, consumer credit and other industries. In particular, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, loans to the tire supply chain financing industry accounts for 35.9% and 46.5% of total amounts of loans originated by the Company, loans to commerce and service industry accounts for 24.9% and 39.8% of total amount of loans, and loans to construction and decoration industry accounts for 23.0% and nil of total amount of loans. The capital liquidity of the Company was also influenced consequently due to a decrease in cash inflows provided by operating activities. The company's operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and if the Company will be able to maintain profitability and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and /or manage operating expense in line with revenue forecasts, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability.

The Company's accounts have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern basis. The following includes conditions give rise to substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date and management's plans to mitigate these adverse conditions:

The Company had an accumulated deficit of $136.62 million, negative net asset of $36 million and total liabilities of $122.02 million as of December 31, 2018. Assessing that the Company was not able to keep the size of lending business within one year from the financial statement issuance date, the Company established Zhiyuan and Zeshi in November 2018, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, including business factoring program, financing products design, related corporate financing solutions, investments and asset management, etc. as part of its restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2018, Zhiyuan disbursed loans of aggregating $64.7 million to four customers.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred operating loss of $94.13 million. Affected by the reduction of lending business and increased loans losses, the management was in the opinion that recurring operating losses would be made continue within one year from the financial statement issuance date. The Company continues to use its best effort to improve collection of loan receivable and interest receivable, which would result in reversal of provision for loan losses and recognition of interest income which was past due over 90 days and thus an increase in net profit.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred negative operating cash flow of $2.20 million. However with the establishment of Zhiyuan and Zeshi, through which the Company plans to launch new supply chain financing services in the near future, the management assessed the Company would have a positive operating cash flow within one year from the financial statement issuance date.

The Company has been actively seeking for strategic investors with experience in lending business as well as financial investors. On July 10, 2018, the Company closed a registered direct offering pursuant to a previously announced securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, raising approximately $1.69 million, net of issuance costs, from selling its ordinary shares at a price of $2.60 per share. The Company plans to continue to seek fund resources as well as strategic investors for additional financing.

Though management had plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statements issuance date, as there is no assurance that the liquidity plan will be successfully implemented. Failure to successfully implement the plan will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial position, and will materially adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern.

On January 16, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from Xinjiang superior people's court. China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd. sued the Company and its guarantors for a default on the loan, plus penalties. On September 18, 2018, Xinjiang Superior People's Court adjudicated that the Company shall repay the principal, interest and penalties owed to China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd, aggregating US$16.4 million. The Company is now in the process of appeal and is actively negotiating with China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd about the debt restructuring, but there is no agreement achieved as of the date of the announcement.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company was involved in five lawsuits with its loan customers for the aggregated claim of delinquent balances of $2.95 million, and in which the Company is a defendant. The amount which the Company is being sued for delinquent balances owned to two third parties is approximately $4.64 million.

As previously announced, on May 1, 2019, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirement of a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq also determined that the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing.

In according with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company submitted a draft plan to regain compliance and supplementary supporting materials. However, after reviewing the submission, Nasdaq has determined that the draft plan, together with the supporting materials, is not sufficiently definitive to evidence the Company's ability to achieve near term compliance with the continued listing requirements or sustain such compliance over an extended period of time.

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting determination. The hearing request has stayed the delisting action of the Company's securities by Nasdaq pending the Panel's final decision. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing.

The Company is doing everything within its control to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. If the Panel upholds the delisting determination following the hearing, the Company's securities may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Boards or in the ""pink sheets.""

(NASDAQ: CCIH) securities between April 10, 2015 and May 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). Investors have until August 12, 2019 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Click here to participate in the action.

The complaint, filed on June 12, 2019, alleges that on April 29, 2019 ChinaCache filed a Form NT 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it would delay filing its annual report for fiscal year 2018. On May 17, 2019, ChinaCache announced that the company and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (""Chairman""), Song Wang (""Wang""), were under criminal investigation by a government prosecutor office in Beijing for charges of enterprise bribery. Wang resigned as CEO and Chairman, and on that same day, ChinaCache securities were halted from trading on the NASDAQ.

Further, on May 23, 2019, ChinaCache said that it received a NASDAQ Notification Letter, three days earlier on May 20, 2019, because it failed NASDAQ listing requirements by delaying its 2018 Form NT 20-F (the ""NASDAQ Letter""). The NASDAQ Letter also probed the company regarding the resignation of its auditor, Grant Thornton China, ChinaCache's engagement of its new auditor, and the allegations of enterprise bribery by ChinaCache and Wang. To date, ChinaCache securities remain halted, and consequently ChinaCache securities are essentially valueless.

As a result of the transaction's close, Del Frisco's stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In conjunction with closing, L Catterton has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille assets to Landry's, Inc.

The remaining restaurant brands – bartaco and Barcelona Wine Bar – will operate as two separate businesses with distinct strategies and leadership teams under L Catterton's ownership.

""With more than 500 restaurants across the world, including a number of successful steak restaurants, Landry's leadership in hospitality and dining is widely established, making them an ideal owner of Del Frisco's steak business.""

Emmaus said it is committed to listing its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Emmaus warrants are expected to remain quoted on the OTC market.

Emmaus also said that the delisting of its common stock and warrants from The Nasdaq Stock Market is no way related to its current business operations or long-term growth plans.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.

(OTC: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today announced the withdrawal of its marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xyndari™ (glutamine) for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Xyndari was approved under the tradename Endari® (L-glutamine oral powder) by the FDA to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older, based on the results of a Phase 3 study and other supportive studies. Despite the results of the Phase 3 study and other data submitted to the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the CHMP maintains its initial opinion that the MAA did not demonstrate that Xyndari is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell disease crises or hospital visits.

""Because we have demonstrated the efficacy of Xyndari, as supported by the data from the trials conducted, we are disappointed in the CHMP's position,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We remain committed to the patients who suffer from sickle cell disease and will continue to endeavor to broaden our global patient base, while identifying new clinical uses for L-glutamine, obtaining additional patents and distribution partners, and through ongoing community and physician outreach. We are seriously considering a decentralized approval procedure on a country by country basis.""

Outside the United States, Xyndari is currently supplied through early access programs based on named patient use in a number of EU member states, Turkey and the Middle East. Xyndari received orphan designation by the European Commission in 2012 for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has also received an approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP) from the EMA.

The effective time of the merger was 6:00 P.M., Eastern time, today.

MYnd Analytics, formerly traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MYND,"" changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (""new"" Emmaus), and the privately owned Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. changed its name to EMI, Inc., and became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the ""new"" Emmaus. The ""new"" Emmaus common shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tomorrow, July 18, 2019, under the ticker symbol ""EMMA."" However, the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq remains subject to Nasdaq approval and the satisfaction of all initial listing requirements. In the interim, until further notice from Nasdaq, the common shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

As part of the merger, the former stockholders of Emmaus will receive approximately 1.05 shares of MYnd common stock for each share of common stock of Emmaus held prior to the merger. This exchange ratio gives effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the MYnd shares effected prior to the merger. Immediately after the merger, MYnd changed its name to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and the former stockholders and other equity holders of the merged entity owned 94.1% of Emmaus common stock on a fully diluted basis. The existing MYnd warrants will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""EMMAW""; however, Emmaus anticipates filing a Form 25 to voluntarily delist the warrants as they do not meet current Nasdaq listing standards. The delisting of the warrants would take place 10 days thereafter, at which time the warrants are expected to be eligible to trade OTC.

""We are entering the next stage in our evolution with the successful completion of the merger and the start of our journey as a Nasdaq-listed company,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""As a publicly traded company with greater access to the capital markets, Emmaus is in an excellent position to build upon our recent accomplishments in affording treatment to those around the world suffering from sickle cell disease and expand our platform to address additional clinical indications.

(Nasdaq: EMMA), a leader in sickle cell disease treatment, today reported significantly improved financial results at its EMI Holding, Inc. (EMI) subsidiary for the 2019 second quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2019. EMI is the company's principal operating subsidiary.

2019 Second Quarter Financial Results of EMI

Net revenues of EMI for the 2019 second quarter increased 128% to $5.9 million, up from $2.6 million for the same period last year, and 11% from the first quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by the continuing roll-out and market acceptance of Endari®, the first treatment approved by the FDA for sickle cell disease in nearly 20 years.

Total operating expenses equaled $6.3 million, compared with $5.1 million for the prior-year second quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling costs related to the marketing and continued commercialization of Endari, higher research and development costs associated with EMI's pilot/phase 1 diverticulosis study, and an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the commercialization of Endari and other business operations.

Operating loss for the 2019 second quarter was reduced substantially to $0.6 million, from $2.8 million last year.

""We have made substantial progress in the commercialization and roll-out of Endari, which is reflected in our 128% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and improved financial results. Additionally, our recent merger has considerably strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Emmaus to better access the capital markets to support our growth,"" said Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emmaus. ""We are continuing to broaden Endari's expansion throughout the global marketplace, while studying the use of the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari as a new treatment option for patients with diverticulosis and diabetes.""

2019 First-Half Financial Results

EMI's net revenues for the first six months of 2019 increased 233% to $11.2 million, up from $3.4 million for the same period last year.

Total operating expenses were $12.0 million, compared with $10.2 million for the prior-year first half.

About Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. Sickle cell disease is a significant unmet medical need, affecting approximately one hundred thousand patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. An estimated 1-in-365 African-American children are born with sickle cell disease.
