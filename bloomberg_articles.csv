A 17-year-old Israeli girl was killed in a terrorist attack near the West Bank settlement of Dolev, Israeli officials said. Her father and brother were also injured in the blast.
The attack Friday morning comes amid heightened tensions between Palestinians and Israelis in the lead up to Israel’s national elections next month, and against the backdrop of a broader financial dispute between the two sides that has left the Palestinian Authority struggling to pay employees.
The Israel Defense Forces said three Israeli civilians were hurt in the blast from an improvised explosive device while they were at a spring near Dolev, about 19 kilometers (12 miles) north of Jerusalem. Emergency services said the girl had died and two men, aged 46 and 20, were described as being in a serious condition.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed condolences to the family, while reiterating his government’s commitment to the settlements -- a key part of his campaign strategy ahead of the national poll on Sept. 17.
Israeli troops are blocking routes and boosting their presence in the area as officers assess the situation. Netanyahu said security forces are in pursuit of the “abhorrent terrorists.”
Tensions have been exacerbated in Israel this year as the financial plight of Palestinians worsened. The Israeli government began withholding about $11 million a month, or roughly 5% of what it collects in tax on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. Israel said the money was being used to pay stipends to families of Palestinians shot dead by Israeli security forces -- some after they had killed Israeli citizens -- or to families of those held in Israeli prisons.
Palestinian officials, who describe the payments as welfare for families of jailed relatives, had refused to accept any funds unless they received the taxes in full. But on Thursday, the PA said it would make a special salary payment to government staff after reaching an agreement with Israel that meant it had more to spend.
Attacks against Israelis have intensified in recent weeks. The daily Haaretz newspaper reported this week that security agencies were increasingly concerned over an outbreak of violence before Israel’s election.

Amid the escalation, both sides made preparations for the possibility of a broader confrontation. Israel moved troops closer to its southern border and declared closed military zones near Gaza. Reserves were called up, additional Iron Dome missile-defense batteries were deployed and bomb shelters were opened, including in Tel Aviv.
Television reports showed near-empty streets in southern Israeli communities. In Gaza, hospitals across the territory were put on an emergency footing.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Washington for a speech and meetings with President Donald Trump, called the initial strike, which injured seven people in a village 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Gaza, a “criminal attack on the state of Israel” and vowed to “respond forcefully.” Netanyahu initially was expected to cut his visit to Washington short, though it wasn’t clear later if he would follow through on that.
The conflict overshadowed Trump’s decision on Monday to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, reversing decades of U.S. policy with a presidential proclamation. A major military escalation could prove risky for Netanyahu, who is facing a tough re-election battle on April 9 amid a wide-ranging corruption scandal.
“It highlights an area that he’s perceived as not having delivered the results,” said Israel Democracy Institute President Yohanan Plesner. “The political impact of this Gaza escalation is also that it draws the attention away from the Trump recognition of the Golan Heights that was supposed to be an important moment in his campaign.”
If he stays in Washington, Netanyahu will likely address the annual America Israel Public Affairs Committee conference on Tuesday, as he was originally scheduled to do.
Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, late Monday night reported that the two sides had reached a cease-fire agreement through Egyptian mediation, although airstrikes and rocket fire continued. Netanyahu’s office, the Foreign Ministry and the Israeli army all declined to comment on the cease-fire claim, as they customarily do.
A damaged house after it was hit by a rocket north of Tel Aviv on March 25.
Attacks on Israel have escalated since Hamas suppressed recent protests against living conditions in the coastal enclave, which is groaning under Israeli and Egyptian blockades, sanctions imposed by the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, and Hamas taxes.
Weekly protests along the border with Israel have morphed into confrontations between soldiers and Hamas-led “nighttime confusion units,” backed by teams dispatching incendiary balloons. Three Palestinians were killed in confrontations last weekend in what Palestinians call the “Marches of Return,” which are approaching their one-year anniversary this weekend.
None of the militant groups in Gaza claimed responsibility for Monday morning’s rocket attack, saying it had been an accident -- the same explanation given for a March 14 attack near Tel Aviv that caused no injuries or damage. The attacks challenge Netanyahu’s reputation as the guardian of Israel’s security just as he faces a challenge at the polls from a center-left bloc led by former Army chief Benny Gantz.
“I have a simple message to Israel’s enemies: We will do whatever we must do to defend our people and defend our state,” Netanyahu said at a news conference with Trump at the White House, saying he would “lead the people of Israel and the soldiers of Israel.”
Israel’s army said its targets included a secret Hamas intelligence headquarters that was one of the group’s “central assets,” as well as the office of Hamas Chairman Ismail Haniyeh, who vowed that “our people won’t surrender.” Gaza health officials reported seven people were injured in the wave of attacks.
The rocket fire interrupted a U.S. trip Netanyahu hoped would bolster an election campaign tarnished by his recent entanglement in a naval acquisition bribery scandal. The prime minister, who is likely to be indicted in three other corruption cases, has not been a suspect in the case, but Israeli media say prosecutors are weighing investigating him after learning Netanyahu once held shares in a company that supplied German shipbuilder Thyssenkrupp AG. Netanyahu says he sold the shares in 2010, long before the sub order, and is innocent of any wrongdoing.
Some polls have shown Netanyahu’s Likud party slipping since the reports emerged, but his current coalition of right-wing and religious parties still would have an advantage over Gantz’s bloc. Gantz, addressing AIPAC on Monday, staked out hardline security positions similar to Netanyahu’s, while calling for domestic unity.
“The reality in the south, as we unfortunately saw today, where Israeli children spend their nights in bomb shelters while the heads of Hamas celebrate, must end now,” Gantz said. He also swiped at Netanyahu, saying “divisive dialogue” is tearing Israel apart, and pledged that a government he leads would have no corruption.

A festival of concerts and fireworks for the kingdom’s national day has taken on greater importance.
Less than a week after an attack on its largest oil refinery exposed Saudi Arabia’s weakness, the country will erupt in celebration for a holiday to showcase its strength.
The kingdom’s 89th National Day, replete with five days of fireworks, has taken on new significance this year for Saudis. It already was supposed to be the biggest ever extravaganza after a year of international pressure on leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Then came last weekend’s drone strikes on one of the world’s biggest spenders on defense. 
For Saudis strolling along Riyadh’s Tahlia Street, the celebrations, planned months in advance, are an occasion to show defiance in the face of the most serious violation of Saudi sovereignty in decades.
“It’s important to celebrate our national day to reinforce our love for our country and to show the enemy we’re not scared and it won’t affect us,” said Amal al-Mutairi, a 24-year-old student who wore a pin with pictures of Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman, on her black abaya cloak.

Nearby, Saudis gathered to watch traditional dances performed to rhythmic music and children hoisted on their dad’s shoulders waved the kingdom’s flag. Patisseries sold cakes dyed in the flag’s green color and shops offered special discounts for the occasion.
Entertainment company Cirque du Soleil will perform in the Eastern Province at a location an hour’s drive from the site of the unprecedented Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabia’s energy industry. Concerts, street festivals and art and craft workshops will be held across the kingdom under the slogan “Himma Hatta al-Qimma,” which roughly means “Strength Until the End.”
The theme of the events for the Sept. 23 National Day was inspired by Prince Mohammed’s words last year in which he compared his people’s strength to the country’s Twaiq Mountain, said Amr Banaja, chief executive officer of the General Entertainment Authority, which is organizing the events.
“The aspirations of Saudis will never break just like this mountain won't,” Banaja said in an interview on Thursday before the festivities kicked off. “So nothing will stop us.”
Saudi Arabia has been stepping up a  public relations campaign both at home and abroad. Its reputation in the U.S. and other countries has been battered by the war in Yemen, the detention of female activists and the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October.
The U.S. Congress has condemned the Saudis over the Khashoggi murder and the Yemen military campaign.
Saudi and U.S. officials have said the drones and missiles used in the refinery strike last week were made by Iran, had never before been deployed by Iranian proxy groups and came from a northerly direction, ruling out Yemen as a launch site.
But they stopped short of saying the strikes were  launched directly from or by the Islamic Republic, claims that could have propelled a drift toward war. The attacks caused an unprecedented surge in oil prices.
“The impact of the attack against the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure will be felt long after the physical damage has been repaired and key infrastructure reconstructed,” Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at political risk company Verisk Maplecroft, said in a report. “Most importantly, the attacks have highlighted a vulnerability that cannot be easily or quickly remedied.”

"In a sea of electric concepts and far-off prototypes, a shift in tone may indicate the supers have jumped the shark. 
In a sea of electric concepts and far-off prototypes, a shift in tone may indicate the supers have jumped the shark. 
Pininfarina promises its Battista supercar will come with 1,900 horsepower, zero emissions, and an all-electric range of 280 miles. 
At the Frankfurt Auto Show this month, Lamborghini will unveil a V12 hybrid supercar called the Siån.
The Bologna, Italy-based brand will make 63 of them, all already spoken for.
Lamborghini had hinted at its importance publicly in recent months and described in past detail how such special projects form an integral part of the business. Though unconfirmed, early reports set the price of the car around $3 million—an astronomical though increasingly common amount.  
“The  Reventon prompted the big discussion about the dimensions of this segment,” Maurizio Reggiani, Lamborgini’s chief engineer, told Bloomberg Pursuits during an interview in his office at company headquarters, noting that Lamborghini “started” the segment with its Lamborghini Reventon in 2007. “We were the first to do it like this. As we scouted more and more during that time, we started to see how, in this market, you can stretch in terms of price and in terms of demand. The Reventon coupe was $3 million; the [Reventon] roadster was $3.2 million; the Centenario was $2 million. So in this segment, we know there is a marvelous market.”
The mid-engine V12, all-wheel-drive Reventon famously hit 220mph on a test in Dubai, an astounding figure for a production car at that time. Only 20 were made, plus one marked for the Lamborghini museum. 
Should it happen, the new hybrid will join a burgeoning field of extremely limited-edition hybrid and electric supercars from such luxury powerhouses as Aston Martin, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Lotus, Mercedes-Benz, and Pininfarina. They have been flaunted recently in dazzling hues on golf courses and during private parties at seaside villas, heralded on Instagram fanboy accounts and Rodeo Drive parades orchestrated for YouTube.
Where it used to be that a company would have only one ever, or at most, one per year, now it seems they’re whipping them up as fast as possible. In the past year, Aston Martin alone has debuted and promised supercars in spades: the super-lightweight 1,160-horsepower Valkyrie and the 986 hp Valhalla hybrids, plus a Vanquish Vision concept and Valkyrie AMR Pro concept, not to mention the electric offerings from its Lagonda department. They follow the precedent from the One-77 and Vulcan supercars that came in the years before. It’s quite a different mood for what used to be a staid, small automaker tucked into the verdant hills of England’s Cotswolds region.
Many supercars, such as the $2.72 million Mercedes-AMG Project One limited-to-275 hybrid supercar based on Mercedes’s Formula 1 car, are sold as concepts, or very rough prototypes, and require six- or seven-figure deposits years in advance to ensure delivery. Others are sold with even less—a few sketches, a rendering, a foam-filled shell at an auto show. That’s if you can even get on the list to buy one. The official party line for most, like the Lambo, is that they have sold out before they’re even seen.
Some collectors are starting to find the rigmarole rather tedious.
“We need an awakening and cleansing soon to get everyone back into reality,” says Dan Kang, the well-known car collector based in Southern California, who owns a McLaren Senna, a Guntherwerks Porsche 911, and Lamborghini Centenario in similar carbon fiber livery, among other supercars. “It’s not even the new companies, but the current heritage brands as well, who feel they can demand the new price points without much substance. They need to support what they have already sold—not what [car] they can shovel up next.”
When manufacturers are unveiling cars that can’t be driven for years to come, and the very people able to afford them are over the hype anyway, it raises the question: Have we reached peak supercar?
Modern supercars, and their higher-end cousins, hypercars—both relative terms defined largely by whom you ask—are latecomers to the thread of automotive history. First, there were the rockets of their time, such as the Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows of the 1930s and 300SL Gullwings of the 1950s. In the 1960s, the Ferrari 250 GTOs dominated countless races and reached automotive immortality as the ultimate auction house blue-chip buys. But the supercar as we know it really came into its own in the late 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s, when hedonism reigned supreme. Such early examples as the Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari F40 set major precedents for design and performance. They were like space ships, compared the mundane and affordable metal boxes of the day. Everyone has a favorite; just ask the guys down at the weekend coffee klatch about the Vector, the Ferrari Enzo, or the Porsche Carrera GT. You’ll get a reaction.
They were duly expensive. A Countach sold for $72,000 at the time, or the equivalent of $375,000 today; the F40 cost $400,000, or the equivalent of $884,000 today.
Supercars tend to age well if you have the patience, luck, and financing to get your hands on one: On Aug. 16 in Monterey, Calif., a 1994 McLaren F1 sold for $19.8 million, obliterating the previous high-price paid for a McLaren: $13.75 million in 2015. (Its original MSRP was  around $1 million.) You won’t be surprised to learn that the man who designed that car, Gordon Murray, is now designing a round of 100 new supercars tentatively called the T50 and priced near $3 million.
The role of the supercar used to be to act as the halo for the brand, to attract media attention and consumer hype to a marque. Even if only a few people could afford to actually buy the exciting, sexy car, they’d know about the brand because of it and then buy something more affordable. Automakers figured that if you loved, or at least knew about, the  Acura NSX that Formula 1 champion Aryton Senna helped develop, you’d be more likely to buy an Accord. It seems a stretch—but the basic awareness of a brand is half the battle, marketers say. And an NSX is a lot more likely to grab headlines than an Accord is.
Supercars also carried the advanced driving technologies consumers could expect to see seep into the rest of the product lineup in succeeding years. The SF90 Stradale that Ferrari debuted in May is the first plug-in hybrid in Ferrari’s history, with a 679-horsepower twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 paired to the brand’s first-ever hybrid motor. Its gasoline engine and trio of electric motors combined make it the most powerful Ferrari ever, totaling 968 horsepower.
In fact, the SF90 is the latest in an onslaught of supercars that has taken a slightly different tone.
Supercars are increasingly electric, rather than powered by the galloping V12 and W16 engines of old. The Aston Martin Valkyrie,  Koenigsegg Jesko,  Lotus Evija, Mercedes-Benz Project One, and  Pininfarina Battista, among others, all use electric motors to help boost them to ever-higher (at least in theory) feats of speed and strength. They all have yet to hit the market in production form.
They’re coming from all sides of the market, too: such big, old heritage brands as Lamborghini and Ferrari, of course, but also from namesake novelty brands such as Gordon Murray Automotive and just-minted startups dotting the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Korea, Japan and China. These boutiques tend to have obscure names and opaque origins, blending the lines among automotive companies, tech companies, and software startups. Witness the British Dendrobium D1 and Ariel P40, the Chinese XING Mobility Miss E, the Croatian Rimac Concept_One, and the Japanese Aspark Owl. They come and go in the automotive consciousness, many making a splash at a car show with a foam mold or rendering, trotting that same car around for a year or two, then quietly merging with a larger auto or tech company, or shutting down altogether.
Rather than loss-leaders for the brand, they’re now a big part of the business model—or the business model.
“Basically, [the deposits to the supercar startups are] seed money to get operations up and running—applied to the cost of the car,” says Kevin Tynan, senior automotive analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of it as venture capital, with the return being a supercar instead of a percentage.”
In November, Lamborghini announced the one-off Lamborghini SC18 Alston, created for a single customer at a multimillion-dollar cost. 
It was a strategy that took cues from the Lamborghini Reventon: When it debuted, its almost immediate sell-out success of all 20 models to Middle Eastern sheiks and Russian billionaires proved to Lamborghini brass that the market could handle the extravagant price and exclusivity of vehicles heretofore considered too wild for it to bear. This paved the way for the $4.5 million Veneno and the aforementioned, 759-horsepower Centenario, rare-as-plutonium supercars that came several years later.
Reggiani characterized the one-offs as a not-insignificant part of Lamborghini’s bottom line, though he declined to give a percentage.
Elsewhere, Ferrari, which announced a Special Projects Division 10 years ago, has built one-off cars such as the Superamerica 45 and the P540 Superfast Aperta. Aston Martin has quietly made such one-offs as the CC100 and Valkyrie hybrid; McLaren made the 1,035-hp hybrid Speedtail.
“The sky is the limit,” Bugatti chief Stephan Winkelmann said this summer at the Villa d’Este Concours d’Elegance. The company had just unveiled the La Voiture Noir car purchased by Ferdinand Piëch, the notorious Volksagen boss who died Aug 25. The car cost nearly $19 million, after taxes and fees.
Proponents, and corporate press materials, rave about the shocking designs and extensive technologies of these extreme supercars, but their proliferation has simultaneously spurred the customary cadre of critics. Those skeptics—or, maybe, prophets—point to a whole lot of empty promises from the automakers and question their connection to reality, whether now or later.
There’s no question that in the future the world is going to have to change. Consumers will have to find sustainable transportation, says Jim Glickenhaus, who makes road-legal hypercars and supercars of his own. But he notes that his wife’s Tesla S is already much faster than she could ever drive it on public roads, both legally and logistically.
“Where are you going to drive a 2,000-horsepower electric supercar? You’ll run out of road,” he says. “I already get a headache in the Tesla! And now we’re getting 2,000-horsepower hyper-electric cars? Seriously. Why you would ever need a 2000-horsepower electric hypercar? I just don’t understand. You’re never going to drive a hypercar to pick up groceries.”
Not that any of the people who currently own the few electric hypercars that have actually come to market ever go grocery shopping; the idea is that there is a finite and very small market for that type of car at all, and we are near reaching the saturation point. Call it hypercar fatigue, contagious only among those who have been buying the hypercars in the first place.
Many of the new supercars are not legal to bring into the United States under normal permitting, anyway. They’re legal only to “show and display,” not to drive on public roads, because they don’t meet federal safety and emissions regulations. The Ferrari Icona Series Monza SP1 and SP2 cars, for instance, are legal for track use only.
Not that it matters. Follow Kang on Instagram or Mattress King collector Michael Fux for any length of time, and you’ll see they drive their more-practical Porsches and Rolls-Royces more than the hypercars they hoard. (Fux recently pulled up to Manhattan's Cipriani restaurant in his white Rolls, for instance, rather than his green Senna.) Peruse the auction catalogues of any major sale, browse through the feed of wealthy Youtube go-getters, or ask the young scions of Saudi families: They’re all bragging about how few miles their supercar has on the odometer, not about the great drive they took up the coast, say. 
The popular thing for younger, newer collectors seems to be not driving your car, instead of driving it—a drastic change from the longstanding tradition of the best, most hallowed cars earning their stripes by taking epic drives, winning adventure races, and parading through Paris.
“This whole modern supercar-hypercar market is destined to collapse under its own weight and implode on itself,” says Winston Goodfellow, an automotive author and analyst who judged the  Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance last month. “After all, if the things aren’t being utilized for their original purpose, there are only so many suckers and cult members out there who will agree that this weird Kool Aid actually tastes good and makes sense to drink.”
There are other cracks in the proverbial armor. Mercedes-AMG has yet to deliver any of the Project One cars it promised nearly three years ago. (Deliveries are set for 2021, according to a Mercedes spokesman.) So does Ariel, with the P40 it announced in 2017; Aspark, with the undelivered Owls it announced in 2018; and XING, with the Miss R it announced in 2017. Dendrobium, which announced the D1 last year and has said it would be ready by 2022, is already pointing to Brexit as a reason why it may not be able to deliver on its promises.
“So many investors have said to us that they’re keen but need some resolution one way or another,” Dendrobium boss Nigel Gordon-Stewart told Top Gear. 
Indeed. Read through the fine lines of press releases about the new supercars and you’ll see phrases like “working toward being fully funded” and “working to develop a technology partner,” verbal cues that the company is far from anywhere near being able to make production cars. Faraday Future unveiled an electric hypercar concept called the FFZERO1 in 2016 without even having a factory—or the money to build one. It has yet to produce any cars.
Then there’s the fact that the values of the first supercars are slumping. The McLaren F1 that sold in Monterey set a record—but failed to match even the low end of its estimated value before the sale. At the Gooding & Co. auctions in Arizona earlier this year, a 1990 Countach failed to reach even its low value estimate of $275,000; so did a Ferrari Testarossa listed for $250,000-$300,000 that sold for (just) $221,200. 
The automakers themselves remain notoriously cagey about exactly how supercar sales have been faring. Many blast instant- or near-immediate sell-out numbers in press releases, while other—when asked privately and perhaps more transparently—say that roughly half sold very early, and the rest are expected to sell in the coming weeks. Bugatti, one of the more forthcoming of the lot, has said that this applies to its Centodieci. It famously had to sell only one of the La Voiture Noire cars, anyway the one that went to Piech.  
It’s telling, if anecdotal, that public sentiment may be shifting. Locals near one of the biggest annual supercar gatherings in the world—on Cannery Row in Monterey during car week—even succeeded in getting it canceled this year amid complaints of noise and general disruption. Please don’t “hoon” around in your Lamborghini, one Instagram user requested.  
It was a blow to the automotive “influencers” who are the prime targets for the hypercars—to their egos, at least. After all, if you can’t show off your supercar on social media, is it even really yours, bro?
“The pendulum has already started to swing. It’s just that people don’t notice it because all these manufacturers are flooding the market with new product and obfuscating the view,” says Goodfellow. “When you have companies selling things that can’t even be driven on the street—and no one thinks this is weird—there is real distortion.”

Major chain stores including Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s have all recently reported healthy sales numbers, showing that Americans are confident enough to tune out trade wars, literal wars, global economic fragility, angry presidential tweets, the disappointing end to “Games of Thrones” and other problems. 
Sarah Halzack writes that Target Corp. is capitalizing on people’s propensity to spend by introducing appealing in-house brands of apparel and food, and by stressing store pickups of merchandise ordered online. As long as retailers deliver what shoppers want, Sarah says, nothing seems to stop Americans’ red, white and blue shopping carts full of stuff — at least for now. 
Conor Sen also finds proof of the strong U.S. consumer economy in the form of a chicken sandwich that has set off a social media frenzy. 
Good economic times tend to be when fast-food restaurants come out with an iconic menu item— in a stealth effort to raise prices and offset rising costs. The Big Mac and the Whopper debuted during times of low unemployment. Now, Conor says, the Popeyes $3.99 chicken sandwich and plant-based burgers on offer at other fast-food chains are signs that restaurants believe people are feeling good enough to embrace better menu items at premium prices. Economic health can’t last forever, but fried chicken on a brioche bun may endure. 
You know what isn’t great for a retailer? Walmart Inc. this week sued Tesla Inc. over claims that the electric car maker’s solar panel business — created after its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity — botched installations at Walmart stores and sparked several electrical fires on store roofs. (Tesla’s lawyer blamed Walmart for “breaches of contract” and “bad faith.”) The Walmart litigation, Liam Denning says, “adds to the sense that SolarCity was a deal that Tesla didn’t need and which has  ultimately burdened its resources and now maybe its reputation, too.”
Poverty or economic inequality are widely seen as the reasons for resentments flaring up in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir, and in Hong Kong. But economic grievances are not the primary force behind discontent in either place, Mihir Sharma writes. The deeper issue is identity, and protesters are worried about distant central governments paring back what little autonomy citizens have. These trends are evident from Britain to Ohio and beyond, Mihir writes. 
How would you like to loan someone $100 for 30 years, and after those decades you get less than $100 back? It sounds about as appealing as a root canal. But investors are so anxious about economic conditions, they’re willing to park money in safe government bonds, even if it means earning no interest. 
Fear, however, does have its limits. Germany didn’t have as many takers as it expected for a sale of government bonds that offered zero interest payments. Marcus Ashworth says these German bonds were a step too far, but this is hardly the end of negative-yielding debt. “This is the new normal,” Marcus declares, especially with the European Central Bank poised to buy debt in a bid to stem economic weakness.

Nothing can stop Americans from buying cartloads of stuff, or splurging on fast food. 
Americans are buying stuff! 
The world is a chaotic mess, but apparently there are no problems that shopping and fast food can’t solve. 
Major chain stores including Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s have all recently reported healthy sales numbers, showing that Americans are confident enough to tune out trade wars, literal wars, global economic fragility, angry presidential tweets, the disappointing end to “Game of Thrones” and other problems. 
Sarah Halzack writes that Target Corp. is capitalizing on people’s propensity to spend by introducing appealing in-house brands of apparel and food, and by stressing store pickups of merchandise ordered online. As long as retailers deliver what shoppers want, Sarah says, nothing seems to stop Americans’ red, white and blue shopping carts full of stuff — at least for now. 
Conor Sen also finds proof of the strong U.S. consumer economy in the form of a chicken sandwich that has set off a social media frenzy. 
Good economic times tend to be when fast-food restaurants come out with an iconic menu item— in a stealth effort to raise prices and offset rising costs. The Big Mac and the Whopper debuted during times of low unemployment. Now, Conor says, the Popeyes $3.99 chicken sandwich and plant-based burgers on offer at other fast-food chains are signs that restaurants believe people are feeling good enough to embrace better menu items at premium prices. Economic health can’t last forever, but fried chicken on a brioche bun may endure. 
You know what isn’t great for a retailer? Walmart Inc. this week sued Tesla Inc. over claims that the electric car maker’s solar panel business — created after its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity — botched installations at Walmart stores and sparked several electrical fires on store roofs. (Tesla’s lawyer blamed Walmart for “breaches of contract” and “bad faith.”) The Walmart litigation, Liam Denning says, “adds to the sense that SolarCity was a deal that Tesla didn’t need and which has  ultimately burdened its resources and now maybe its reputation, too.”
Poverty or economic inequality are widely seen as the reasons for resentments flaring up in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir, and in Hong Kong. But economic grievances are not the primary force behind discontent in either place, Mihir Sharma writes. The deeper issue is identity, and protesters are worried about distant central governments paring back what little autonomy citizens have. These trends are evident from Britain to Ohio and beyond, Mihir writes. 
How would you like to loan someone $100 for 30 years, and after those decades you get less than $100 back? It sounds about as appealing as a root canal. But investors are so anxious about economic conditions, they’re willing to park money in safe government bonds, even if it means earning no interest. 
Fear, however, does have its limits. Germany didn’t have as many takers as it expected for a sale of government bonds that offered zero interest payments. Marcus Ashworth says these German bonds were a step too far, but this is hardly the end of negative-yielding debt. “This is the new normal,” Marcus declares, especially with the European Central Bank poised to buy debt in a bid to stem economic weakness.

After two mass shootings within 24 hours earlier this month, President Trump backed “very meaningful” background checks for firearm purchases. Predictably, he then retreated, despite wide popular support for comprehensive background checks. 
Bloomberg’s editorial board throws cold water on Trump’s claims that the U.S. already has strong background checks, and says he is misguided in blaming mass gun deaths on a “mental health problem.” The editorial board says the president’s initial words show that even with Trump’s strong ties to the gun lobby, he  feels the political pressure to do the right thing. More pressure might actually bring long overdue change, the editorial board writes. 
It also took Trump less than 24 hours to backtrack on a couple of tax-cut ideas. On Tuesday, he suggested his administration was considering paring a payroll tax paid by American workers and their employers to fund Social Security and Medicare. On Wednesday, Trump said he is “not looking at a tax cut now.” 
Before this presidential flip-flop, Tyler Cowen wrote that economic theory suggests wages would adjust to a relatively small reduction in payroll taxes, and therefore employees wouldn’t see raises on a tax-adjusted basis. Politically, a temporary payroll tax could benefit  both the president and his opponents, Karl W. Smith said, by taking the issue off the table until after the 2022 midterm elections.

It was always going to be a tough sell. The world's first 30-year bond offering a zero coupon got a lukewarm response from investors today, falling well below Germany's target sales of €2 billion. Weak orders suggests negative yields across Europe may finally be taking their toll on investor demand. Here's a look at what was expected.
Boris Johnson wants to rally support for former Finance Minister George Osborne to become the next head of the IMF, a person familiar said. Johnson will use the G-7 meetings in Biarritz, France, this weekend to urge President Trump and other world leaders to support a U.K. bid for Osborne. A Briton has never run the IMF, and the new government may see it as a way to maintain its standing on the world stage after Brexit.
Italy's opposition is striving to avert an election and stop the League party from governing alone. A coalition between the Five Star Movement and the Democrats is emerging as an option after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte quit yesterday. President Mattarella has the sole power to appoint governments and call elections. ""It is now our turn to move and show the way ahead,"" Democrats leader Nicola Zingaretti said.
Ryanair's bid to block a strike by Irish pilots was upheld by a court in Dublin, while a hearing in London will determine whether U.K. crews can walk out ahead of the bank holiday—the busiest weekend for air travel. Members of the British Airline Pilots' Association and Ireland's Forsa are seeking a raise and the U.K. union had accused Ryanair of resorting to ""bullying tactics"" by taking the dispute to court.
Hong Kong protesters will rally tonight for the release of U.K. consulate worker Simon Cheng, who was detained on a visit to mainland China, as near-daily demonstrations continue. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam will meet up to 30 people Saturday to discuss a platform for dialogue, RTHK reported. The pressure is on as concern mounts that China will want the city calm before its 70th birthday celebrations on Oct. 1. Here's a guide about why the protests are continuing.

A breakdown in communication may be cited as a reason for a lack of understanding among regulators about key design elements on the Boeing 737 Max until the first of the two crashes, a person familiar said. The safety feature that forced down the nose of the jets evolved during development and the changes weren't always flagged adequately.
Markets may be overreacting to other political events around the globe, but they're underreacting to those in Italy, John Authers writes for Bloomberg Opinion. In 2017, the prospect of Marine Le Pen—a very similar politician to Matteo Salvini—gaining the French presidency was enough to frighten investors to the core. Salvini's chances of taking power in Italy now look much higher than Le Pen's did then; the only alternative appears to be a dreadful mess.
It took the threat of a recession at home to get Germany to promise fiscal stimulus, but that isn't how the euro zone is meant to work, Ferdinando Giugliano writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Without a centralized pot of money, stronger countries like Germany should have acted much earlier to boost their own demand to help fellow members.
If Egypt is the Middle East's best-performing economy, why are more and more Egyptians becoming poorer, Amr Adly asks in Bloomberg Opinion. Instead of focusing primarily on GDP growth, international lenders should care more about where that growth occurs, and how it's redistributed through state expenditure and revenues so that more people reap the rewards.   
Zimbabwe's rulers are in a trap of their own making. If they implement the political and democratic reforms needed to win financial support from international donors, they're likely to lose the next election. If they don't, their people, propelled by extreme hardship, may remove them through an uprising.
While electric cars are a realistic alternative to the century-old internal-combustion engine, the world's waterways are dominated by ships that belch plumes of diesel exhaust and heavy fuel oil. Because of long life cycles and a shortage of charging infrastructure and advanced batteries, converting ships is difficult. That hasn't stopped governments from Norway to Thailand insisting on a greener future. We take a look a look at the state of electric cruisers.

Denmark's Queen Margrethe II has expressed her surprise at Donald Trump's decision to call off his state visit, following his unsuccessful attempt to acquire Greenland. A leading member of the Danish government was rather less diplomatic, calling Trump's behavior ""hopeless,"" while a former prime minister said the snub was ""deeply insulting"" and asked whether the whole exercise had been a joke.
In a victory for German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, Angela Merkel's cabinet agreed to abolish a tax that was used to help finance reunification for all but the very wealthy. Scholz won the day after standing firm against demands from some in Merkel's Christian Democratic party to abolish the so-called solidarity surcharge completely. By 2021, the tax will be eliminated for 90% of those currently paying it and another 6.5% will receive partial relief.
One sporting event is going gender neutral. In a first for a major federation, the Women's Rugby World Cup is dropping the ""women's"" to simply be called the Rugby World Cup 2021 ahead of the tournament in New Zealand. World Rugby hopes to raise the profile of the women's game and get rid of any bias toward the men's competitions, which don't specify gender."

The stock closed 31% higher at 8.48 Egyptian pounds, after shares were sold at 6.46 pounds in the IPO. The offering represented 36% of Fawry’s share capital and raised about 1.6 billion pounds ($97 million). EFG Hermes Holding managed the sale.
Fawry is an 11-year-old company that facilitates electronic bill-payments in urban neighborhoods, and counts 20 million Egyptians as customers, according to its website. Its retail network includes grocers and pharmacies. A tranche of the IPO offered to institutional investors was oversubscribed by 15.9 times, according to EFG Hermes.
Fawry is the first IPO on the EGX since Sarwa Capital in October 2018, as high interest rates attract investors to fixed income rather than equities. The government has delayed plans to offer stakes in some state-run companies, sales that were supposed to streamline the bloated public sector and turn around loss-making enterprises.
Following the “good reception” of the IPO, the stock will likely outperform within its first month of trading, said Amr Elalfy, the head of research at SHUAA Securities Egypt. More than 80% of subscribers were Egyptians, according to data from the bourse.
A stock stabilization fund managed by EFG Hermes will help sustain the stock price in the first month of trading. This measure “should support the stock holders from the public offering,” Elalfy said earlier this week. Potential risks to the stock’s performance include low liquidity, revenue and growth rates that fail to meet market expectations and weakening margins, he said.
The company has “exceptional growth potential,” said Allen Sandeep, director of research at Naeem Holding in Cairo. That contrasts with most companies in the same sector in emerging markets that are making losses, he said.

8	AMR	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-01/growing-pains-at-aston-martin-as-it-goes-electric	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-01/growing-pains-at-aston-martin-as-it-goes-electric	May 1, 2019, 11:19 AM EDT	At Aston Martin, Facing Down Demons and Building for the Future	"The 106-year-old automaker is working hard to beat a few imposing obstacles, from a limp IPO to historically low production volume.
The 106-year-old automaker is working hard to beat a few imposing obstacles, from a limp IPO to historically low production volume.
Aston Martin officially debuted the electric Rapide E last month at the Shanghai Auto Show—nearly four years after its initial announcement about the car.
Based on the V12-powered Rapide, the sedan will arrive in one small batch, with a scant 155 “special edition” cars produced. But contrary to widespread speculation, it won’t star in the upcoming 25th installment of the James Bond franchise.
It would have been a somewhat unexpected product placement anyway, considering Bond’s image as a well-dressed rule-breaker, rather than a well-dressed environmentalist. And Great Britain’s 106-year-old company has plenty of bigger problems that even Bond himself wouldn’t be able to fix.
When Deutsche Bank revised its outlook for Aston Martin on April 8 to a more negative view, its shares plummeted, finally settling down by market’s close at half of October’s initial public offering price of  19 pounds ($24.70). That figure  gave the company a market capitalization of 4.1 billion pounds. Analysts cited “higher volatility in demand” and “limited share price potential” as factors leading to the downgrade. (The company had announced a $190 million note issue to generate more funds April 3.)
Last year’s IPO fell completely  flat, and uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the general cooling of the automotive market has done much to shake investor confidence in the iconic English marque. Aston Martin is currently worth less than one-fifth the value of its rival Ferrari, a company Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer had said his brand’s own value would exceed when it made its debut as a public company.  
“We’ve taken 105 years to get to an IPO. We’re not going to worry much on what the initial shares are doing,” Palmer said in an interview with Bloomberg TV after it went public. “We will always look over the longer term.”
One challenge Aston must face is its historically low production numbers. Last year the brand sold fewer than 6,500 vehicles worldwide, far less than even Porsche, let alone BMW or Mercedes-Benz. That exclusivity has always been part of the brand’s cachet, but to increasingly diminishing returns. In this day and age, when trucks and SUVs reign supreme, car companies must sell lots of vehicles to stay afloat. Even arch-rival Ferrari has announced plans to make an SUV. 
Meanwhile, Aston Martin has been forced to give deep dealer incentives to jump-start sales of its new Vantage, a $150,000 coupe. The success of that car is crucial to overall corporate health, since as the lower-priced, lower-powered Aston Martin, it was intended to be its biggest seller. And although Aston Martin will report its best Q1 ever for North America this year, the IPO resulted in a pretax loss of £68 million ($89 million) for 2018.
“They haven’t had the right product cadence yet,” says Kevin Tynan, the lead automotive analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “If anything they’ve been a little quiet while all of this news is happening around them. If you were a conspiracy theorist, you’d be worried about [where they are getting] funding.”  
Of course, Tynan notes, quiet doesn’t necessarily mean inactive. If you look carefully, Aston Martin is fighting its demons using the good old-fashioned multi-pronged approach.
Kris Singh is a young investor from Miami who spends millions of dollars at auto shows each year buying whatever he wants.
What he wants lately are hybrid supercars.
At the Geneva Motor Show in March, Singh reserved for himself the Aston Martin AM-RB 003, a $2 million hybrid that will start production in 2021. The hypercar was among the most-feted debuts at the year’s most exciting show, but it’s far from Aston Martin’s first million-dollar hybrid. The $3 million Valkyrie, which runs on a V12 engine paired with a lightweight electric motor, sold out almost instantly when it debuted in 2017, even though it will be later this year before its buyers can take it home.
Creating a halo around an electrified supercar is mandatory these days if you want to be like Ferrari. McLaren, Ferrari, Porsche, Pininfarina, and Mercedes-Benz all already make and sell—for very high margins—hybrid or all-electric supercars like the Pininfarina Battista and Ferrari LaFerrari.
Aston Martin declined to comment on the specific margins the company makes on such cars but a spokesperson did note that “specials” like the AM-RB 003 and the Aston Martin Valkyrie have a “significant impact” on the company’s average selling price. In 2018, the average selling price per vehicle at Aston Martin was £141,000 ($184,460) excluding special cars. It was £157,000 ($205,390) including them. 
Plus, with a decades-long Formula 1 and endurance racing heritage bolstering the credentials of some of the best-driving sports cars on the market, the car highlights one area where the brand can excel, Tynan says, even if it is in extremely low volumes. The company will make fewer than 500 of them for worldwide distribution. 
“Honestly my opinion is that Aston Martin is in a pretty good spot in terms of this whole hypercar and electrification thing,” he says. “People still want their hypercars. They want performance, and they’re willing to pay for it. Aston Martin won’t have to change who they are to fit into the evolution of what’s going on with the industry.”
With their instant torque and less-demanding range demands, it’s no accident that the Valkyrie and AM-RB 003 were Aston Martin’s first major electric-boosted endeavors to get legs. Their intergalactic body styles and high level of customization provide lightning-rod excitement for the brand, while the technology inside them will trickle down to more affordable wares, all of which will be available in hybrid or pure-electric form by 2025, Palmer said. 
Indeed, real-world electric driving performance is where Aston Martin can gain more market foothold. By the end of this year, global sales of electric vehicles will hit 2 million, up from 1.2 million in 2017, according to Frost & Sullivan’s Global Electric Vehicle Market Outlook 2018 report.
Though it’s trotting out the all-electric Rapide E at auto shows, the brand is far behind the rest of the pack. Tesla continues to steer the market segment for premium sedans and SUVs with its waiting-list-only Models S, 3 and X. Porsche will be selling the much-anticipated Taycan sedan by November. Audi and Jaguar are already selling excellent electric SUVs; BMW and Mercedes-Benz will be selling their own later this year.
What’s more, the race is intensifying. Porsche has said half of its vehicles will be electric by 2023, and BMW says it will do 25 electrified vehicles by 2025. To have a chance of keeping up, Aston Martin must show that it can make reliable daily drivers just as well as it makes track stars—those, ultimately, are where the bread-and-butter profits will derive. 
“There are plenty of customers who are high net worth and for whom sustainability is important,” says Ian Fletcher, the principal analyst at IHS Market, an automotive research firm. “Does Aston need to have something more than an electric Rapide E? Of course. But they’re moving forward with their [long-term] strategy, and at the end of the day, they just need to keep pedaling.”  
The brand is also aiming to launch a top-tier SUV to compete with the Porsche Cayenne and Macan, the Bentley Bentayga, and the Lamborghini Urus. It’s a tactic that’s worked for Bentley, which has doubled production numbers with its new Bentayga, and for Porsche, whose $50,000 Macan is the company’s best-selling vehicle. Scheduled for its official unveiling by the end of 2019, with sales in 2020, the DBX is intended to do the same kind of heavy lifting—Aston wants to double its total production by 2023, Palmer said, when the company will make 14,000 total vehicles worldwide.
“I think [DBX] bodes well for the brand,” says Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst for IHS Markit. “Aston Martin is a brand defined by being highly beautiful and highly powerful, but it’s a little less edgy than a Lamborghini, so it naturally fits in that space [of SUVs and crossovers] to begin with.” 
It’s a big step up. In 2018, Aston Martin sold 6,441 vehicles total, up 26 percent, year over year. It will likely sell 7,300 in 2019, a spokeswoman said. But the hope is that DBX will have a natural home in North America, with its insatiable lust for crossovers and SUVs. In 2016, SUV sales in the U.S. surpassed those of cars. By 2022, Americans will have  more new SUVs from which to choose than cars.
Elsewhere, Aston Martin’s Atlas of an SUV must also heave onto its shoulders the responsibility of raising market share in China again after a 31 percent jump in sales last year. It’s a can’t-miss opportunity to pounce where rivals like Jaguar Land Rover and Daimler have seen sales stumble.
And the brand must attract more women buyers, an audience Aston Martin has sought since 2015, with indeterminate results. In 2017, the company created a “female advisory panel” to review and provide feedback on current and future products. Last year it scrambled to name a woman to its formerly all-male board. Laura Schwab became president of the Aston Martin Americas division in 2015. Through a representative, both Palmer and Schwab declined to be interviewed for this story.
“Aston Martin is in a good position here,” Brinley says. “When you go into the utility vehicle space, that naturally opens you up to more women.”
The stopgap, until DBX, is Vantage. At least, it should have been. In March, Aston Martin North America sold 93 Vantages out of its 182 total cars sold, its second-best month since the car was introduced. But the company’s ongoing and hefty financing payouts for the sinuous coupe have suggested Aston Martin buyers aren’t as excited as they might be. Steve Serio, the Aston Martin dealer in Boston, said he’s had multiple Vantages languish for months on his showroom floor before they sell.
“My buyers are 98 percent male and between the ages of 40 and 65,” Serio said. They buy rather than lease their cars as well—the exact types of drivers who prefer manual to paddle-shifting by a wide margin. The Vantage, however, is not currently available in North America with a stick-shift gearbox. A Vantage AMR version with manual transmission is due to arrive later this year, while the standard model Vantage will offer it starting in 2020. 
“It’s really the Vantage that’s the concern,” agreed Michael Dean, the senior analyst of European automotive for Bloomberg Intelligence. He noted the higher MSRPs for the new-generation model, which have created a subtle cooling effect on sales. He noted the polarizing new grille, which gapes at the front of the car like a catfish. And he noted that competitor Porsche’s excellent new 911 has received rave reviews.
“While the Vantage isn’t a key driver of earnings, it will impact sentiment toward the shares in the first half of the year,” Dean said.
Fortunately for Aston Martin, success in the automotive world is solidified over more time than the first half of this year. “It could be decades before things play out,” Tynan says.
Analyst Dean says Aston Martin has enough access to cash in 2019. Fletcher says it has well accounted for contingencies like Brexit and is optimistic in spite of a subtle downturn in global auto markets. “Aston Martin is one of the most bullish despite everything,” he notes. 
The analysts agree that if the company can stay conservative with cash expenditures while managing to produce high-performance products with such regularity that it becomes routine, it has a real chance of beating its current challenges.  
Unsurprisingly, Palmer himself has recommended taking a long view when evaluating the company’s fortunes.
“We said at the time of the IPO not to buy us if you are not going long term,” Palmer told Bloomberg in February. “It’s all about growth through 2023.”

Emaar Properties PJSC, the developer of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, and Aldar Properties PJSC in Abu Dhabi, have gained this year as better-than-expected results and appealing dividends attracted investors. Damac Properties PJSC, on the other hand, has extended its declines with more outflows on the radar.
U.A.E. real estate stocks have been battered in the past two years amid increasing supply and faltering demand as lower oil prices hurt economies across the Gulf. Dubai residential prices have dropped about 25 percent from a peak in 2014, according to Craig Plumb, head of Middle East research at broker Jones Lang LaSalle. He estimates a contraction in the single digits this year.
Emaar Properties and Aldar have entities tied to the local government as their main shareholders. Both have “succeeded in generating growth at the bottom of the cycle,” said Selima Mrabet, a financial analyst at Tunis-based equities research firm AlphaMena, warning that conditions are likely to remain difficult this year. “This move can only be sustained if it will be fueled by good news. The market needs to restore confidence in the real estate sector.”

Damac’s shares have declined 56 percent in the past 12 months and in February the company posted its lowest annual profit since going public in 2013. The stock could be excluded from MSCI Inc.’s main benchmarks in a review next month as it fails to meet technical requirements, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, an equities strategist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai. That could trigger further outflows, he said. It fell for a third session on Wednesday.
The company’s head of investor relations, Amr Aboushaban, said in an email that many of its future developments in Dubai have already been sold and that it’s “noting indications of market stabilization.”
Listen to a podcast on why Dubai’s real estate slump is no blip.
Damac is going through a “difficult journey” as its business model isn’t as flexible as its Dubai competitors because it only offers luxury developments, said Alphamena’s Mrabet. Oversupply and fierce competition will drop those who didn’t implement effective and efficient strategies “out of the race.”

But AMR may not be quite the golden age Trump expects.
On the plus side for him, according to his Attorney General William Barr, special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t accuse Trump or his campaign of conspiring with the Russian government to swing the 2016 election. The  question of collusion or no collusion – not an actual legal term, but still the benchmark by which Trump’s role in this has been judged, thanks mainly to Trump constantly yelling “NO COLLUSION!” – is now closed, writes Noah Feldman.
Mueller also punted to Barr the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, and Barr declined to run it back. But the AG dismissed obstruction too hastily,  writes Cass Sunstein, raising the odds that it will rear its head again. Mueller’s full report is still hidden, and until we see it all, we can’t know if Barr’s call was legitimate, Bloomberg’s editorial board writes.
What we already know from the probe is mortifying enough, notes Tim O’Brien, including the fact that Trump employed  many, many convicted criminals in his campaign and transition. Trump  claims the report marks a “Total EXONERATION!,” but his lawlessness in other areas is already out in the open, and he  still faces a raft of other investigations, Tim writes in a second column. Trump’s  impeachment risk is much lower in the AMR era, writes Jonathan Bernstein, but there are still grounds, and investigators are still looking for more. 
Further Mueller Report Reading:
British parliament is  due to vote tonight on whether to wrest the wheel of the Brexit clown car away from Theresa May. It probably won’t, but the prime minister still lacks the votes for her Brexit deal, which parliament has already rejected twice. With a new, slightly extended Brexit deadline still coming soon and no plan in sight, the actually  good idea of simply canceling Brexit is gaining political steam, even among some Brexit supporters, writes Therese Raphael. Alas, the politics are still too dicey to make this a real possibility, Therese adds. 
Further Brexit Reading:
Markets are still  grappling with the implications of the yield curve inverting – short-term rates going higher than long-term rates, a predictor of the past several recessions. Mohamed El-Erian writes there are many reasons to think, gulp,  it’s different this time – although he adds fears about the yield curve could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. And the yield curve isn’t the only recession signal flashing: Mark Whitehouse notes  economists’ forecasts have started to diverge noticeably, which has happened in each of the past three recessions.

With her understanding of the kinds of companies Buffett has acquired in the past, Tara has come up with a list of 20 possible purchases, including a certain American airplane-maker in hot water lately.

OPEC+ wants to delay a decision on ending its production cuts until June, but that  won’t give it any more clarity about the outlook for oil demand, writes Julian Lee.

President Trump said he supports releasing the whole thing to the public. That’s a good idea.
The real report’s about this big.
Donald Trump’s presidency will forever be divided into at least two eras: Before Mueller Report and After Mueller Report. But AMR may not be quite the golden age Trump expects.
On the plus side for him, according to his Attorney General William Barr, special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t accuse Trump or his campaign of conspiring with the Russian government to swing the 2016 election. The  question of collusion or no collusion – not an actual legal term, but still the benchmark by which Trump’s role in this has been judged, thanks mainly to Trump constantly yelling “NO COLLUSION!” – is now closed, writes Noah Feldman.

Muffman. But the story also resonates because it confirms our prior beliefs about the sorry state of the world. 
The rich always use money and connections to help their offspring, and this is more of the same, if only more hilarious and criminal than usual. The dark side of it is that the conditions motivating such behavior are getting worse: Widening inequality is making social networks (the old-fashioned kind; though being an Instagram influencer apparently doesn’t hurt) increasingly vital, writes Leonid Bershidsky, in a way that  reminds him uncomfortably of the status quo in Russia and former Soviet republics. If we could make college more about quality education and didn’t give outsize rewards to those who game the system, then incentives to cheat would fade. (It would also help, as Tyler Cowen wrote yesterday, if colleges weren’t so  afraid to flunk unqualified kids.) 
While we’re at it, we should also  stop giving college athletic coaches the god-like power to admit athletic recruits, writes Noah Feldman. This was a systemic flaw the alleged perps exploited after they learned merely buying a building wasn’t enough to get their kids into Yale. A coach, on the other hand, can admit anybody who can fog a mirror or photoshop themselves into a pole-vault.
And what’s truly nuts about all of this is that it   doesn’t matter where you go to school. Joe Nocera runs through a long list of the many wealthy, successful business leaders, including Tim Cook and Warren Buffett, who did not get degrees from fancy colleges. Going to Harvard may help you get that first job, but it won’t help you become, for example, the CEO. 
After watching the rest of the world go first, the FAA finally  grounded Boeing Co.,’s 737 Max 8 airplane, which has been involved in two fatal crashes in the past five months. This was obviously the proper call, but it only came after several days of Boeing and the FAA repeatedly declaring the plane was perfectly fine to keep flying, Brooke Sutherland notes. Now Boeing still must take the bottom-line hit of grounding the plane and addressing its issues, but blew its chance at getting reputational credit  for doing the right thing right away, Brooke writes.
A day after routing Theresa May’s Brexit deal, parliament voted against leaving the EU with no deal at all. So that disastrous outcome will be avoided, at least – but only temporarily. Currency traders have been vigorously buying the British pound, apparently believing many bad outcomes will be avoided, notes Lionel Laurent. That’s dangerous, because  most options available to the U.K. still look very bad; and even the worst outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit, are still on the table, Lionel writes. 
Further Brexit Reading: 
One of the worst features of America’s health-care system is the stroke-inducing medical bill you often get after a hospital stay. This happens so often there’s a name for it: “balance billing.” This is when every provider you see in a medical emergency is, darn the luck, out of your insurance network, and you personally get billed the GDP of a small nation for it. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are working on a fix, Bloomberg’s editorial board writes, and  Congress needs to approve it quickly.
The Trump administration and Congress, meanwhile, keep poking at the problem of exorbitant drug prices, in ways that occasionally threaten the profits of drug makers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. This could inspire these companies to take matters into their own hands. Insurance giant UnitedHealth Group Inc., for example, just announced a drug-rebate plan that favors patients –and could also help fend off more regulation, writes Max Nisen.
Big Tech’s power has led to a revival of interest in antitrust law, with Elizabeth Warren and others calling to split up giants such as Facebook Inc. and Google. But a new U.K. study proposes regulators could instead try to zero in on problematic Big Tech practices, halting them immediately when necessary. This make more sense, and is a bigger threat to the giants, than the blunt approach of breakups, writes Alex Webb. 
Noah Smith, meanwhile, suggests the challenges of the future, from climate change to China’s geopolitical ambitions, could mean the government would be  better off harnessing Big Tech rather than destroying it.

Most of them are electric. 
Most of them are electric. 
Source: Aston Martin
Source: Aston Martin
When it comes to the most expensive luxury cars, auto shows are increasingly irrelevant.
For years, the most prestigious automakers in the world have saved their best debuts—and the bulk of their event marketing budgets—for such glamorous locales as the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, the Goodwood Festival of Speed, and the Villa d’Este at Lake Como. Auto shows may draw a lot of people, but with their fluorescent lighting and retro carpeting, they’re hardly a seductive showcase for wealthy private buyers.
The exception is the  Geneva Motor Show. 
With press days starting next week and a public opening to run from March 7 to 17, the annual event near Lake Leman will be the first gilded showcase of the year for the likes of  Bugatti,  Koenigsegg,  Lamborghini, and  Pininfarina, among others.
“Auto shows for automakers to send messages to each other—or basically, just show off—are going away. That has gotten really expensive,” says Matt DeLorenzo, the senior managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. “The only show that has that still really going on is Geneva. This is where the Italian design houses and the Bentleys and Bugattis of the world can really show off, and they do.”
Credit the attitude partly to the fact that no major automaker makes its headquarters in Switzerland, so the country is in spiritually neutral territory, unlike New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Frankfurt, or Tokyo.
“In Geneva, they actually sell cars to really rich people,” DeLorenzo adds, noting that the region holds some of the world’s wealthiest people, who are happy to deign to visit the Palexpo center, where the show is held. At least it’s near the likes of the Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, and Jaeger-LeCoultre watch houses. “Aston Martin may skip a show in the U.S., but they’ll be at the Geneva show with a full product line, selling cars from the stand. It’s a totally different dynamic than any other car show on the face of the Earth.”
Where the fashion world flocks to Paris for its seasonal runway spectacles, tout le monde from the elite automotive world convenes in Geneva.
This year in Geneva has turned the hypercar knob three clicks to the right. Koenigsegg will bring a much-anticipated successor to the  world record-setting Agera RS; Pininfarina will show the its first-ever production car, an expected all-electric, 1,900hp, elegant beast; and Bugatti may bring an $18 million modern take on the iconic Atlantic from 1936. That’s just the start.
Each of the supercar brands in attendance is cashing in on the global appetite for extremely expensive, extremely limited editions of cars from heritage brands. It’s a market that seems to be stable, if only in small quantities. When your cars cost  $2 million each, you don’t have to sell many to survive.
“These types of cars are being built in the 10s,” DeLorenzo said. “There are certainly enough people who want to have one of 10 of something. Or even one of 100.”
French brand Bugatti will show an “110 ans Bugatti” tribute Bugatti Chiron Sport to celebrate the anniversary of the brand’s founding in 1909. That is the latest of the Chiron series and follows the  $5.8 million Divo that Bugatti brought to Pebble Beach last August. More spectacular though, and currently secret, will be a second Bugatti car with a rumored $18 million price tag. It may be a modern take on the iconic Bugatti 57 SC Atlantic that Bugatti has announced it will also bring to Geneva; the new one-off version is rumored to have been commissioned by former Volkswagen Group chief Ferdinand Pieech.  
Sweden’s Koenigsegg will bring the much-anticipated successor to the Agera RS, code-named Ragnarok, which is a term from Norse mythology that connotes the apocalypse. Company executives have said that the model they will show in Geneva may not carry that name, but they expect it boast an update to the twin-turbo, 5.0-liter V8 engine in the Agera RS, with horsepower above 1,360. And a whale of a tail. 
Italy’s dual pride and joys—Ferrari and Lamborghini—will each bring supercars to Geneva, though they’ll likely be divided in purpose. Ferrari has announced it will bring the  F8 Tributo, the evolution of the 488, a turbocharged V8 with 710 horsepower and a six-figure price tag. (To the untrained eye, it looks just like the 488.) 
Lamborghini will bring the edgy Huracán Evo Spyder, a tuned-up open-top version of its segment-leading  Huracán. The Evo, a higher-powered, 5.2-liter, V10 engine that produces 640 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque. It’s so fast it will get to 62 miles per hour in just 3.1 seconds, with a top speed of 202 mph. That’s slower than the new  McLaren 600LT Spider and  McLaren 720S Spider, though perhaps more visceral—and louder—to drive.
In the meantime, Alfa Romeo will bring Giulia Quadrifoglio and Stelvio Quadrifoglio “Alfa Romeo Racing” limited editions made to honor the brand’s return to Formula 1. Showgoers will also see the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti, or “Turismo Internazionale,” and the new Alfa Romeo Giulietta. 
The British will invade Geneva, too: Aston Martin is going to debut the Project 003, the third high-performance, mid-engine car the company has built in recent years, following the $2.6 million Aston Martin Valkyrie and Valkyrie AMR Pro. (Those cars were called “001” and “002,” respectively). It’s expected that Project 003 is some sort of street version of the Valkyrie and  will go on sale by 2021. 
There are plenty of other lesser-known—but, in some cases, no less outré—new cars to see this year in Geneva. Many come from small, heritage-house automotive jewels, obscure startups, or once-dormant brands from around the globe.
Count  Pininfarina’s Battista foremost among the lot. The 89-year-old Italian design house famed for outfitting yachts and Ferraris has said it will make just 150 of the electric marvel to sell at a price of more than $2 million.
The 1,900-horsepower electric supercar is said to have a top speed of 250mph and a driving range of 300 miles under all-electric power. It looks stunning: slender LED headlights grab attention in the absence of a conventional front grill, and a wide light spans from one headlight to the other, acting as a daytime running light system. Its sleek body recalls the PFO that Pininfarina showed reporters at Pebble Beach last August. 
Hispano Suiza, the Spanish car company originally founded in 1904, will bring an electric car, too: the Carmen. It’s an all-electric grand tourer based on the unforgettable, art deco-style, 1938 Hispano-Suiza H6B Dubonnet Xenia. The historic company hopes to use the Barcelona-made car to relaunch itself back into the car-making business—and it’s accepting pre-orders now.
And Ginetta, a 61-year-old small British racing company based in Leeds, England, will show a half-million-dollar V8 supercar it has teased online. Ginetta says its 600-plus-horsepower car will have a top speed of 200mph, though it has yet to announce the name publicly.
It better be something good. We’ve already got everything from a 003 to a Ragnarok. This year in Geneva, it’s going to be hard to stand out.

“Four years isn’t enough,” Mahmoud Badr, one of the proposal’s sponsors, told talk show host Amr Adib late Saturday. About 125 of Egypt’s 596 legislators had signed the petition, and they’re still debating whether the change would affect El-Sisi’s second term alone or apply retroactively to his first term, Badr said.
Parliament Speaker Ali Abdel-Aal said Sunday he had referred the petition to committee. The term extension would have to be approved by parliament and in a national referendum because it would require a constitutional amendment. El-Sisi’s current term is to expire in 2022.
Momentum has been building for some time to either remove the current two-term limit or extend the length of the terms. A separate petition is currently before a Cairo urgent matters court.
Even before El-Sisi was re-elected to his second term last year, several lawmakers suggested amending the charter. The move was quickly shelved, however, amid concerns it would look like an El-Sisi power grab.
The former general-turned-president has repeatedly said he serves at the pleasure of Egyptians and has no ambition to become another “pharaoh,” as his predecessor, longtime autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak, was dubbed.
But even before winning his first election in 2014, El-Sisi launched a sweeping crackdown on Islamists that has also expanded to include activists and other potential opponents. In the 2018 presidential elections, all major challengers either bowed out, or were arrested or disqualified. The man who emerged at the last minute to run against him was an ardent supporter who won less than 4 percent of the vote.

Almost 15 months after rounding up dozens of Saudi Arabia’s richest and most powerful people and imprisoning them in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has declared the raid a lucrative success.
An anti-corruption commission headed by the crown prince said a total of about $107 billion -- a mix of cash, real estate, companies and securities -- has been recovered from 87 people.
Aside from confirming a $1 billion payment from the former head of the National Guard, the government has said little about the nature of the individual settlements. Less than four months ago, the crown prince told Bloomberg News that $35 billion had been collected from the prisoners. Verifying the commission’s claims is made more challenging by the opacity of the Saudi market. Closely held companies rarely disclose financials and the value of real estate -- the preferred asset of many wealthy Saudis -- is obscured by unrecorded transactions and restrictions on buyers.
Detainees have been trickling out of prison for more than a year. Saudi-Ethiopian billionaire Mohammed Al Amoudi, was freed just last Sunday after being held in an undisclosed location on bribery and corruption charges. Also released within the past few weeks: philanthropist and former government minister Amr Al-Dabbagh; former McKinsey & Co. partner Hani Khoja; and Sami Baroum, an ex-managing director of one of the kingdom’s biggest food companies.
Authorities have constrained post-prison life for many of those targeted, with travel bans and heightened surveillance within the country.
This is the latest status of four billionaires:
Date of release: January 2018Change in net worth since day before his arrest: down $4 billion to $15 billion
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud
Arguably the most high-profile target of the crackdown, Alwaleed was released after 83 days in detention, looking thinner but praising the kingdom’s leadership. He told Bloomberg News shortly afterward that he signed a confidential “confirmed understanding” with the government and that operations at his business empire were back to normal. Shares of his investment group, Kingdom Holding Co., have dropped 22 percent since his arrest.
Alwaleed, Saudi Arabia’s richest person, has a 95 percent stake in the company that comprises half of his net worth. In October, Kingdom Holding signed a $1 billion loan, its first financing since his arrest, and the firm’s chief executive officer said last month that it’s considering spinning off some real estate investments. Alwaleed, known to be a restless globetrotter, is said to have been banned from traveling abroad. He has about $2.6 billion of assets outside the Middle East.
Date of release: January 2019Change in net worth: down $1.4 billion to $8.7 billion

Al Amoudi, the nation’s second-richest person, was released Jan. 27, six weeks after Saudi officials confirmed he was being held on corruption and bribery charges and would stand trial. His fortune originated with a government contract during the reign of King Fahd and is now mostly tied to assets outside the kingdom.
He owns the biggest fuel company in Sweden and is the largest individual investor in his native Ethiopia, where he owns gold mines, hotels and agricultural tracts. While his businesses abroad continued to operate independently during his detention, the status and control of his Saudi assets -- which include a chain of gas stations and an engineering firm -- is unclear. Al Amoudi is healthy and in good spirits and has met with senior managers of his companies, according to a person close to the billionaire, who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.
Date of release: January 2018Change in net worth: down $700 million to $3 billion
Kamel, a self-made finance and health-care entrepreneur, is a pioneer of modern Islamic finance. His fortune stems from Bahrain-based Albaraka Banking Group and Dallah Albaraka, a sprawling Jeddah holding company that controls businesses spanning health care, real estate and food manufacturing.

Kamel was also one of Saudi Arabia’s earliest media magnates. In the 1970s, he founded one of the country’s first television production companies and was an early investor in Middle East Broadcasting Center, a regional media giant whose chairman, Waleed Al Ibrahim, was also detained and released in January 2018.
After the emptying of the Ritz, the government took control of 60 percent of MBC, including shares belonging to the Kamel family, while Al Ibrahim retained his 40 percent share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Released: January 2018Change in net worth: down $520 million to about $950 million
Alhokair is a co-founder and major shareholder of the Fawaz Alhokair Group, a franchise retail company he formed with his brothers in 1990. He was freed after reaching a settlement with the government, a senior official said at the time.
The company is preparing to sell 30 percent of its shares in its Arabian Centres mall unit, a listing that had previously been put on hold because of Alhokair’s arrest. Shares of the company -- of which he owns 23 percent, according to recent Saudi stock exchange filings -- have tumbled 41 percent since his detention.

Saudi-Ethiopian billionaire Mohammed Al Amoudi was released more than a year after his arrest in what authorities said was a crackdown on corruption, becoming the latest detainee to be freed under mysterious circumstances.
Al Amoudi was let go after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed raised his case during a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, the premier’s office said. A Saudi official said in December that Al Amoudi was charged with corruption and would face trial.
Al Amoudi is the third-richest billionaire in the Middle East, with a fortune valued at $8.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was no official Saudi explanation of his release and it’s unclear whether he will be barred from leaving the kingdom, like some others who were freed.
The kingdom and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman have come under unprecedented global pressure after the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents at the country’s consulate in Istanbul in October.
Several other prominent detainees were released over the past few weeks, including Amr Al-Dabbagh -- a businessman who was formerly chief of the Saudi investment authority -- and Hani Khoja, a McKinsey & Co. partner who co-founded Elixir, a consultancy. Sami Baroum, former managing director of food processor Savola Group, was also freed, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Bakr Binladin, a Saudi billionaire who had headed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group, was briefly released to attend a family funeral but sent back to prison on Sunday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Al Amoudi was detained in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel in November 2017 along with dozens of princes, officials and businessmen as Prince Mohammed declared a campaign against corruption.
Critics denounced the purge as a power play and a shakedown, a charge the government denies. While most detainees were released last year, a few high-profile figures are still being held, including former Economy Minister Adel Fakeih and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah.
It’s unclear whether those sent home recently faced any charges or have gone through a settlement process; the government has not commented on or confirmed the releases.
Al Amoudi’s arrest was of particular interest to Ethiopia, where he owns vast assets. In May, after his visit to Saudi Arabia, Ahmed said that he had inquired after Al Amoudi and was sure he’d be freed soon.
Saudi authorities have also released two male associates of a group of prominent women’s rights activists who were arrested in May. Abdulaziz Al-Meshaal, a businessman and associate of the women, was released recently, according to people familiar with the matter, while lawyer Ibrahim Al-Modaimigh was released in December.

Damac Properties PJSC’s stock has plunged by about two-thirds in the past 12 months, while Emaar Malls PJSC and Emaar Development PJSC are both down 34 percent. That performance sets them up for exclusion from the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in May under the compiler’s criteria for membership in the gauge, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, equities strategist at the research arm of EFG-Hermes Holding Co. Their departure could lead to combined investment outflows of about $220 million, he said.
The three companies are by far the worst performers in 2019 among the eight stocks on Dubai’s real estate and construction index, a gauge that’s dropped in the past year as building in the emirate outpaced expected demand growth. The housing component of Dubai’s consumer-price index has fallen for all but three months since at least May 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The recent share-price losses put the developers out of the coverage range of compiler MSCI Inc.’s main emerging-market index, which considers only large and mid-cap stocks, according to Al Hajj. Added to that is the fact that they have low free-float levels, he said. Robert Ansari, head of Middle East business at MSCI, did not respond to a request for comment.
Read: Dubai Is Achilles Heel to EM’s Worst-Performing Property Stock
The companies have the lowest weight in the MSCI U.A.E. Index, which is used for calculating the main emerging-markets gauge. If deleted, they “will no longer benefit from passive inflows into EM beyond May,” Al Hajj said in an emailed response to questions. Removal would spark outflows of $80 million each for Emaar Development and Emaar Malls, and $60 million for Damac Properties, he estimated.
Under one scenario for the review, Abu-Dhabi based Aldar Properties PJSC could be considered the U.A.E. cutoff stock, with Damac being classified as a small-cap and Emaar Malls and Emaar Development being excluded for failing free float, Al Hajj said.
However, in a second scenario, if the foreign room for another U.A.E. index member, Dana Gas, is above 25 percent at the end of the review period, Damac will end up being the cutoff, potentially saving the status of Emaar Malls and Emaar Development. While too early to confirm, as the considered date is the end of April, “Damac is looking like a high probability deletion,” Al Hajj said.
Amr Aboushaban, investor relations chief at Damac, said the company qualifies under two of MSCI’s four criteria for remaining in the emerging-market measure, and “nothing is stopping us from meeting the additional requirements” as the developer works to reduce volatility in a cyclical stock market. Damac has “remained focused on the fundamentals of our business” after expecting the real-estate slowdown, enabling it to remain liquid and “capture opportunities,” he said.

Some, like BP Plc CEO Bob Dudley and Tesco Plc CEO Dave Lewis, are handing over after years spent transforming their energy and retail empires to cope with the tectonic forces of environmental issues and online shopping. Others, like Alison Cooper at Imperial Brands, a tobacco company, are stepping down because they didn’t adapt to changing markets.
The players in a week of big changes:
The Record: Dudley will retire as CEO of BP early next year, a long-anticipated step after more than nine years running the energy giant. He took the helm during BP’s darkest period, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and is widely credited with rescuing the company from that disaster.
Investor View: BP shares have risen about 11% during his tenure, compared with a 27% return for the FTSE 100, and production is growing again.
Succession and Outlook: Dudley is succeeded by Bernard Looney, BP’s upstream chief, who faces an immediate challenge – whether to pivot the company toward cleaner, but typically less profitable forms of energy, or focus on fossil fuels even as demand growth slows.
The Record: Lewis was hailed as the man who fixed Tesco. He guided the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain back to health from a massive accounting scandal that came to light weeks after he took over in 2014. Lewis  streamlined Tesco, closing U.K. fresh-food counters and pulling back from international markets like South Korea and Turkey. His acquisition of wholesaler Booker has reduced the company’s exposure to the troubled British retail market as consumers shift spending online.
Investor View: Tesco shares have returned about 1.4% a year under Lewis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 5% average annual gain for the FTSE 100.
Succession and Outlook: Lewis is handing over to Ken Murphy of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., a surprise choice. When he takes over next year, Murphy will need to keep frisky discounters Aldi and Lidl at bay. Beyond that, he’ll need a strategy for the technological revolution that’s upending retail, including mining a trove of customer data to boost Tesco’s online business.
The Record: Cooper’s nine-year stint in charge of Imperial Brands Plc got off to a strong start but fizzled as the owner of Gauloise cigarettes and Blu vaping devices failed to keep up with bigger rivals and nimbler developers of smoking alternatives like Juul Labs Inc. Under Cooper, Imperial expanded its presence in the U.S. by acquiring the Winston and Kool brands. But the backlash against vaping prompted a profit warning, fueling investor unrest and hastening her departure.
Investor View: Imperial Brands shares have returned 4.9% a year under Cooper, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 7.1% average annual gain for the FTSE 100.
Succession and Outlook: An incoming CEO, yet to named, will have to navigate the storm over vaping while accelerating the company’s overhaul. Imperial Brands has been trying without success to sell its premium cigar business, and investors are calling for greater transparency over its finances.
The Record: Martin Gilbert is leaving as vice chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen Plc, the asset manager he helped found more than three decades ago. Gilbert lost his grip on power earlier this year when a dual CEO structure, in place since the company was created by a 2017 merger, was scrapped; Keith Skeoch became the sole chief executive.
Investor View: Standard Life Aberdeen  has plunged 29% since Aug. 8, 2017, the day the merged company’s shares began trading. This compares with a 3.1% gain in the FTSE 100 since that date. 
Succession and Outlook: Skeoch has a tough task. Big name active money managers are charging too much for mediocre returns, and many investors have shifted to passive funds that track benchmark stock and bond indexes and offer much lower fees. What started as a trickle has turned into a flood, forcing fees lower and triggering consolidation and job losses.
The Record: Hill’s role as chairman of Metro Bank Plc was under scrutiny since the start of the year, when the lender said it had incorrectly classified hundreds of millions of pounds of mortgages, failing to set aside enough capital to cover risks. That surprise led to questions about the 10-year-old bank’s viability, then to calls for Hill – Metro’s co-founder – to go.
Investor View:  Metro Bank was a star performer, touching a high of a little over 40 pounds ($49.39) last year, easily outperforming the U.K.’s blue chip stock index. By the beginning of 2019 they had halved, and since the loan misclassification announcement the stock has lost about 90% of its value.
Succession and Outlook: The bank is looking for a sucessor to Hill. Metro’s attraction was its growth strategy, and getting this back on track will be his or her priority. Speculation has mounted in recent weeks that the bank may not be able to outrun its problems and might be sold. Metro has said so far that it’s considering asset sales to repair its finances.

The Federal Trade Commission wants to know how e-cigarette manufactures are selling, advertising, and promoting their products, which are already facing scrutiny elsewhere in the executive branch and in Congress.
Juul Labs Inc., R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company, Fontem US, Logic Technology Development, Nu Mark, and NJOY are being compelled by the commission to provide it with data on their advertising and marketing; websites and social media used to advertise or sell their products; any affiliate or influencer marketing; and promotion on college campuses from 2015 through 2018.
The companies are already under intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who has said he wants to ban all flavored devices; the Food and Drug Administration; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and two House committees. In addition, Massachusetts, San Francisco, Michigan, and New York are moving to ban sales, and multiple state attorneys general are investigating whether Juul violated consumer protection laws by marketing to people under age 18.

The companies will be required to show their sales tactics don’t hurt the public health, or they could face marketing restrictions under a proposed FDA rule.
Juul says it is facing 55 lawsuits in more than 20 states. The FDA has warned the company it may have violated the law by claiming its devices are safe.
R.J. Reynolds Vapor, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco Plc, makes an e-cigarette device called Vuse. Fontem, part of Imperial Brands Plc, sells vaping products under the Blu brand. Altria Group Inc. stopped selling Nu Mark MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products last year.
The companies are also being asked to provide information about their sales, product flavors, nicotine concentrations within their devices, and number of devices given away.

Alison Cooper took tobacco out of Imperial Brands’s name, but couldn’t shift its dependence away from traditional cigarettes fast enough. Her successor will have to.
Imperial’s next CEO will need to see through the smoke.
Imperial Brands Plc’s Alison Cooper is stepping down in a cloud of raspberry scented smoke.
The timing isn’t surprising. It comes exactly a week after the British-based maker of Davidoff cigarettes and the Blu electronic device,  lowered expectations for sales and profits after taking a hit in the U.S. vaping market. The warning brought to a head discussions about the company’s future leadership as the board conducts its search for a successor to Chairman Mark Williamson.Change is clearly needed. The shares of the smallest of the world’s major tobacco companies are roughly back where they were at the start of Cooper’s 9-year watch, having lost more than half of their value since a 2016 peak.Her successor faces a tall order. The new CEO will have to figure out how to make Imperial a strong force in tobacco alternatives. It currently ranks fourth in electronic smoking devices by units sold on a four-week basis. But in the heat-not-burn segment, its Pulze product is a relative newcomer in the Japanese market, where the products have taken hold more quickly than elsewhere. It’s important to have a clear strategy in each segment since no one really knows exactly where the market’s headed.Finding the right path forward won’t be easy, given the crisis engulfing vaping in the U.S., which has prompted efforts by President Donald Trump to ban flavored products and nicotine pads while some retailers including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes.
Imperial Brands has underperformed rivals during Alison Cooper's tenure

Note: Total return including dividends
They must find a way through this. One option would be developing a boarder suite of tobacco alternatives alongside Imperial’s Blu vaping device. Stepping up development in heat-not-burn segment would also be wise.
Rival British American Tobacco Plc has hedged its bets, with a presence in both vaping and the heat-not-burn segment. This is a model that Imperial should follow. But this would likely mean more investment.
Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, says Imperial can afford to spend more. First of all, it’s core business of traditional cigarettes ­ — including local brands such as Winston in the U.S. — is cash generative. Plus, its 2 billion-pound ($2.5 billion) asset disposal program and decision to abandon its policy to increase its dividend by 10% annually should give it scope to act.
The new chairman must also address corporate governance issues. Bloomberg News reported that investors and analysts had voiced concerns about Imperial’s earnings calculations and strategy.

Note: four week analysis
Imperial has long been seen as a takeover target, but it is now particularly vulnerable given the share price weakness and that industry consolidation is back on the agenda, even after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks.
Japan Tobacco Inc. is often mooted as the likely predator, although it would have to find a way to deal with competition constraints.
If the new chairman and chief executive don’t raise their game on alternatives, then someone else might light up even more radical change for them.

Imperial Brands Plc said Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper is stepping down from the U.K. tobacco company, a week after it warned that sales of cigarette alternatives are falling short of expectations.
The maker of Blu vaping devices said Cooper, who has been in the top job for nine years, will leave once a successor is found. She is the second CEO to announce a departure from a blue-chip British company in two days, after Tesco Plc’s Dave Lewis on Wednesday.
Imperial shares rose as much as 2.4% early Thursday in London.
The company said last week that earnings growth ground to a halt in the latest 12 months after a drastic slowdown in revenue from smoking alternatives and weak cigarette sales. That came after the outbreak of a mystery illnesses linked to vaping led to a U.S. crackdown on the practice.
Under Cooper, 53, Imperial has struggled to keep up with bigger rivals like British American Tobacco Plc in the world of e-cigarettes and devices that heat tobacco rather than burning it. Upstart Juul Labs Inc., at the center of the storm over vaping in the U.S., also stole a march on the established players.
Imperial, the smallest of the major international tobacco companies, has yet to find a buyer for its premium cigar business, after it announced plans for a sale earlier this year.
The shares have fallen more than 20% this year. After a runup that ended in 2016, they’re roughly back to the level when Cooper took over in 2010. Her departure continues a leadership overhaul that began earlier this year when Imperial said it was seeking a successor to Chairman Mark Williamson.
Cooper’s move follows Bloomberg’s story on a confidential report by financial communications adviser Tulchan, arguing for more financial transparency at the company, after investors and analysts voiced concerns over its accounting.
In June, Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg slammed Imperial’s earnings calculations, saying the company includes non-operational factors such as gains from asset sales and uses that definition of profit as a factor in setting executive bonuses.
“It’s time for a clean sheet and a new management team,” said Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment Management.
Investors have also expressed concern with Imperial’s commitment to smaller, local brands at a time when smoking is in decline. While she has streamlined the portfolio in some areas, the company four years ago expanded its U.S. operations with the acquisition of Winston, Kool, Salem and Maverick cigarettes. 
“Alison has driven a sharper focus on Imperial’s strongest brands and markets, halving the number of cigarette brands to ensure a higher quality of growth,” Williamson said in a statement."

As the Food and Drug Administration’s plan to restrict the e-cigarette industry takes shape, driven by a spate of vaping-related illnesses, cigarette sales aren’t yet reflecting smokers’ concerns that vapes might not be the safer alternative to traditional smoking that marketing campaigns were built around.
Sales trends for the past month, including the period since the FDA’s Sept. 11 announcement that it would pursue a ban on flavored vapes, suggest that the combustible cigarette market has yet to see a boost in demand following the Centers for Disease Control’s public health warnings about vaping. Sales of e-cigarettes have slowed, meanwhile, as regulators weigh their options to regulate the nascent phenomenon.
Fitch Ratings said in a report Thursday that it expects “significantly slower growth” in vaping in the short term given tighter regulations. In the long term, Fitch said tougher rules could benefit larger tobacco manufacturers, as consumers pivot to “closed systems” that are generally viewed as safer products.
Recent IRI data show that cigarette volume declines for the four-week period ending Sept. 22 stayed “roughly unchanged” from the prior four weeks, at down 7.7%. Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery said he was “surprised that cigarette volume trends did not yet show a more obvious benefit from sequential vapor declines”.
Similarly, Wells Fargo says the latest Nielsen data suggests cigarette industry volume declines moderated only slightly, to down 6.7% in the four weeks ended Sept. 21, against a 12-week contraction of 7%. Analyst Bonnie Herzog continues to believe that more bad news for e-cigarettes, as well as an FDA ban, could still result in improved cigarette volumes, as vapers potentially return to cigarette smoking -- which is “not the FDA’s desired outcome.”
Growth in tobacco alternatives “may be deferred a little,” says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Duncan Fox, adding that several more months of weakness need to be seen “before a panic from tobacco companies.”
As several states move to ban flavored vapes that appeal to teenagers, traditional cigarettes are likely to benefit, but “the growth will not be linear,” Fox says. New devices are likely to spur growth in the industry, and the market for heat-not-burn, vapor and cannabis, will probably remain “the growth engine for a heavily regulated industry for some time.”
For now, e-cigarette sales are already slowing, and Juul, in particular, is suffering from a crackdown after the FDA accused it of illegally marketing e-cigarettes as less harmful than traditional cigarettes. IRI data show an 11% decline in e-cigarette sales in the four-week period ending Sept. 22, while Nielsen suggested e-cigarette sales volumes rose about 38% in the latest 12 weeks, slowing from growth of 48% in the prior period.
Read More: Walmart to Stop Selling E-Cigarettes Amid Vaping Illness Reports
The decline was led by Juul, which most “feels the pressure” from the recent crackdown together with increased competition, said Wells Fargo’s Herzog. Juul’s dollar share, which declined sequentially, has been picked up by competing e-cigarette companies Blu, NJOY, Vuse and Logic, she said.
But there are still a lot of unknowns, analysts say. “The numbers have fallen as retailers have stopped selling,” said BI’s Fox. “Whether that is what is actually happening, though, is tough to know,” since sales over the internet or at small shops, for instance, may not be reflected in the data.
“Stronger regulation is needed, fast,” Fox said. “I can see why the FDA is taking some time to get it right. Get it wrong and they may make things worse.”"

As Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft Corp. enjoy loyalty and ongoing revenue streams from subscribing services for games, both Apple and Google enjoy a clear advantage in something far more valuable: attention.
What these companies are really competing for isn’t share of the games market but consumer time. A minute watching Netflix or swiping Tinder is a minute not spent playing GTA or Super Mario Kart. 
In that respect, Google and Apple are both able to grab user attention multiple times per day thanks to their iOS and Android smartphones. Even Nintendo’s handheld Switch can’t compete.
Sony has the potential to push growth even faster in its games network as it fends off subscription rivals

Complicating the matter for Now is Sony’s own rival offering,: PlayStation Plus, which goes for $9.99 per month. Now is a streaming service like those provided by Netflix Inc. or Spotify Technology SA, while Plus is more of a community that allows online multiplayer games, offers just two free PS4 titles per month, and provides some other benefits.
By cutting Now to $9.99 per month, Sony’s gross margins and average selling price on that service will suffer. Yet the unit economics mean that longer-term revenue and operating profit in this division can expand. By my reckoning, Sony should be able to hit 1.5 million paid Now members by the end of September 2020; if not, then I would consider PlayStation Now a failed product that needs to be reassessed.
As proof, we can look at Plus. It offers a lesser games catalog than Now, albeit with other compelling features, but had 36.4 million subscribers at the end of March – that’s 50 times more than Now. Price is a major factor in users’ purchase of a subscription, according to Nielsen Co.’s Superdata. So with that hurdle lowered, Now ought to be attractive enough to get the same level of attention.
Yet if loyal consumers want both access to the deepest catalog of games, and interactive features and other benefits, they shouldn’t be forced to shell out twice. Instead of milking customers, Sony would be better served by either folding Now and Plus into one service or offering a steep discount to have both.
This isn’t just out of fairness to customers, but a matter of survival.  Nintendo’s Switch Online is just $3.99 while Microsoft has Xbox Game Pass at $9.99. Apple’s Arcade is $4.99, and Google’s Stadia costs $9.99. By asking for double its nearest rival, Sony is throwing away the advantage it enjoys by having a superior product for the sake of a few dollars more. That’s reminiscent of its failures with Memory Stick storage cards and BluRay DVDs, mistakes it ought not to repeat.
Sony cut the price of its Now games service from $19.99 to be more in line with rivals

Note: This is a selection of offerings, services may not be equivalent. Discounts may be offered for longer subscriptions.
With five big names now offering games subscriptions, it’s clear that the business model is evolving beyond single-unit sales. By selling all-you-can-eat packages, Netflix and Spotify schooled Apple at a time when the iPhone maker was still charging per song and per movie.
Sony can also learn from Netflix and Home Box Office Inc. that offering competitive set-price packages doesn’t mean you need to forgo blockbuster titles. In fact, Sony’s access to the highest-quality games is the moat that rivals will struggle to cross.
The move toward games subscriptions will be good for the entire industry by bringing in more total revenue. That also makes it Sony’s battle to lose.

The year keeps getting worse for Imperial Brands Plc shares, 2019’s biggest decliner among European personal and household-goods stocks, as a backlash against smoking alternatives batters the tobacco industry.
The stock suffered a blow on Thursday after the company revised down its full-year revenue forecast and earnings expectations, citing a deterioration in the U.S. vaping market. That follows underwhelming results in May, when first-half sales for next-generation products missed analysts’ expectations.
Imperial Brands shares have lost about a third of their value since reaching a 12-month high in November, a few days after the U.K. maker of Blu vaping devices announced additional investment in its next-generation products, which have been touted as a future driver of growth.
“The category remains unprofitable but management expect it to reach breakeven in 2020, which we believe is unlikely,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Sanath Sudarsan wrote in a note. “Imperial provided little comfort on the underlying business model.”

The warning from the maker of Blu vaping devices adds to the fallout from a backlash against e-cigarettes that has already scuttled the biggest potential merger in the industry. Imperial’s shares plunged 13% on Thursday, wiping out more than $3 billion of market value. 
“It calls Imperial Brands’ and the tobacco industry’s longer-term business model into question,” said James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC. “The implications should not be under-estimated.”
Early Signs of Vaping Health Risks Were Missed or Ignored
Imperial’s warning comes a day after Altria Group Inc. abandoned talks on a possible merger with Philip Morris International Inc. and installed one of its own executives at the helm of embattled e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. U.S. health officials are scrambling to identify a mystery illness linked to vaping, denting prospects for what had become one of the biggest new growth markets in the industry. Consumers are now questioning the devices, touted to carry fewer health risks than traditional cigarettes.
Imperial Brands, the smallest of the major tobacco companies, has lost more than half its market value from a 2016 peak. With a tighter research budget than rivals, the company has struggled to keep up with devices such as Juul and Philip Morris’s IQOS, which heats tobacco without burning it. After years of shrugging off that market in favor of vaping products, Imperial recently introduced its first heated-tobacco device in Japan.
Imperial’s smoking-alternative business remains unprofitable but will move toward breaking even through 2020, Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper said on a call with investors. The U.K.-based company, which sells Winston cigarettes in the U.S., said earnings per share were roughly flat at constant currencies and sales rose about 2% in the 12 months through September.
“It will be bumpy over the coming months, and there may be some short-term pain,” Cooper said. Regulation will weed out the industry, leaving a few responsible companies, she added. “Therefore there will be a much better competitive environment.”
The Trump administration said earlier this month that it would soon remove all flavored e-cigarette nicotine pods from the market, and only allow them back in stores after they gained approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Several U.S. states have moved to restrict vaping, and Walmart Inc. has decided to stop selling e-cigarettes in its home market.
The entire industry has been shuddering, not just the small independent vape companies that may have a harder time dealing with stricter policies from the FDA. In the past month, British American Tobacco Plc said that it plans to cut 2,300 jobs and Japan Tobacco Inc. announced it will eliminate 3,720 positions.
BAT shares fell as much as 4.8% Thursday.
Imperial’s sales of smoking alternatives rose about 50% this fiscal year, slowing from the breakneck 200% pace of the first half. The company also cited a tougher market for tobacco in countries such as Australia.
Several potential buyers have expressed interest in its premium cigar business, Imperial also said. The company has put the unit up for sale as part of a plan to raise as much as 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) from asset disposals.

Imperial Brands, maker of Winstons and Blu e-cigarettes, has cut its profit guidance. Things are looking pretty bleak for Big Tobacco.
Feeling Blu.
The crisis engulfing the American vaping industry has claimed its first European victim. Imperial Brands Plc, the British-based maker of Winston cigarettes in the U.S. and the Blu electronic device, cut its sales and profit guidance on Thursday, a day after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks amid increasing Washington scrutiny of illnesses associated with the smoking alternative.
Imperial in part blamed a slowdown in U.S. demand for electronic cigarettes for its expectation of flat earnings in the year to Sept. 30. It had anticipated expansion of between 4% and 8%. Revenue will expand by 2%, at the low end of its 1% to 4% range. The shares fell as much as 11%.
Some American retailers, including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes, while President Donald Trump is moving to ban flavored products and nicotine pods. All of this came together to weigh on Imperial’s sales in the final quarter, when it was also running a big marketing campaign for its Blu device.
So far the problems haven’t spread to Europe or Japan (the most developed market for devices that heat rather than burn tobacco). Imperial expects sales of its new generation products to increase by 50% this year. That may look eye-watering but it’s below previous expectations.

This is a worry for all of Big Tobacco, which is investing billions of pounds in innovative new products. Philip Morris has developed the iQos “heat not burn” device, while British American Tobacco Plc has a suite of alternatives.
The idea is that manufacturers use the cash flows from their traditional cigarettes business to develop products they describe as lower risk. As smoking rates decline, these devices are meant to pick up the slack among consumers. The transition hasn’t been smooth. Growth slowed in Japan last year, where older people proved more reluctant to follow tech-savvy early adopters of alternatives.
The scrutiny in the U.S. is clearly a serious problem for this potentially huge, but nascent market. Yet there’s an irony too: The crackdown on vaping might drive some of the adults who’ve switched to vapes back to cigarettes.
While tobacco alternatives have huge potential, cigarettes are still the main driver of the industry

Note: Tobacco alternatives include smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes and devices that heat, rather than burn tobacco.
Although gross profit margins on alternatives are approaching those of cigarettes, according to Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the traditional product remains the driver of profit and cash flow for the industry. A slower decline in the numbers of traditional tobacco smokers would be terrible for public health, but it might end up easing some of the financial pressure on Big Tobacco, at least in the short term. While the industry has always been a big dividend payer, there have been increasing doubts about whether this is sustainable.
Tobacco stocks have underperformed the market this year

Note: Normalized as of 12/31/2018
Greater regulation of alternatives could also play to the big companies’ advantage. Most — though not all — of the individuals who’ve fallen ill used black-market vaping pods. A tightening of the rules could favor the devices made by large manufacturers, which have decades of experience lobbying lawmakers. These companies have deep pockets for research and development too.
Nevertheless, unless the industry can develop alternatives that are genuinely less harmful, the outlook for what was Big Tobacco’s last great hope looks bleak. Expect more vaping dreams to go up in smoke.

While U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to “do something very, very strong” after hundreds of reported cases of lung illnesses related to electronic cigarettes, public health officials in the U.K., the biggest market in Europe for the products, endorse vaping as a way to wean people off smoking.
It’s the prevailing view across Europe, where authorities are more sanguine because the ailments popping up in the U.S. have largely been linked to vaping liquids laced with THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, which is off-limits in much of Europe. Use among European teenagers is also much lower than in the U.S., as is the nicotine content in popular vaping products.
“If you’re a smoker and you have not stopped smoking, try vaping,” Martin Dockrell, head of tobacco issues at Public Health England, said in an interview posted on his Twitter feed this month. The government agency has repeatedly said vaping is 95% less harmful than cigarettes.

Data for percent of population 
The response to the vaping crisis underlines a deeper difference in the two regions’ approach to smoking alternatives. U.K. health bodies are leading a push for acceptance of products such as Imperial Brands Plc’s Blu and British American Tobacco Plc’s Vype as a way to get people to quit smoking, which is linked to cancer, heart disease and other ailments. Conversely in the U.S., which has seen countless tobacco lawsuits over the past decades, cigarette alternatives are feared to be a possible gateway into smoking.
What aligns both regions is that smoking rates have fallen, while vaping numbers have climbed. In the U.S., about 13% of the population smoked cigarettes last year, down from some 18% in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. In the U.K., the rate has come down to 14% from 19%, while declines have been slower in countries like France and Germany.
The U.K. is Europe’s No. 1 vaping market, with 6.3% of the adult population using such devices, but far fewer British teenagers vape than their counterparts in the U.S. About 1.6% of 11- to 18-year-olds said they used e-cigarettes more than once a week, according to a Yougov survey published by anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and Health in June. The Health & Human Services Department said Wednesday that the proportion of regular vapers among U.S. high school students has risen to one in four, citing preliminary data from a new survey.
Vaping Was Called Safer Than Smoking. What Happened?: QuickTake
U.K. authorities said they received seven reports in 2019 of adverse reactions suspected to have been caused by vaping, with no fatalities. Meanwhile, there have been 380 U.S. reports in recent months about the mysterious symptoms linked to the practice, including six deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Vaping liquids that contain THC are hard to find in Europe, which may explain why the EU hasn’t seen similar health scares as in the U.S. State health officials in New York have pointed to vitamin E acetate as a likely culprit for the respiratory symptoms, as the substance has been found in some products used to inhale THC.

Europe’s effort to push cigarette smokers toward vaping and heated tobacco devices is rooted in a public health approach called harm reduction that gained acceptance in the 1980s for prevention of HIV and other diseases among sex workers and injecting drug users. The approach seeks to diminish the impact of risky behaviors by promoting infection-blocking tools like clean needles and condoms. The strategy contrasted with efforts like the “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign championed by Nancy Reagan.
“We are clear vaping is not without risks, but compared with smoking tobacco it is far less harmful,” said Rosanna O’Connor, director of alcohol, drugs and tobacco at Public Health England.
European authorities have combined their embrace of e-cigarettes with tougher regulations -- restricting marketing to children, for example, and imposing lower limits on nicotine content -- that have made the new devices more acceptable to health officials. The U.K. prohibits vaping companies from targeting teens. Real or fictitious characters that could appeal to youths are banned, as are depictions of e-cigarette users who appear to be under 25.
The European Union also has lower limits on nicotine levels in e-cigarette fluid, permitting a maximum of 20 milligrams per milliliter, compared with 59 milligrams per milliliter in Juul Labs Inc.’s vape hits. In order to enter EU markets such as the U.K., the U.S. company has had to dilute its nicotine liquids there.
London-based BAT, which on Thursday announced 2,300 job cuts as it repositions itself to focus on smoking substitutes, says it shares the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s concerns that marketing of some flavored vaping products could appeal to children.
“At the same time, it is hard to overestimate the role that the responsible marketing of flavors plays in helping adult consumers move on from combustible products to alternative tobacco and nicotine products,” BAT said in a statement.
Juul recently opened shops on Chinese e-commerce sites Tmall and JD.com as it seeks to expand worldwide.
Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, has campaigned and given money in support of a ban on flavored e-cigarettes and tobacco and supports efforts to reduce global demand for tobacco worldwide.
Some European countries have highlighted risks of e-cigarettes, including addiction and the possibility that they could encourage users to take up smoking. An August report sponsored by the German health ministry concluded that while they may help smokers quit, they should be regulated more strongly to reduce the public’s use of the products and prevent cardiovascular risks.
Still, Europe’s approach has been less adversarial, according to Jonathan Fell, principal at London-based investment manager Ash Park, which owns shares in Philip Morris, BAT and Altria.
“In the U.S. there’s still this mindset that what is the enemy is the tobacco industry, not the harms from smoking,” he said.

After the quietest month in more than six years, initial public offerings are finally picking up in Hong Kong.
Just one company went public in the Asian financial hub in August, Hands Form Holdings Ltd., in a tiny HK$130 million ($17 million) IPO. The last time only one company listed in a whole month was in April 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
While it’s not unusual for the summer months to be quiet with many bankers and investors on vacation, this month’s activity has been particularly sedate as the city’s ongoing protests and an escalating trade war between China and the U.S. dented investor sentiment.
Activity is now gathering pace, with one company, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc., on the road gauging investor demand for an initial share sale that could raise at least $600 million, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Czech consumer finance company Home Credit BV had a hearing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing committee on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said, meaning it could also start assessing investor demand soon.
And Bank of Guizhou plans to start pre-marketing a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1 billion as early as next week, IFR Asia reported, citing unidentified people close to the deal.
Hong Kong badly needs more deals. With only $10.8 billion raised through IPOs so far, it ranks fourth among global exchanges, behind rival New York. This time last year companies had raised $24.3 billion in Hong Kong IPOs, though admittedly 2018 was a blockbuster year.
Elsewhere, things are also getting busy in Southeast Asia. The property arm of Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi is weighing investor demand for an IPO of its property arm, Asset World Corp., people familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile Australia’s Lendlease Group plans to start pre-marketing a real estate investment trust IPO in Singapore of up to S$750m next week, IFR Asia reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the transaction.

EU foreign ministers will meet today in Helsinki to find ways to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive and protect commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. The talks will build on the momentum from the G-7, which was attended by Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, the U.K. said. Britain will also raise concerns about tensions in Hong Kong.
The U.S. should find a way to   reverse the decline in demand at Treasury auctions before issuing super-long maturities that investors don't even want, Robert Burgess writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Investors submitted bids for seven-year notes that had the lowest bid-to-cover ratio since 2009. The government may end up spending more in interest on its existing lineup than it would save on a 50- or 100-year bond.
A trade truce could negatively impact Southeast Asian nations that have attracted investment otherwise destined for China, Daniel Moss writes in Bloomberg Opinion.

Taylor Swift may be more popular in China than the U.S. Lover, the 29-year-old pop star's seventh album, sold 1 million in China in its first week, Universal Music said. That outstrips U.S. sales, which are expected to reach 850,000 in the period, based on forecasts cited in Billboard magazine. The figures include streaming equivalents.

The company has been meeting potential advisers about the proposed listing, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. The share sale will likely take place next year and could value Blued at around $1 billion, the people said.
Founded in 2012 by former policeman Geng Le, Blued has become an icon for the Chinese LGBT community and attracted more than $130 million in venture capital as of March. Besides providing dating services to its 40 million users, the app also offers live streaming and connects men who want to become parents with overseas surrogates. The services are part of Blued’s larger strategy to diversify its business and generate revenue.
Blued has said that it has its eyes on an initial public offering--ideally in the U.S., which offers a simpler IPO process and deeper capital markets. The trick for Geng will be convincing investors that he can expand his operations in a country where gay people have few legal protections and every new service pushes the frontiers of government tolerance and social acceptance.
Deliberations are at an early stage, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Blued didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The company would join Grindr, the world’s biggest LGBT social networking app, in seeking a U.S. listing. Grindr’s owner, Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., last month resumed preparations for the proposed IPO after an almost yearlong halt due to national-security inquiries from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.

India’s Energy Efficiency Services Ltd., responsible for replacing the state’s vehicles with new-energy cars, is seeking to lease electric vehicles to cab companies amid delays integrating them into government fleets.
EESL has made offers to lease EVs to Ola Cabs, a Softbank Group Corp.-backed ride-hailing service, and Indian taxi firm Meru Cabs, and plans to reach out as well to Uber Technologies Inc., according to Managing Director Saurabh Kumar. EESL already signed an agreement earlier this month with electric taxi startup Blu-Smart Mobility for 500 electric cars, he said.
The taxi companies would also be able to use the agency’s charging network. It’s planning to set up 100 charging stations each in 10 cities by March, Kumar said in an interview.
EESL awarded its first tender in September 2017 for 10,000 cars to electrify the government’s fossil-fuel driven fleet. However, only 1,000 cars are on the roads as the state procurement process has been slow. That tender had been awarded to automakers Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.
“We haven’t met the expectations we had earlier, but from an ecosystem perspective this tender triggered building of infrastructure,” Kumar said. “I am more than satisfied with it.”"

Time To Move, the Swatch Group press event held May 14 to 16 in Switzerland, was something of an experiment. When the group decided to pull out of this year's Baselworld, it had to make other arrangements for 17 of its brands to show their new watches to clients and the press. 
Management decided that the group's six most expensive brands would meet commercial clients during Baselworld at the headquarters of the Hayek Group in downtown Zürich. (The Hayek Group is a private consulting company owned by the Hayek family, the Swatch Group's largest shareholder.) The other brands would meet with clients in local markets. 
As for the press, the six prestige brands decided to invite 200 journalists to Switzerland in May for meetings at the brand's production facilities. ""We are trying to change the concept,"" Blancpain CEO Marc Hayek, said. ""We want to present the novelties in the place where they are created and born."" The goal was to show not just watches the brands make, but where and how they make them. 
So it was that for three days, 200 reporters from 21 countries, separated into small groups by language, traveled around Switzerland's watchmaking region in vans, visiting six brands in six towns. 
Among them were our own Stephen Pulvirent and myself. Stephen reported on the new products; I focused on the factory visits. There we got a crash course on the Swiss system of mechanical watchmaking, essentially a T Tour (T for Terminaison, French for ""finishing""). That's trade terminology for the five stages of watch production, from T0 (the making of movement parts) to T4 (packing and shipping). 
What follows are one reporter's notes on the Swatch Group's whirlwind watch manufacture tour. 
On Day 1, bright and early, our group of 14 reporters from the U.S. and Australia piled into a van for the trip from our hotel in Lausanne up to Switzerland's legendary Vallée de Joux. The valley is nestled in the Jura Mountains that form the western border of Switzerland and France. The hour-long ride takes us up steep winding roads to the Col du Mollendruz, 3,871 feet above sea level, one of two mountain passes that lead to the Vallée below. First stop is the village of Le Sentier, home to the Blancpain manufacture. 
More than 700 people work here, in every phase of watchmaking, from watch and caliber design to movement manufacturing, casing, testing, and after-sales service. (Blancpain sells 30,000 watches a year, we are told.)
Today we'll get a glimpse of movement manufacturing. Our hosts issue us white lab coats, embossed with our names, and off we go. In the basement is the first stage of watch production, T0: the production of movement components, first by machine, then by hand. We're led into a storage room holding the raw materials – brass sheets and steel bars. From the next room comes a loud, rhythmic pounding sound. That's the Atelier Decoupage. We enter and see Essa machines pounding out brass mainplates, 100 pieces per minute. 
We move to the toolmaking workshop. There is a separate tool to cut each component in a watch movement, we are told. ""If there are 300 components in a movement, you need 300 tools,"" our guide says. Blancpain makes almost all its cutting tools itself. 
We move to the Usinage (Machining) section, containing a series of MTR 312 cutting machines that resemble NASA lunar modules. In the machines are 18 to 36 spindles programmed to mill, tap and drill brass components with a precision of 1 to 2 microns. 
Then to Tournage (Turning), a workshop that fabricates gold oscillating weights for self-winding movements. All Blancpain rotors are made of gold, except one: Ladybird watches have platinum rotors, also made here. Next is the Ebauches section, where machines make plates, bridges, springs, levers and other steel components.
In the next workshop, Lavage (Washing), every component is cleaned ultrasonically in hot baths containing natural detergents. Finally, each component goes to a decoration workshop, elsewhere in the Vallée de Joux, where it is decorated and washed again. That completes T0.   
The components then go upstairs to T1, and so do we. T1 is the stage where the components are assembled by watchmakers into complete movements. For these workshops, we must put blue plastic booties over our shoes so that we don't track dirt or dust into the ateliers. 
Here men and women wearing white lab coats, with loupes fixed by a wire around their heads, do pre-assembly of the mainplate, bridges and crown. They use electronic screwdrivers that exert exact pressure on the screws, and eight different oils for lubrication. Then, by hand, they assemble barrels, fix pallets and silicon hairsprings to escapements, and perform all the operations to create complete calibers. 
Every complete movement is tested and adjusted here and then sent to T2, watch assembly, done elsewhere in this building. We, however, head to Blancpain's high complication workshops in the nearby village of Le Brassus. There to greet us, wearing a white lab coat, is Blancpain CEO Marc Hayek.  
""The Farm,"" as Blancpain calls the factory, is a series of small ateliers in what was originally a mill located next to a stream on a hill above Le Brassus. Here master watchmakers make Blancpain's highest complications: minute repeaters, split-second chronographs, tourbillons, carrousels, and complex calendars. Outside one atelier is an amazing display that dramatizes what goes on here: it shows each one of the 740 parts in Blancpain's 1735 Grande Complication watch of 1991, at the time the most complicated automatic wristwatch ever made. 
Here, too, are ateliers devoted to decorating and engraving movement components and dials. We move from atelier to atelier, for the new product presentations by Blancpain executives, including Hayek himself, who presents the new Fifty Fathom watches.
 
In the afternoon, we ride down the road to Manufacture Breguet, in L'Orient, the village next to Le Brassus. We are welcomed by Thierry Esslinger, CEO of Montres Breguet, and Emmanuel Breguet, vice president/head of patrimony & marketing. They pay tribute to two extraordinary watch entrepreneurs. 
Emmanuel Breguet (right), head of patrimony and marketing at Montres Breguet,  showing the author the new Classique Tourbillon Extra-Plat Squelette watch.
This first is Emmanuel Breguet's ancestor, Neuchâtel-born Abraham-Louis Breguet, the genius Swiss watchmaker (and inventor of the tourbillon, patented in 1801) who opened a watch shop in Paris in 1775. The other is Nicolas G. Hayek, Sr., the Swatch Group chairman whose acquisition of the Breguet firm in 1999 revived the company, and who served as its CEO until his death in 2010. 
As we soon see, the spirit of both men inhabits this place.  Our first stop is the Restoration Department. ""This is where Abraham-Louis's DNA lies,"" our guide says. In this atelier, master watchmakers restore Breguet watches going back to the founder's time. We see one watchmaker working on a movement from 1810. Each year, about 20 vintage Breguets are restored here.
We're also shown the Breguet No. 1160 watch, an exact replica of Breguet's celebrated No. 160, the ""Marie Antoinette"" watch, which stood for a century as the world's most complicated watch. It was stolen from a Jerusalem museum in 1983 and later recovered. While it was still missing, Hayek Sr. decided to recreate it. ""It was a challenge that Nicolas Hayek wanted his house, his baby, to take on,"" our guide tell us. It was unveiled in 2008. 
The restoration department is in a landmark building that was for a century the Lemania factory. Nouvelle Lemania, as it became known, was part of the Breguet Group when the Swatch Group acquired it. It made movements for Breguet and third-party clients, most famously for Omega's Speedmaster. Hayek Sr. restored the Nouvelle Lemania building. Then, in 2001, he expanded and upgraded the facility in the first of three major expansions, changing the name to Manufacture Breguet in 2004. 
We leave the original Lemania building along a corridor leading to the modern three-story extension. On the way, we come upon a marker set into the floor, engraved as follows:  LA 1ere PIERRE A ETE POSEE / LE 28 09 2001 / PAR Monsieur NICOLAS G. HAYEK & SON FILS NICK (""The first cornerstone was laid on Sept. 28, 2001 by Mr. Nicolas G. Hayek and his son Nick."") Buried under the cornerstone is a time capsule containing a VHS video cassette with a message from Hayek to the future. And a video cassette player to play it on, in the event there aren't any around in the future! There are also newspapers from that time, with articles about Hayek's revival of the Breguet company.
Breguet employs 800 people in the Vallée de Joux, most of them here. We quickly pass by the T0 machine-manufacturing operations on the ground floor. T0 continues on the top floor, with components hand-finished by artisans. 
To me, the most striking section was Guillochage, where literally dozens of artisans sit operating engine-turning machines. Also called rose engines, the machines engrave dials with intricate patterns of intersecting lines. Abraham-Louis loved the look of guilloché, and employed it extensively on his thin-cased pocket watches that revolutionized watch design. He was the first to use guilloché on dials, we learn, and liked the way diamond-shaped patterns reflected light. At Manufacture Breguet, there are 35 rose engine machines. 
T2, assembly of the watch (fitting of the dial and hands; casing; complications assembly) takes place on level 1, the middle floor. Since Breguet was the inventor of the tourbillon, we get a short class on tourbillons, and learn that the company has six different types of tourbillon cages. 
 
The next morning, we head north from Lausanne, past large Lake Neuchatel and smaller Lake Bienne, into the town of Biel/Bienne (the German and French versions of the town's name; it has been officially known by both since 2005) to Omega's brand-new factory, which opened in 2017. There, CEO Reynald Aeschlimann, in his opening remarks, says that this is ""a great time for Omega."" 
The new, state-of-the-art factory, opened in 2017, is a symbol of a resurgent Omega. It is Switzerland's clear number two watch company, in terms of annual revenue (after Rolex), with sales estimated by Ventobel Equity Research at $2.26 billion wholesale for 2018. Two big anniversaries this year are sure to boost those sales: the 125th anniversary of the creation of the Omega brand and the  50th anniversary of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, when Omega became the first watch worn on the moon. 
There has been an Omega factory on this spot for 137 years, and Aeschlimann is proud to show off the gee-whiz wonders of the new plant. The five-story building was designed by Pritzker-prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban, built with concrete, glass and Swiss spruce.
Here we see industrial, not artisanal, production. Omega produces 3,000 watches a day, Aeschlimann tells us. Which means Omega produces in two weeks  what Blancpain does in a year. All of Omega's manufacturing is now under one roof: T2 (assembling the watch head and casing), T3 (bracelet assembly), and T4 (packaging and shipping). (Movement making, T1, is done elsewhere at ETA factories.) Also here is Omega's METAS testing center for Master Chronometer certification.
A highlight of the factory is its fully automated storage system, which delivers components to the workshops without human intervention. Located in a three-story, fireproof, 3,660 cubic foot space in the center of the building, the storage area holds more than 30,000 boxes containing all the parts necessary for T2 and T3. 
A system of four robotic arms -- our guide, Mariano Samudio, calls them John, Paul, George, and Ringo – and two vertical lifts, moving at breath-taking speed (4 meters per second) fetch the boxes and deliver them along 500 meters of conveyors. They perform 1,400 operations per hour, which visitors can observe through windows on the ground floor, or from above, through a window in the floor on level 4.
Once the components get to the workshops, however, the watch head is created the old-fashioned way, by hand. Ninety percent of the work of casing the movement, placing the dial, setting the hands, adjusting the stem, and so on, is done by hand. 
Unlike in the Vallée de Joux ateliers, we don't go into Omega's workshop, but view what goes on through glass dividers. To keep dust out, Omega does not allow any paper – or visitors – in the workshops. All communication there is done via touch-screen tablets. 
 
After lunch, we ride back up into the Jura Mountains, to La Chaux-de-Fonds, the self-described ""metropole horlogère"" (watchmaking metropolis), population 40,000, that has been a watchmaking town for 300 years. We drive along Rue Louis-Joseph Chevrolet. (Yep, that Chevrolet: the car pioneer was born here. So was renowned architect Le Corbusier.) We turn onto Allée du Tourbillon and arrive at Montres Jaquet Droz. 
Jaquet Droz, which the Swatch Group acquired the year after Montres Breguet, is named for a local watchmaking wizard. Pierre Jaquet-Droz was born La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1721. His genius was to create not only watches and clocks, but automata that helped promote his timepieces. 
His automata were considered wonders of the world. Three androids – the Writer, the Draughtsman, and the Musician – brought him international fame. Finished in 1774, and presented for the first time in La Chaux-de-Fonds, they caused a sensation. They ""performed"" for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in Paris in 1775, followed by a tour of various Royal Courts around Europe. Today, they are in the permanent collection of the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire in Neuchâtel, and are still working (the Museum demonstrates them to the public regularly).
Montres Jaquet Droz continues Pierre Jaquet-Droz's legacy, CEO Christian Lattmann tells us. In its workshops, 60 watchmakers and craftsmen create watches that are objets d'art. They range from off-centered Grande Seconde wristwatches, inspired by a Jaquet-Droz pocket watch with two intersecting dials forming a figure 8, to limited-edition pieces featuring exotic dials and wrist automatons. 
We begin in the showroom, where we meet ""Charlie,"" an android built in 2012 based on the Johnny Depp character Willy Wonka in the movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Charlie's hands hold two bells, which he raises to reveal current Jaquet Droz models. He is made of 2,693 mechanical parts and is animated by a system of 12 cams and 7 electric motors. 
Next, we see why Pierre Jaquet-Droz was considered a wizard. A technician shows us the master's ""Singing Bird Cage,"" made in 1780. It's a large, ornate, hanging cage, with a clock on the bottom, containing two birds. In the center of the cage, running top to bottom, is a crystal column. The technician winds the clock, and for 40 seconds a melody plays while the mechanical birds, with real bird feathers, chirp, moving their wings, beaks and tails, while 12 turning ""streams"" in the column create the illusion of a waterfall. The clock has six melodies, which can play on demand or on the hour. For our 21st century audience, it is amazing. For an 18th century audience, it must have been pure magic.
Knowing that we have just come from giant Omega, whose budgets for world-renowned ""ambassadors"" Lattmann can only dream of, he laughs as he tells me, ""The automata are our Cindy Crawford.""
Jaquet Droz's newest automaton wristwatch is the Magic Lotus Automaton. The dial features a small round watch face surrounded by a flowing steam. The watch dial is onyx and has two gold hands. The rest of the dial is brimming with decorative art creations that are Jaquet Droz's specialty.  
It depicts the four stages of a lotus flower: seed pods, bud, spring flower and fall flower. Two blue disks represent the stream. Also on the dial is a koi fish, a blue dragonfly, lotus leaves, water lilies, diamonds, sapphires, a ruby, and more. 
Push the button on the crown and the stream comes to life. The large disk rotates and the koi moves around the dial, flapping its tail and diving beneath the green lotus leaves. The water lilies bob up and down as the water flows. The entire animation runs for a full four minutes, with eight rotations of 30 seconds each. 
All the elements on the dial are made in workshops here. The koi and dragonfly are hand-carved in gold and painted; the lotus leaves and reed stems are made in Grand Feu enamel on a gold base; the lotus petals are carved from mother-of-pearl with a thin coat of translucent paint.   
The dial of the new Smalta Clara Hummingbird watch is made in plique-a-jour enamel crafted in Jaquet Droz workshops.
In the Atelier de Haute Horlogèrie (T2), each watch is assembled by hand by one watchmaker. Blancpain supplies Jaquet Droz with movements, which JD then modifies. Automata are manufactured in the Atelier Automaton, complete with a small sound studio to create chirping birds and other sounds. The movement in the new Magic Lotus watch, which took three years to develop, has 616 components; 500 of them are for the automaton. 
Painting, enameling, engraving, and sculpting are all done by hand in sunlit, monastery-quiet ateliers devoted to each craft.  
The Magic Lotus watch costs 200,000 Swiss francs before tax. JD will produce 28 pieces in red gold and 28 in white gold.
The main market for these pieces is Asia, Lattmann tells me. But demand is global. Last year, it sold all eight pieces of its remarkable Tropic Bird Repeater watch (price: CHF 650,000) in eight months, one to an American.
 
On Day 3, we head to Plan-les-Ouates on the outskirts of Geneva to visit the Harry Winston Manufacture. The Swatch Group acquired the famous New York diamond jewelry house in 2013 for $1 billion. Waiting to greet us is Nayla Hayek, CEO of Harry Winston, who is also chairwoman of the Swatch Group board of directors. ""You are very lucky,"" she tells us, underlining one of the reasons for the ""Time To Move"" press event. ""In Basel, you see only a few novelties. Here you will see all the novelties.""
In fact, we are lucky to be allowed inside this ultra-secure fortress at all, where millions of dollars worth of diamonds and gemstones are stored. We soon learn that the Time To Move press guests are the first outsiders ever shown the manufacturing ateliers.
While diamond jewelry is Winston's signature product, 180 employees here work on watches, Ms. Hayek tells us. Most of the watches are ladies' jewelry pieces.
It takes a week to produce the dial on Harry Winston's Premier Precious Micromosaic Automatic 36mm watch. It is hand-made using a mosaic glass setting and 14 brilliant-cut diamonds. 
Inside the gem-setting atelier, jewelers peer into Olympus SZ51 microscopes as they set cases, bracelets and dials with precious stones. We see jewelers setting the diamond-encrusted rectangular case of Harry Winston's Avenue Classic 20th Anniversary watches. The top-grade stones, set in Winston's famous ""invisible settings,"" are dazzling. It takes a jeweler four to five days to complete one case. 
Harry Winston watches use ETA movements primarily, mostly quartz in the ladies' pieces. The company gets its moon-phase complications for both ladies' and men's watches from Blancpain. 
Winston, of course, isn't only about women's watches. It has made high-profile forays into the high-mechanical world with its series of Opus and Histoire de Tourbillon watches and its use of exotic metals like zalium, a zirconium-aluminum alloy; the platinum-group metal ruthenium; and Winstonium, its exclusive platinum alloy. 
This year's men's headliner is the 10th and final piece in the Histoire de Tourbillon series. It's the first watch ever to include four separate tourbillons. The four tourbillons are positioned at the corners of the giant case, which extends horizontally along the wrist (45 mm x 32 mm x 12.85 m). They rotate once every 36 seconds, unified by three differentials. Histoire de Tourbillon 10 is a limited-edition of 21 pieces: 10 in rose gold, 10 in white gold (CHF750,000 each); and one in Winstonium (CHF770,000).
HW's newest zalium watch is Project Z13, also known as the Ocean Retrograde Automatic 42MM watch, with a zalium case and buckle. It's the first watch in the Zalium collection with a moon-phase display. This one, exclusive to HW, is unique: its shape is not round, but 12-sided, and it is suspended above the cut-out dial by transverse arms. Its automatic movement is made exclusively for Harry Winston. 
As for the Opus, we do not see the long-awaited Opus 15 (it's been nearly four years since the last one – the Opus 14 ""Jukebox For The Wrist""). However, the company says it expects to unveil it by the end of the year. 
 
We spend the afternoon with Glashütte Original in a hotel near the Geneva airport. GO's manufacture is nearly 500 miles away as the crow flies, in the famous watchmaking village of Glashütte in eastern Germany. Since the company can't bring the press to the manufacture, CEO Roland von Keith tells us (it's a long way from Geneva to Saxony), it brought the manufacture to the press. It set up a few manufacturing operations in the hotel ballroom. We're issued the obligatory white lab coats and head into the faux factory for a final round of novelties and technical presentations. 
In a temporary lab in the center of the room, two technicians perform some of the quality-control torture tests GO runs for shock-resistance and water-resistance. Elsewhere, around the room, watchmakers and technicians are performing demonstrations at benches.    
At one, a watchmaker is blueing screws. First, he mirror-polishes the tiny steel screw by hand, rubbing it on a polishing plate until it is glossy. This process protects it from corrosion. Then he places the screw, which is gray, on a small heating device on the workbench. The screw soon changes color, turning yellow, followed quickly by brown, red, violet, and then, at a temperature of 290° C, the color he desires: a deep blue, at which time he lifts it off the grill.
At the dial printing station, a technician from GO's dial factory in Pforzheim, Germany, demonstrates the ""pad printing"" process of manually applying logos on dials, one at a time. The pad-printing method uses a silicone or rubber ""balloon"" to pick up ink from a negative engraving, called a ""cliche."" Pulling the arm of the machine, the technician lowers the pad onto the negative. Then she slides the pad along a track to position it over a blank dial, and lowers the pad onto it. Voilà: the logo appears on the dial.
At another station, a watchmaker using a microscope is screwing 18 infinitesimal screws into a gold screw balance. The screw thread measures a ridiculous 0.35 mm – hence, the microscope. The watchmaker asks for a volunteer to perform the operation. Adam Craniotes, the irrepressible founder of the RedBar group, offers to be the guinea pig. Craniotes, like the rest of us, is sleep-deprived, which will hamper his dexterity. There's also a good chance he's sipped some of the fine Swiss wine served at lunch at Harry Winston, which won't help either. Amazingly, after a few tries, he manages to pick up a screw with the tweezers. But, alas, he drops it. Our gang groans when he lets us know. One of the group points to the screw, which landed on the counter top. It looks like a single speck of table salt. Craniotes doubles down. After repeated attempts, he manages to pick up another screw, and, mirabile dictu, screws it into a hole. He gets a hero's applause from his admiring peers. Now, only 17 more to go. He leaves those for the pro.
The episode drives home a major theme of the trip. We knew fine watchmaking was complicated. But we come away with a new understanding of just how devilishly difficult it is. And a deeper appreciation for those special souls who master its crafts.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has a busy 10 days ahead of him.
He’s in Pyongyang now, as you’re reading this newsletter, meeting with Kim Jong Un on how to defuse the stalemate with the U.S. over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Then at the end of the month, he’ll be sitting down with President Donald Trump in Japan to try and iron out their differences on trade.
And as distinct as each of these two issues may appear, they were long ago melded into one by Trump.
Help America rein in North Korea, Trump told Xi in 2017, and Beijing will get a more favorable trade deal. It’ll also stop the U.S. from labeling China a currency manipulator.
Beijing’s sway over Pyongyang is substantial, and its decision to support sanctions against Kim’s regime has had a painful impact on North Korea’s economy. How much Trump’s petitions have affected Chinese decision-making is far harder to gauge.

Finding a peaceful solution to the decades-long conundrum on the Korean peninsula would be a considerable achievement and one Trump would undoubtedly burnish. He’s already boosted of being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic efforts.
It may well be Xi’s ability to foster a détente between Pyongyang and Washington that becomes the pivot on which the trade war turns.
And of course that could all be wrong. If the trajectory of the trade war continues to escalate, Giant Manufacturing will be one of the companies that saw it coming first. The world’s largest maker of bicycles began moving production  out of China last September when Chairwoman Bonnie Tu says she realized the “Made in China” era had come to an end. Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch also warned investors this week not to ignore the possibility of  a protracted trade war. The bank’s analysts’ see tighter Chinese capital controls and threats to Hong Kong’s role as a financial center being among the potential fallout.
Trade isn’t all Hong Kong is dealing with. The city’s chief executive Carrie Lam “paused” the controversial extradition bill that had prompted hundreds of thousands to protest. That's not stopped calls for Lam to resign. But so far, the spillover for business appears limited. Home sales have continued at brisk pace and the city’s exchange is preparing for Alibaba’s secondary listing, which could raise as much as $20 billion. That’d make it Hong Kong second-largest share sale ever.
If Alibaba raises $20 billion, it will be one of Hong Kong's largest ever share sales

Another hot topic of conversation for financial markets in Hong Kong and China was the ongoing controversy surrounding UBS economist Paul Donovan's use of the phrase ""Chinese pig"" in a note about pork prices and inflation. China Railway Construction Corp. this week excluded UBS from a bond sale after the comment set off a furor on Chinese social media. That was after the Swiss bank placed Donovan on leave and the Chinese Securities Association of Hong Kong called on UBS to fire those involved.  
Meanwhile, if you're looking for a place to get away for a while, consider Chengdu. The capital of Sichuan province, long famous for its spicy cuisine, is also becoming known for its acceptance of the LGBT community. Businesses are already paying attention, in Chengdu and more broadly in China. The country's so-called rainbow economy, worth about $300 billion a year, is creating new opportunities for companies such as Blued, a gay dating app that also helps couples who want children find overseas surrogates. It's also changing corporate behavior. Weibo, the popular microblogging site, last year reversed a decision to remove content with gay themes after it was bombarded with opposition.
And finally, a look at China's plan to reward good behavior and punish bad through a social credit system. About a dozen local governments have so far rolled out trial versions, but not without problems. In Suzhou, for example, almost none of the residents are aware their city has a social credit system, or that they've already got scores. It's hard to affect behavior with social scores people don't know exist. Bickering between various government bureaucracies has been another issue. That of course doesn't mean the system won't become more effective with time, nor does it assuage concerns that it will be used to suppress dissent. But for now, the social credit system looks more like Kafka than Orwell.

36	BLU	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2019-06-21/next-china-regards-from-pyongyang	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2019-06-21/next-china-regards-from-pyongyang	June 20, 2019, 9:45 PM EDT		"Chinese President Xi Jinping has a busy 10 days ahead of him.
He’s in Pyongyang now, as you’re reading this newsletter, meeting with Kim Jong Un on how to defuse the stalemate with the U.S. over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Then at the end of the month, he’ll be sitting down with President Donald Trump in Japan to try and iron out their differences on trade.
And as distinct as each of these two issues may appear, they were long ago melded into one by Trump.
Help America rein in North Korea, Trump told Xi in 2017, and Beijing will get a more favorable trade deal. It’ll also stop the U.S. from labeling China a currency manipulator.
Beijing’s sway over Pyongyang is substantial, and its decision to support sanctions against Kim’s regime has had a painful impact on North Korea’s economy. How much Trump’s petitions have affected Chinese decision-making is far harder to gauge.
Finding a peaceful solution to the decades-long conundrum on the Korean peninsula would be a considerable achievement and one Trump would undoubtedly burnish. He‘s already boosted of being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic efforts.
It may well be Xi’s ability to foster a détente between Pyongyang and Washington that becomes the pivot on which the trade war turns.
And of course that could all be wrong. If the trajectory of the trade war continues to escalate, Giant Manufacturing will be one of the companies that saw it coming first. The world’s largest maker of bicycles began moving production   out of China last September when Chairwoman Bonnie Tu says she realized the “Made in China” era had come to an end. Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch also warned investors this week not to ignore the possibility of   a protracted trade war. The bank’s analysts’ see tighter Chinese capital controls and threats to Hong Kong’s role as a financial center being among the potential fallout.
Trade isn’t all Hong Kong is dealing with. The city’s chief executive Carrie Lam “paused” the controversial extradition bill that had prompted hundreds of thousands to protest. That's not stopped calls for Lam to resign. But so far, the spillover for business appears limited. Home sales have continued at brisk pace and the city’s exchange is preparing for Alibaba’s secondary listing, which could raise as much as $20 billion. That’d make it Hong Kong second-largest share sale ever.

Jerome Powell is ready to lower rates, but not yet. The FOMC shrugged off pressure from President Trump for an immediate cut, leaving its benchmark unchanged while indicating a readiness to ease for the first time in more than a decade. Fed officials cited economic ""uncertainties,"" dropped their ""patient"" mantra and forecast a larger miss of their 2% inflation target this year. Traders are fully expecting a cut next month.
The number of Iran accusers is growing as evidence mounts that the Islamic Republic was responsible for recent oil tanker attacks. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said there is ""little question"" the country's was behind the action. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Trump skeptic, agreed.

Airbus continued its dominance at the Paris Air Show's third day. Orders for its new long-range jet have poured in from eight customers, including American Airlines, which will purchase 20 new planes, valued at about $2.84 billion, and convert 30 existing orders. The French company is now firmly in the lead over Boeing on order count at the annual faceoff. The Seattle jetmaker had scored a mega-deal yesterday with a sale of its troubled 737 Max to British Airways; today, famed pilot Chelsey ""Sully"" Sullenberger said the model shouldn't be allowed to carry passengers until it can be tested in simulators.
Apple is ramping up a test of a digital-first credit card with Goldman Sachs by adding tens of thousands of its own retail workers to the effort, according to people familiar, the card's first major trial. Sheryl Sandberg said Facebook's Libra, a cryptocurrency pegged to government-backed securities, is a ""long way from launch"" and faces a steep climb to win over regulators. Walmart is betting on a less glamorous innovation: driverless trucks that move on fixed routes between warehouses rather than more complicated home delivery runs. Automating these ""milk run"" middle miles is a cost cutter that could turn into a $1 trillion market.
Dell, HP, Intel and Microsoft joined the chorus of companies urging President Trump to refrain from issuing more tariffs on Chinese goods, including laptops and tablets. The companies submitted joint comments opposing the tariff escalation, saying it would hurt consumer products and industry while failing to address China's trade practices, especially since the levies would hit during the peak holiday and back-to-school sales periods. Just don't bring that up with your neighbor: Half of Americans say talking politics in the Trump era is ""stressful and frustrating,"" and most blame the president for the negative tone, according to a Pew poll.
Disney is reaching deep to make Avengers: Endgame the biggest movie of all time with plans to re-release the superhero film next weekend with new footage that wasn't included in the original. It aims to top Avatar as the all-time global box-office champion, a film released by Twentieth Century Fox, which it now owns. Endgame has grossed $2.7 billion worldwide since April release, while James Cameron's 2009 blockbuster leads with almost $2.8 billion, not adjusted for inflation.

The apparent victory of Hong Kong protesters and a mini-thaw in Russia suggest the two regimes are using a technique known as ""contained escalation,"" writes Leonid Bershidsky of Bloomberg Opinion. If that's the case, activists will end up realizing they can get the rulers' favorable attention if they make small demands and show willingness to negotiate. However, demanding more will only get them beaten up and thrown behind bars.
China's surveillance-based social-credit program is more Kafka than Orwell, Bloomberg Opinion's David Fickling writes. It creates nonsensical, disorganized oppression, not minute control by a monolithic state. Like L.A.'s ""predictive policing"" project—racial profiling with a Silicon Valley sheen—it's more likely to just reproduce the problems of the existing system of petty oppression.
Don't call it weed, call it cannabis. It's not legalization, it's regulation and monetization. And skip the pot puns. That's the crusade of Bruce Linton, the Canadian CEO of $15 billion Canopy Growth, the world's biggest, um, pot company. He's occasionally partial to pink slippers with marijuana leaf embroidery, yet doesn't smoke, vape or eat brownies. In his bid for growth, he's got a deal with Corona beer maker Constellation, bought a U.S. grower for $3 billion and has seen Canopy stock jump sevenfold in two years. Now if only he could get America to regulate.
Chengdu is known for its spicy food. But the capital of Sichuan province is also now gaining a reputation as an LGBT haven. It was voted the gay capital of China in a recent poll by same-sex dating app Blued. Lower rents have lured young people, cultivating a hip, progressive culture that's spawned San Francisco-style cafes and the nickname ""Gaydu.""

Craig Wright famously (in some circles) declared himself the inventor of Bitcoin. Some call him a fraud, including Vitalik Buterin, the known creator of competing digital currency Ether. Wright responded by suing Buterin for defamation, as well as a podcaster and an early Bitcoin investor. In true crypto ethos, Buterin says it is a fight about censorship, free speech and truth. Wright says it is a sabotage of his efforts to stop illegal uses of the currency. ""I designed Bitcoin to stop all of this,"" he says. ""That is why they hate me.""
Three Russians and a Ukrainian were charged by a Joint Investigation Team for the downing of the MH17 passenger jet five years ago which killed 298 people. The team cited a phone call and other evidence they say proves a link between Russia and the breakaway Donetsk region, which was at war with Ukraine. International arrest warrants have been issued, with court proceedings set to begin in March. Meanwhile, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was implicated in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by a UN investigator who said she found ""credible evidence"" warranting further investigation into the Saudi leader's culpability, but no smoking gun.
Sorry guys, you're not special. Lululemon has quietly closed its men's standalone stores in New York City and Toronto. The retailer found that guests respond better to Lululemon ""as a dual-gender brand,"" spokeswoman Erin Hankinson said. Don't worry though: The company still plans to more than double its men's business in the next five years.

The U.S. is considering sanctions to punish Turkey for buying a Russian missile system, people familiar said. The most severe package under discussion will effectively cripple Turkey's economy. The idea with the most support for now is to target several companies in its defense sector.

Airbus bounced back on the third day of the Paris Air Show. The company added orders for its newest plane less than 24 hours after U.S. rival Boeing grabbed the headlines with a mega-deal for its grounded 737 Max. Airbus's new A321XLR now has seven customers lined up for the narrow-body jet. As a result, Airbus is now firmly in the lead on total order count.
Two of Telecom Italia's biggest shareholders are preparing to end their battle for influence over the indebted phone carrier, people familiar said.

Central banks and government officials have few other choices than to seek a weaker currency to make their economies more competitive. China has allowed its yuan to weaken, and it's probably only a matter of time before Japan tries to jawbone the yen lower. Trump isn't wrong to be concerned about the dollar.

It’s 11 p.m. at AMO, an underground lesbian nightclub in Chengdu, and 17 women—in androgynous clothing, their hair closely cropped—line up at the front door to welcome partygoers. Among them is Yang Yang, 25, who started working at AMO (Esperanto for “love”) more than three years ago when she moved to the Sichuan capital in the southwest of China. In that time she’s earned enough to buy a 645-square-foot loft. “I can have fun and drink while making money,” says Yang, who’d trained to be a kindergarten teacher. “How much better does it get than that?”
Yang, her workplace, and her apartment are all part of China’s growing rainbow economy: the ecosystem of consumers, companies, and workers that serve the nation’s LGBT population. State media estimate that this segment of the nation’s economy is worth $300 billion a year—making it the world’s third-largest after Europe and the U.S., they say—fueling a consumer base that companies are eagerly, if cautiously, trying to tap.
“Companies are getting braver, but they can do more and will do more as they grow more accustomed to the market,” says Darius Longarino, a senior fellow at the Yale Law School Paul Tsai China Center who studies LGBT issues in China. “I understand their caution, because things can change with the snap of a finger. And there’s a perception that in China nothing’s allowed unless it’s explicitly allowed.”
A world away from Beijing, Chengdu has become a haven for the LGBT community, whose members are drawn to the relaxed, open vibe. The city sits in a basin surrounded by mountains, which kept it isolated for centuries. Fertile ground and abundant natural resources allowed it to stay mostly self-sufficient, with an attitude that’s both “mind your own business” and “anything goes.” The city of 16 million, best known internationally for its pandas, was voted the gay capital of China in a recent poll by gay dating app Blued. Less-expensive rents have lured young people, cultivating a hip, progressive culture that’s spawned San Francisco-style cafes filled with millennials. Economic growth is comfortable, with last year’s 8% expansion well above the national rate.
“Before I got into college, I probably had never met anyone who is gay, but here this feels like home because all our close friends are gay or bi,” says Katherine Guo, 19, a university student who moved to Chengdu from Guangzhou, a commercial center farther south. “When I was back home, I never told anyone I was bisexual—literally nobody.”
While there aren’t official statistics on Chengdu’s LGBT population, the nickname “Gaydu” has stuck. A 2018 study by Tongle Health Counseling Service Center, the oldest nongovernmental organization serving its gay community, estimated there were 140,500 gay men in the city. Although China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from an official list of mental disorders in 2001, gay, lesbian, and transsexual individuals still live in a gray area. There’s no law against being LGBT, but no rules protect against discrimination, either. China doesn’t recognize gay marriage.
Given this tension, established companies have tried to reach out in subtle ways. Earlier this year, Starbucks Corp. sold rainbow-themed mugs and tumblers that were snapped up. The items included the phrase “Love Is Love,” with no explicit mention of LGBT rights. In 2015, after the U.S. legalized gay marriage, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., its online shopping site Taobao, and Blued held a competition to send seven same-sex couples to Hollywood to get married. They received more than 400 submissions. This year, brands including Bayer, Coach, Diesel, Old Navy, and Shake Shack supported the annual ShanghaiPRIDE week.
In Chengdu, small companies make everything from cellphone cases emblazoned with rainbow colors to designer condoms, and one entrepreneur launched two lesbian-friendly apartment buildings in 2016. (Members of the LGBT community say they sometimes feel they need to hide their sexual orientation from landlords.) Shops on Taobao cater to lesbians such as Yang, who call themselves T’s (for Tomboys), selling masculine clothing in female sizes. Companies offering surrogacy services often hand out flyers at LGBT events.
Still, success depends on toeing the line. Gaydorado, a mobile game that lets players star as a heartthrob in a gay-friendly metropolis, has about 20,000 daily active users who spend several million yuan per month on in-game items. But it doesn’t have the government license required for domestic distribution, and Chinese players must use a technical loophole to gain access, as they do to play some Western blockbuster titles.
The right approach is key, especially since the government can be unpredictable—­supportive at times, then punitive when invisible lines are crossed. In 2017 popular lesbian dating app Rela was shut down after it backed an event in Shanghai to raise awareness for LGBT rights. (It later relaunched.) At other times, the authorities have sought to highlight their tolerance. When China hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008, state-run news agency Xinhua ran a feature promoting nightspot Destination as “Beijing’s hottest gay club.”
“It’s kind of a message to the Western world that LGBT in China, they’re not really living in a very oppressive environment,” says Edmund Yang, who founded the bar 15 years ago. It’s since grown into a gay institution—a four-story complex with an outdoor cafe, art gallery, multicultural center, and clinic that offers free HIV testing.
Blued says there were about 70 million LGBT people in China in 2016, based on the estimate that roughly 5% of the global population is LGBT. But most don’t live an out-and-proud lifestyle: A United Nations Development Programme study of sexual orientation in China that same year found that only 5% of sexual and gender minorities have come out.
Chengdu and other second-tier cities with large LGBT populations, including Chongqing and Hangzhou, are largely ignored by big companies marketing to the demographic, according to operators of gay and lesbian establishments. “I think a lot of big companies don’t do anything outside Beijing and Shanghai because they don’t know that Chengdu and Chongqing have a big LGBT population,” says Kate Thomson, who manages Underground, an LGBT-friendly bar in Chengdu that hosts a weekly pride night. “You can get away with more in Chengdu because it’s under the radar.”
In a survey of more than 7,500 LGBT individuals in China conducted by Blued and gay rights organization Danlan, more than half of respondents indicated that corporations’ support for LGBT policies play the biggest role in influencing their purchasing decisions. According to consultant LGBT Capital, those consumers have a purchasing power of $541 billion.
One company that’s betting on that rainbow economy is AMO, which also has clubs in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Chongqing. It’s planning to open another in Shanghai this year and expand to more cities in 2020. “When we first opened, we didn’t expect demand would be so great even though Chengdu is dubbed the ‘nation of LGBT,’ ” says Xiao Bai, who manages the clubs nationwide. “The desire to find a place to relax, have fun, and date is very strong.” —Sharon Chen and Han Miao, with  Zheping Huang and Dandan Li

The Food and Drug Administration submitted the proposal to U.S. District Judge Paul Grimm in Maryland after he ruled last month in a lawsuit filed by anti-tobacco groups that the agency had illegally allowed e-cigarettes to stay on the market without a safety and public health review.
“The recent epidemic-level rise in youth e-cigarette use is a mounting public health crisis” that requires a robust regulatory response, the FDA said in the remedy brief filed Wednesday.
The plaintiffs want the judge to require companies that make e-cigarettes and cigars to submit applications within 120 days. Grimm will consider both proposals and issue an order that takes them into account.
The FDA also said in the brief that it would aim to finish a draft guideline it put out in March that would ban most flavored e-cigarettes from retail stores within four months.

The FDA began overseeing e-cigarettes in 2016 under the Obama administration. After Donald Trump took office the next year, the agency said it would push back until 2022 a requirement that vape companies submit applications to continue selling their products. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said at the time that he wanted to ensure that a fledgling industry with the potential to reduce harmful cigarette smoking wasn’t stymied by regulation.
Plaintiffs, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the American Academy of Pediatrics, sued the FDA over the delay last year.
Tobacco stocks dipped slightly after the news, with British American Tobacco Plc dropping as much as 1.3% in London. Imperial Brands Plc, which makes Blu e-cigarettes, fell as much as 0.6%. Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc., which took a $12.8 billion stake in Juul last year, was down 0.8% in early trading in New York.
The FDA proposed that a product could still be sold for a year while its application was under review, with some case-by-case discretion for extensions to applicants making progress at completing their filings.
The timing proposed by the FDA would “strike a better balance among public health considerations, and allow the agency some time to prepare to absorb a flood of applications significantly sooner than anticipated,” the agency said in the brief.
The FDA issued a guideline Tuesday to help e-cigarette makers craft applications for review, clearing the way for the agency to move more quickly.

Manhattan condo owners who’ve enjoyed property-tax reductions are heading for the exits of their posh buildings as their breaks are set to expire.
At a sampling of five buildings where the city’s 421-a tax abatement will end this year or next, owners are listing a greater share of apartments for resale compared with other large Manhattan condo towers, according to StreetEasy. Often, they’re not finding takers until the price drops close to -- or less than -- what the seller paid years ago.
“People aren’t willing to pay the same amount for something that’s going to cost them more on a monthly basis,” said Grant Long, senior economist with the listings website. “Figuring out what the right price is, given the expiring abatements, is going to be a challenge over time.”

Manhattan’s would-be buyers are weighing potential purchases cautiously these days, refusing to overpay for homes and causing years of rapid price increases to come to a halt. They’re also tax-sensitive, thanks to new rules that limit how much of their property levies can get written off on federal returns.

Thousands of Manhattan condos built before the 2008 downturn benefited from the now-defunct 421-a, in which developers received property-tax breaks and passed them along to buyers as a way to promote sales in their pricey buildings. Under the program, an apartment’s property-tax burden would be phased in over 10 or 15 years, with the first few years fully exempt. The abatement’s expiration means the unit is subject to the full tax bill.
Buyers -- owners who live in the units and investors who rent them out -- paid top dollar for condos with low carrying costs, probably reasoning they’d recoup their investments by selling at a big profit before their abatements ended, Long said. That strategy won’t work in today’s saturated market.
“The difference between a building with a tax abatement and a building without is probably an additional $400,000 on the purchase price,” said Alon Chadad, broker and co-founder of Blu Real Estate, which is marketing listings at Upper West Side properties with expiring abatements.
At the Avery, a tower at 100 Riverside Blvd. where the breaks will end this year, about 11% of the building’s 266 units were offered for sale at some point between last May and mid-May of this year, according to StreetEasy. By comparison, condo properties across Manhattan with 50 or more units had a median of 4.8% of their units listed in the same time period.
Next door at the Rushmore, where abatements expire in 2020, 8.9% of the units were listed for sale within the past year. That’s about the same share as at the Caledonia in Chelsea, where the breaks also expire in 2020, and Sky House, at 11 E. 29th St., where they end this year.
The apartments are “becoming less attractive for the investors to hold onto, which is why you see so many listed, and they’re also becoming less attractive to buy,” Long said.
100 Riverside Boulevard #19B
At the Avery, a two-bedroom unit on the 19th floor purchased for $2.05 million in 2014 is still seeking a buyer at $1.795 million, after a year on the market. On the 10th floor of the same tower, a one-bedroom marketed by Chadad, for which the seller paid $936,790 in 2008, is in contract after three price cuts, according to StreetEasy. The deal will close this month at $952,750, he said.
“It’s one of those buildings where anybody who bought in ’08 or ’09 would be lucky to break even,” Chadad said. “That’s what we’ve been seeing these last few months.”

Companies like Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc., MacroGenics Inc. and Nektar Therapeutics will be in the spotlight when the annual event kicks off Friday in Chicago.
“Sentiment heading into the conference is notably bland, but there should still be enough stock-specific events to keep us on our toes,” Baird analyst Brian Skorney said in a note to clients. The firm is focused on updated data from Iovance after an initial abstract sent shares soaring on the promise of a cell therapy that may work in solid tumors.
The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has fallen 12% from its March highs as investors lamented some high-profile drug failures and a lack of big deals. ASCO has historically been a positive spark for the sector, although this year’s meeting has drawn noticeably less buzz than some previous editions.
“It’s not fair to call it a down year,” said Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, in a phone interview. The focus this weekend will be on smaller individual presentations rather than large blockbuster drugs, he said.
Iovance shares jumped 7% on Friday before paring gains. Updated results for its cell therapies showed signs of durability in solid tumors as two more patients responded to the company’s treatment in cervical cancer. Iovance updates are seen as “very positive” by Cowen analyst Boris Beaker, who suggests a response duration of 9 months to a year will be needed “to gain significant traction” in skin cancer.
Iovance has gained 57% since initial results were presented in an abstract ahead of the meeting earlier this month.
The most closely watched large-cap drugmaker at the meeting will be Amgen Inc. as it presents early results on a treatment targeting a common cancer mutation known as KRAS. Clinicians have been targeting KRAS mutations for 30 years and Amgen may finally be showing that it is a “druggable” target, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Separately, Blueprint Medicines Corp.’s data on BLU-667 will show how competitive it is with Eli Lilly & Co.’s LOXO-292 in lung cancer.
Here are the companies to watch (all times are Chicago time and subject to change):
Investors are looking for a deepening of responses for Amgen’s AMG 510. The drug targets a specific mutation in the KRAS family that is frequently tied to lung tumors and some colon cancers.
A 25% response rate is the bar for AMG 510 to be “clinically meaningful,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Asthika Goonewardene wrote. Small-cap peer Mirati Therapeutics Inc. makes a similar medicine and could move as much as 30% if Amgen’s drug has positive data, JPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama said.
The data will be presented June 3, followed by investor meeting webcast at 6:30 p.m.
Options in Amgen scheduled to expire on June 7 are anticipating a share price move of 3.3% between now and next Friday.
AstraZeneca Plc and Merck are presenting late-breaking results for their “Polo” study of Lynparza as a maintenance treatment in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer. This may have implications for Clovis Oncology Inc. as the small-cap drugmaker is also planning to pursue pancreatic cancer, SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens wrote.
Findings will be presented at a plenary session on June 2 at 3:15 p.m.
Data from part of the registrational “Arrow” trial of Blueprint’s BLU-667 in RET-altered lung and thyroid cancers is to be presented June 3. BLU-667 would potentially vie with Lilly’s LOXO-292, where both companies have shown competitive efficacy. Investors will be looking at safety and “difficulty benchmarking BLU-667” may drive volatility in Blueprint shares, Berens said.
Investor event will be webcast on Monday at 6:30 p.m.
Results from “Columba” and “Cassiopeia,” late-stage studies of Darzalex in multiple myeloma will be presented on Sunday and Monday.
Citi said that Columba data could drive premium pricing for subcutaneous Darzalex in the U.S. Deutsche Bank said the drug faces limited risk from Sanofi’s presentation of competing CD38 antibody isatuximab, “given Darzalex’s established presence as gold standard.”
Oppenheimer analyst Mark Breidenbach expects Iovance to have a “strong presence at ASCO, with new clinical data expected for two Phase 2 programs in the company’s pipeline of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies.” This includes results from over 60 patients in one arm of the ongoing “innovaTIL-01” trial of lifileucel in melanoma and a “significant update” from the “innovaTIL-04” study of the next-generation cell therapy, LN-145, in cervical cancer.
Iovance will present data on June 1.
Ipsen SA’s presentations include Exelixis Inc.-partnered Cabometyx as well as Onivyde and Somatuline. Oddo BHF said last week that Ipsen is among the top 15 oncology companies.
The initial abstract for Cabometyx in gastrointestinal tumors left Stifel analyst Stephen Willey’s enthusiasm for the drug “muted for now.”
Late-stage results from the “Sophia” study of MacroGenics’s margetuximab in HER2-positive breast cancer will be a “battleground” between bulls and bears, said Loncar. Wall Street wanted to see around a two-month difference on progression-free survival compared to Herceptin, but data in the abstract fell short. Investors will be looking for an update on overall survival, and Loncar said “six months would be spectacular.”
A conference call is scheduled for June 4 at 1:30 p.m.
Piper Jaffray said investors are looking for durability data from a combination of NKTR-214 with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Opdivo in a poster on sarcomas being presented Saturday.
Shares of Nektar have fallen about 60% over the past 12 months after disappointing data in melanoma at last year’s meeting. Sarcoma and updated melanoma data might give Nektar a chance “to get back in investors’ good graces,” Loncar said.
The June 7, at-the-money straddle in Nektar Therapeutics is implying a share price move of 10% between today and next Friday’s expiration.
For Puma Biotechnology Inc., data from the “Nala” study in breast cancer “do not appear clinically compelling” and likely won’t expand the market for oral therapies targeting HER2-positive breast cancer, Leerink said.
Puma Biotechnology options scheduled to expire on June 7 are implying an 11% move in shares over the next 7 days.
Data on Roche’s entrectinib, which showed promise in difficult-to-treat childhood brain tumors, will be presented June 2 at 8 a.m.
Sanofi is expected to present late-stage data for antibody isatuximab in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma on June 2.
Late-breaking results from Seattle Genetics Inc.’s “EV-201” study of enfortumab vedotin will be presented June 3 around 9:24 a.m.
“Given the unmet medical need following checkpoint and platinum therapy, a duration of 6.5-7.5 months should be viewed positively among investors,” William Blair’s Matt Phipps wrote.

Over 15 years the Bolivian businessman built it into a regional powerhouse as Latin America’s second-largest carrier.
But for all its success, the Bogota-based company is now back on a rocky foundation. Its stock price is down by almost 75% since it went public in 2011 and its bonds are trading in distressed territory amid concerns it will struggle to refinance debt. Avianca’s first-quarter loss was the biggest since 2015.
The man most responsible for the mess is the same who so recently was treated as a hero -- Efromovich.
German Efromovich
The self-made millionaire imperiled the airline’s future by last year offering up his 51.5% stake in Avianca as collateral on a loan from United Continental Holdings Inc. His holding company BRW Aviation quickly breached terms of the contract and, as a result, control of Avianca could pass to United’s hands. While that would likely be a positive for Avianca’s minority shareholders and bondholders, the current uncertainty has created myriad problems for the airline just as it faces down a $550 million bond coming due next year.
“We’re very worried by the company’s instability at the moment,” said Jaime Hernandez, president of the Colombian pilots’ union ACDAC, which in 2017 went on strike for almost two months over a wage and benefits dispute. “We were a great company and the management of it recently has been very bad for our operations, our reputation.”
Efromovich, who is also Avianca Holdings SA’s chairman, said in a radio interview in Bogota on Tuesday that there was no possibility of United taking over anytime soon. Avianca’s situation was “controlled,” he told Blu Radio.
In a written response to questions from Bloomberg, he denied that problems at his other businesses are creating risks for Avianca, which isn’t party to the loan. “Everything is aligned with United as per the loan agreement. There is nothing to rectify,” he wrote.
United says it hasn’t seized the Avianca shares and is working with BRW.
But it’s an option it could exercise at any point. Doing so would trigger change-of-control provisions on various loans that could force the airline to come up with roughly $1.5 billion to pay off creditors, according to analysts at Bogota-based brokerage Corredores Davivienda. That’s more than four times the amount of cash it had on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter.
Even if United doesn’t take control, just the fact that it could do so complicates Avianca’s efforts to operate and raise financing. Investors are hesitant to lend to a company that could at a moment’s notice be on the hook for a bunch of money that it doesn’t have.
Chief Financial Officer Roberto Held said Avianca is working urgently to amend loan contracts to account for the situation and still plans to sell bonds this quarter to pay off notes due next year. Meanwhile, it’s sticking to a business plan focused on cutting debt and increasing profitability by selling assets, canceling aircraft orders and scrapping some routes.
The tumult couldn’t have come at a worse time for Avianca. It has been buffeted by surging fuel prices this year along with weaker Latin American currencies and less demand for air travel amid slowdowns in the region’s biggest economies. Chief Executive Officer Hernan Rincon quit in April. And low-cost carriers are adding competition.
Avianca is only the latest difficulty for Efromovich, who has seen parts of the sprawling Latin American conglomerate he built with his brother, Jose, unravel in recent years. His shipyards have shut down. His Brazilian airline was forced to seek court protection from creditors. And now he’s at risk of losing Avianca.
It’s quite a turnaround from 2004, when Efromovich was lauded across Colombia for rescuing the world’s second-oldest airline. (Its first flight was in 1920, ferrying passengers between the municipalities of Barranquilla and Puerto Berrio.) Previously owned by the country’s richest family, it was hemorrhaging money in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the global recession that followed.
Efromovich bought it out of Chapter 11 for $64 million and an assumption of debt. A mechanical engineer by training who got into the aviation business in Brazil, Efromovich doubled the number of aircraft Avianca operated and soon started turning a profit. By last year, Avianca’s 190 aircraft were carrying 30 million passengers, second only to Latam Airlines in the region.
Former President Alvaro Uribe, who granted Efromovich Colombian citizenship in 2005, was among his biggest fans. “We Colombians admire you, we appreciate you, we value you, we consider you an example” of the type of investor the country needs, he said in 2010 when Efromovich received a “businessman of the year” award from newspaper La Republica.
Efromovich’s personal fortune began to turn in 2014, at the start of Brazil’s worst recession on record. He took a loan from Elliott Management to prop up his shipyard business there, which ended up closing.
Meanwhile, Efromovich moved ahead with expansion plans for Avianca, forming a joint venture with United and Panama’s Copa Holdings in which the three airlines would coordinate routes and schedules. Related to the deal, Efromovich’s BRW Aviation borrowed $456 million from United to pay off loans taken by his Brazilian businesses, using his stake in Avianca as collateral.
In April, Avianca said in a regulatory filing that BRW Aviation was in breach of a collateral coverage term of the United loan. That was partly because Avianca’s share price plummeted, causing its market capitalization to dip to $510 million by the end of 2018.
The possibility of a change in control has forced Avianca executives to seek to amend agreements to list United as a potential controlling shareholder. In addition to the bonds due next year, Avianca owes roughly $800 million to European export credit agencies, quasi-government financial institutions that secure funding for exporters, among other debts, according to executives.
Avianca needs to update loan contracts to include United as a potential controlling shareholder “to prevent a breach of the company’s financial commitments,” S&P Global Ratings said in a May 13 note. It downgraded the debt rating further into junk territory, the CCC+ level, citing “higher refinancing risk” due to BRW’s breach.
Of course the loan isn’t Avianca’s only headache, and some observers say Efromovich is getting too much of the blame for the company’s woes.
“The current problems are in good part due to Avianca, a business that has had bad numbers in recent quarters,” said Carlos Enrique Rodriguez, an analyst at Bogota brokerage Ultraserfinco who recommends selling the shares. “Corporate governance has been questioned and that has affected the stock price. But to say Avianca’s problems are all the fault of Efromovich is not entirely fair.”
In the long term, a change in control to United could be a positive for Avianca, said Gimme Credit analyst Cedric Rimaud, who recommends buying the bonds.
“There is still one year before the bonds come due and a lot can happen until then,” he wrote in a report. “If United takes over the control of the company, it will be a very positive news for bondholders, as the credit profile would improve markedly.”
But for now, investors seem doubtful of Avianca’s prospects.
The rating downgrade accelerated a sell-off in the bonds that began at the end of April. The notes due next May now trade at about 88 cents on the dollar, pushing the yield to 23%, according to Trace bond trading data. It’s among the worst performers this year in the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Corporates bond index.
“At first the assumption was that the problems were isolated” to just Efromovich and his outside businesses, said Roger Horn, a senior emerging-markets strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York. “But everything becomes a factor when an emerging-market company is looking to refinance a $550 million bond.”

Carlos Ghosn, who served as chairman and chief executive officer of the world’s biggest auto alliance, added another title to his resume today: defendant.
Pre-trial hearings began Thursday at the Tokyo District Court’s 17th Criminal Court Division, kicking off a new phase in a saga that started in November when Ghosn was arrested just after landing at Haneda Airport on a private jet. Ghosn, wearing a grey suit, didn’t say anything before entering courthouse just before the 10 a.m. meeting.
His detention on allegations ranging from falsifying financial records to redirecting company money into his own accounts shocked the global auto industry. The alliance Ghosn created between Nissan Motor Co., Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was shaken to its core.

In the half-year since, the three-way partnership has moved on. New executives were brought in to restore profitability and navigate through an industry that’s facing disruption from electrification, self-driving vehicles and new business models for transporting people and goods.
Ghosn, 65, is charting a different path, his energy focused on fighting for his freedom, proving his innocence and restoring his reputation. While Ghosn may be tempted to bring the same intensity and energy that he brought as ""Le Cost Killer"" to Nissan, it’s more likely that the pre-trial hearings and trial will be a drawn-out process with little drama.
""The format of argumentation is primarily on paper, not live,"" said Stephen Givens, a professor of law at Sophia University in Tokyo. ""In the U.S., one of the skills that litigators need to have is to be able to think quickly on their feet. There’s very very little of that in Japan.""
Ghosn is facing a total of four charges:
Prosecutors arrested Ghosn multiple times as they handed down the indictments. He was briefly freed on bail, arrested, and then released again, spending a total of 130 days in jail. The former auto executive has consistently denied the charges, describing them as ""biased, taken out of context, twisted in a way to paint a personage of greed and a personage of dictatorship.""
""I hope to be given a fair trial where the truth will come to light and I will be fully vindicated,"" Ghosn said in a statement issued after his second release on bail on April 25.
Junichiro Hironaka
Nissan, which has also been charged on one count for allegedly understating Ghosn’s income, declined to comment on the judicial process.
""The company’s focus is on stabilizing operations and strengthening its management structure, while addressing the weaknesses in governance that enabled this misconduct,"" Nissan spokesman Nicholas Maxfield said.
Read more about Nissan’s struggles to restore profitability.
Thursday’s hearing was for the two breach of trust charges. A hearing for the two charges for financial misconduct will be held June 24, Ghosn's lawyer Junichiro Hironaka said.
The trial probably won’t get underway until Spring 2020, according to Hironaka. Between now and then, there will be several similar pre-trial hearings, mostly likely three or four for each set of indictments. The purpose of the pre-trial hearings, a new procedure enacted in 2005, is to narrow the scope of charges in order to streamline legal proceedings and speed up the trial.
""The pretrial hearing is so important that it can almost decide the outcome, because you have to decide whose testimony the court is going to hear and which piece of evidence the court will examine,"" said Hiroki Sasakura, a professor specializing in criminal procedure at Keio University Law School in Tokyo.
After the pretrial hearing, new evidence cannot be submitted, according to Japan’s code of criminal procedure. Judges can allow new evidence to be presented during the trial at their discretion. The pre-trial hearing process also gives the prosecution and defense an early look into each others’ potential strategy, as they make their case for what evidence to admit.
That process may take a while. Prosecutors have 120 Blu-Ray discs of audio-visual testimony, even as they continue to investigate and gather evidence, the Nikkei newspaper reported this week.
Judges Kenji Shimozu, Kazunori Fukushima and Kenji Matsushita will preside over the proceedings, then issue a verdict. While the trial itself may be even as short as a year, the appeals process could drag out proceedings over several years.
The trial of Japanese internet executive Takafumi Horie on charges of fraudulent accounting lasted five years, including appeals, until he was sentenced to prison in 2011. The former CEO of Livedoor was released in 2013, and has since become an author, social-media maven and rocket industry entrepreneur.
Mark Karpeles, a central figure in the early days of Bitcoin embroiled in the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, was found guilty in March 2019 of tampering with records and given a suspended prison sentence.
Ghosn will be tried alongside Greg Kelly, who ran Nissan’s CEO office and was arrested on Nov. 19, the same day as his former boss. Kelly is facing fewer charges, and Ghosn’s lawyers sought to have him tried separately, a petition that the court denied. Kelly, 62, remains free on bail in Japan.
Two other Nissan executives worked closely with Ghosn and Kelly, but won’t be facing trial. Toshiaki Onuma and Hari Nada struck plea-bargain agreements with prosecutors and cooperated with them before the arrests, according to Hironaka. They provided authorities with a ""substantial amount of statements,"" the attorney said.

Hiroto Saikawa
One question that the defense team says it will ask prosecutors is why Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, Ghosn’s protege-turned-accuser, hasn’t been charged with any crimes. Saikawa signed off on Ghosn’s retirement package, according to an outside corporate-governance panel. Nissan has begun working on a succession plan to identify and promote new top managers, Keiko Ihara, one of the carmaker's three independent directors said in an interview Thursday.
For trials involving multiple charges that result in a guilty verdict, the sentences aren’t added together for each offense. Instead, the maximum prison term is capped at 1 1/2 times the longest possible punishment, according to Sasakura. The maximum fines can be added up. In Ghosn’s case, each of his charges carry a similar maximum sentence of 10 years and a 10 million yen fine."

Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Imperial Brands Plc dropped to a five-year low on concern that a slowdown in U.S. vape sales and weaker-than-expected tobacco revenue in the first half may push the cigarette maker’s full-year target out of reach.
The shares fell as much as 5.1 percent, the most in four months, to 2,210 pence in London. Second-half sales growth would need to more than double from the first half’s pace for Imperial to meet its full-year target of at least a 4 percent increase, wrote James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
The company is under pressure to boost its vaping business as consumers increasingly switch from cigarettes, the longtime driver of profit growth. Imperial has lost U.S. market share in vaping to upstart Juul, whose high-nicotine vapes catapulted it into the leading player in that market. In addition, Altria Group Inc. is planning to sell IQOS heat-not-burn tobacco products there, tightening the competition.
Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper said Imperial is entering the second half with strong momentum behind Blu electronic-cigarette sales. The company has already implemented most of its price increases in tobacco products, which should add to revenue, she said.
The CEO also said she expects vaping products to contribute to profit in coming years.
“Next-generation products are not that far away in terms of adding to the bottom line,” Cooper said in a phone interview Wednesday. The maker of West cigarettes reported a 1.1 percent increase in first-half earnings per share, driven by its traditional tobacco offerings.
Sales of Blu and other cigarette alternatives more than tripled to 148 million pounds in the first half. The Bristol, England-based company has been pumping investment into such products, spending almost 100 million pounds in the period to advertise and get more smokers to switch.
While vaping growth was strong in Europe and Japan, Imperial flagged a first-half slowdown in the U.S., especially in the first quarter. The tobacco industry is facing uncertainty as it awaits clarity from the Food and Drug Administration on regulation amid calls to raise the minimum age for tobacco purchases to 21 from 18.
Imperial already saw some improvement in vaping sales in the second quarter, Cooper said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
The company plans to slim down its traditional tobacco business to focus more resources on vaping. Imperial said last week it plans to sell its premium cigar business, which includes a joint venture distributing Cohiba cigars from Cuba. The unit could fetch as much as 1.5 billion pounds, according to Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies. That would move Imperial closer to its target of raising 2 billion pounds by 2020 through asset sales.

Parmigiani Fleurier has a long history of looking to unusual past masterpieces for inspiration – one of the best known examples is the Pantographe wristwatch, which has an oval case and telescoping hands that mimic the appearance of a pantograph machine (a tracing device that allows one to make a bigger or smaller copy of a drawing or design). The Pantographe is based on a most ingenious oval pocket watch, which was made by the English makers, Vardon and Stedman, around 1800, and which is part of the Sandoz Collection (the Sandoz Family Foundation is Parmigiani Fleurier's parent company). 
Another quite spectacular piece in the Sandoz Collection is a pocket watch made by Perrin Frères, of Neuchâtel, from around the same period as the Vardon and Stedman pocket watch. The Perrin Frères timepiece has a wandering hours complication, in which the minutes are shown in a sector on the front of a watch by a numeral showing the hour, which ""wanders"" across the sector over a 60 minute interval. It's also a repeater, with gongs that have a serpentine shape and which have alternating blue and white stripes, giving them the appearance of snakes. Parmigiani Fleurier has created Toric Capitole wristwatches based on this pocket watch in the past (as unique pieces, although all share the same basic case design and movement) and this year they've released the latest version: the Toric Capitole ""Waves.""
 
This is really watchmaking as art, as was the original pocket watch. There was a period prior to the general adoption of technology necessary for watches to be real precision timekeepers (bimetallic balances, the lever escapement, and mainsprings capable of delivering something like a stable amount of torque across a reasonable power reserve, among other things) during which watchmakers competed with each other in making portable timekeepers of the highest possible amusement value, as to-the-second daily accuracy was something of a crapshoot. As watches became more precise, they also became (in general) less and less ornamental, but there's an undeniable, horological joie de vivre in watches like the Perrin Frères pocket watch and many of its contemporaries, that became something of an endangered species as the age of the precision watch wore on through the mid-to-late 19th century.
The Toric Capitole ""Waves"" is a modern watch technologically, of course, but it's still in the same spirit as the pocket watch on which it's based and like the pocket watch, is a repository of high-craft watchmaking techniques. The dial execution is a new one for the Toric Capitole family of watches, with enamel waves contrasting with the mother-of-pearl minute track, and the double bezel and gracefully downturned lugs combined with the overall flawless finish of the 45mm x 12.1mm case give the watch, interestingly, a more classic feel than the rather baroquely ornate impression given by the pocket watch. 
One of the most breathtaking features of the Toric Capitole ""Waves"" is the movement – this is more or less expected from Parmigiani Fleurier, but the movement has an extra element that makes it stand out, even in the small world of high end minute repeaters (which is a bit of an oxymoron as minute repeaters in general are a high-end affair; the complication seems to have been able to resolutely resist industrialization). The ""Waves"" duplicates the snake-motif gongs found in the original pocket watch – this was done by first resin-coating strips of the gongs, heat-bluing them, and then removing the coating; this leaves the distinctive pattern of blue-and-white stripes that make both the ""Waves"" and the original pocket watch so visually arresting. The gongs are also ""cathedral"" gongs, which make two complete turns around the circumference of the movement, and the resulting deep, rich tones make the ""Waves"" as pleasant aurally as it is rich visually.
High-end watchmaking can be very bombastic, and it can also be technically impressive, and flawless from a craft standpoint, but also rather dull. Doing something original but tasteful in watch design has never been particularly easy and today, it's probably never been easier to make a reliable watch from a purely technical standpoint, or harder to make a really distinctive but coherent design – this is partly due to market pressures, but it's also due to the great inherent challenge that good watch design poses. The Toric Capitole ""Waves"" radiates a certain degree of horological gravitas but its lyricism, plus the unexpected visual charge provided by the snake-motif cathedral gongs, gives it a complex but harmonious character rarely seen from any brand involved in high end complicated watchmaking today.
The Parmigiani Fleurier Toric Capitole ""Waves:"" case, 45mm x 12.1mm, 18k rose gold, sapphire front and back; 30m water resistance. Movement: Parmigiani Fleurier caliber PF321, hand-wound; frequency 18,000 vph; 34mm x 8.5mm with wandering hours. Unique piece, $395,000.

Imperial Brands Plc plans to sell a premium cigar business that includes a joint venture distributing Cohiba cigars from Cuba.
The U.K. tobacco company said it plans to sell the operations to pay down debt and boost investment. The businesses being sold include the Cuban venture as well as Imperial’s own U.S. and international premium cigar units.
The move is part of a plan the company announced last year to raise as much as 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) by 2020 through asset sales, Imperial Brands said Tuesday. So far the company has raised 280 million pounds.
Imperial’s profit has been weighed down by investments in e-cigarettes, in particular to boost its Blu brand. The company is under pressure from rivals with bigger investment budgets and more popular brands.
Under the 50-50 joint venture in Cuba, Imperial distributes and sells cigars under the Cohiba, Romeo y Julieta and Montecristo brands. The sale offers a rare opportunity for another investor to take a business interest in the island nation, which has been isolated by U.S. sanctions for years.
Imperial also has a mass-market lower-end cigar business, and owns the international rights to Davidoff cigarettes, which it sells alongside the Gauloises and West brands.
AZ Capital is advising Imperial on the possible sale.

For the first time, public health officials will ask about Juul by name in an annual youth tobacco survey.
Juul Labs devices have surged in popularity in recent years, coinciding with what health officials have called an epidemic increase in teen vaping.
A language gap is making it harder for U.S. health officials to measure a teen-vaping epidemic.
For some young people who use the popular vaping device sold by Juul Labs Inc., “juuling” is a verb in its own right. Antitobacco groups and health officials worry that has led to confusion when pollsters go out into the field to quiz teens on their nicotine habits for an annual government survey that plays an important role in shaping tobacco policies. This year for the first time, the poll will specifically mention Juul as an example of an e-cigarette.
Caleb Mintz, 17 years old, first tried Juul when he was 15, after he saw his friend holding the sleek device.
“Hearing the word Juul instead of vape makes it sound a lot different,” he said. “It did not look like your typical vape. Giving it a fancy name made it seem like it didn’t have anything harmful in it.”
Mintz didn’t stick with it. He said he saw friends become so addicted that they’d turn to cigarettes for a nicotine fix if their Juul wasn’t in reach. Mintz now considers himself a youth advocate and travels the country with his mother, Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-Cigarettes, calling for e-cigarette curbs.
The National Youth Tobacco Survey is usually compiled each March through May. The updated survey language is expected to capture kids who think juuling isn’t the same as using another e-cigarette.
“We suspect that we may see an increase as a result of the more precise language,” said Brian King, deputy director for research translation in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office of Smoking and Health. “Most kids are aware of Juul now that it has become a household name, but it has also become so ingrained in the culture that some of them may not know it’s an e-cigarette.”
The CDC conducts the survey with the Food and Drug Administration. Results typically aren’t released until late in the year, but preliminary figures may become public sooner. This year the survey will be conducted on electronic tablets rather than with paper and pencil, King said, making it easier to analyze the data.
Youth vaping surged to what government officials last year called epidemic levels. E-cigarette use among high-school students rose 78 percent compared with 2017, to more than 3 million students. Last year, the U.S. survey named brands including Imperial Brands Plc’s Blu and Altria Group Inc.’s MarkTen, which the company has since removed from the market, but not Juul.
Juul Labs made deft use of social media to popularize its device until pressure from the FDA led the San Francisco-based company to shut down its U.S. Facebook and Instagram accounts in November. The company has said it supports efforts to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21.
Juul doesn't prominently refer to its device as an e-cigarette in advertising but does use the word vapor, including in its Twitter handle. While its Instagram account no longer is active, it did often use the hashtag #juulvapor in posts.
Juul spokeswoman Lindsay Andrews said the company makes it clear that its products are intended for adults, and all carry warning labels about nicotine and its addictive properties. “We follow FDA in calling our products e-cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems or vapor across our various forms of communications,” said Andrews.
As “juuling” entered the youth lexicon, the Truth Initiative raised concerns that some users may not know what they’re inhaling. The antitobacco group found 63 percent of Juul users ages 15 to 24 surveyed in November 2018 didn’t know the product contains nicotine, which is considered harmful to developing brains. Some users who knew of the nicotine in Juul pods weren’t aware of the potential downsides.
“I’m someone who’s always been fixated with health,” said Sophia, 22, who runs track for a university. She didn’t want be identified by her full name so her coach and parents wouldn’t know about her Juul habit. Sophia goes through one mint-flavored pod a day, which has the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. She says it hasn’t affected her running.
“It’s seen as something that’s addictive but I don’t know what I’m addicted to,” said Sophia. “It’s been marketed as something not damaging to our health at all.”
E-cigarettes have been hawked as smoking-cessation aids and the FDA took a go-slow approach on regulating them. However, the surge in underage use and the increasing evidence of the devices’ ill effects forced a shift.
“Everybody, including me, previously thought that an e-cigarette is kind of like a cigarette with less junk in it,” said Stanton Glantz, a tobacco researcher at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. But, he said, research is beginning to show that e-cigarettes are “probably about as bad as cigarettes.”
The FDA began to push back last year on the stylized, online-centric marketing by Juul and other companies with messages aimed at preventing youth e-cigarette use. Ads that ran on platforms such as Hulu, Facebook and Spotify warned kids that nicotine could reprogram their brains.
In May, an FDA ad push, part of a larger $60 million prevention campaign, will hit major television networks, said former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb at an event before he left the agency April 5. He said that while the agency had been wary of discouraging adults from using e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking, the youth-use trend “has gotten so worrisome that we’re going to have to now make that trade-off.”
The new ads’ main message will be that teens who vape are more likely to start using cigarettes, Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the FDA, said in an email. Specifics of the media plan, including which networks will air the ads, are still in development, he said.
Still, regulators will need to be agile to track changes in how teens are being introduced to vaping. The CDC’s King said a new e-cigarette called Suorin that comes in shapes including a sleek teardrop device will be added to the survey in 2020. King said Suorin can be refilled with any e-liquid, making it easy to add the marijuana compound THC.

Good afternoon. Here's what you need to know to end your day.
Theresa May just won't give up. She's back in Brussels today to lobby for her proposed one-off, three-month Brexit delay—something her EU counterparts have already said she can't have unless she can persuade Parliament to ratify her divorce deal. The deadlock seems likely to push the endgame into the final hours before next week's deadline.  
With Brexit talks on a knife's edge, the BOE today took the predictable decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.75 percent. The central bank's policy makers indicated they're in no rush to continue with a series of limited and gradual hikes as they wait for more clarity on Britain's future relationship with the EU.
Another setback in finding an Alzheimer's cure. Biogen and Japanese partner Eisai halted a late-stage study of aducanumab, their experimental treatment that had garnered high hopes after rival trials fell short. The bombshell wiped out more than a quarter of Biogen's market value and earned its stock at least nine ratings downgrades. Stifel said it sees no clear growth driver now. Here's more on the disease.
Deutsche Bank is shaking up its wealth management leadership. The head of the European unit slashed the number of regional managers and announced aggressive hiring plans in a bid to jump-start revenue. The lender hired Marco Pagliara from Goldman Sachs to oversee northern and eastern Europe as one of six market heads, down from 14 previously.
Siemens is exploring a combination of its large gas-turbine business with an Asian partner, and has held talks with firms including Mitsubishi Heavy, people familiar said. On the table are a full or partial sale of the division to a joint venture. It's been considering options since at least last June, when Berenberg estimated the business was worth about €3.2 billion.
Wirecard executives in Germany allegedly approved potentially fraudulent transactions totaling €2 million, the Financial Times reported. Last March, four €500,000 payments were transferred from Germany to a Singapore account and were then intended to be sent to Wirecard's Hermes unit in India. Wirecard said the FT's claims are not new and appear to be based on a preliminary report. The outcome of its full investigation will be ""available shortly.""
Italy's banking industry got a rare piece of good news this week, writes Bloomberg Opinion's Ferdinando Giugliano. EU judges ruled that there's nothing illegal about Rome using deposit guarantee funds to prevent lenders from going out of business—a position the European Commission has opposed. However, the Italians shouldn't get carried away. Even if the judgment stands, it will be a Pyrrhic victory.
Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess has many of the qualities needed to manage the German carmaker's pivot to electric vehicles, writes Chris Bryant of Bloomberg Opinion. However, his tactless use of a phrase that evoked a Nazi slogan—""Ebit macht frei""—suggests he lacks at least one key skill that's essential for anyone managing painful change: political and human sensitivity.
The toxic mood surrounding Brexit is starting to infect regulators, too, writes Bloomberg Opinion's Lionel Laurent. The EU financial markets watchdog this week laid out a no-deal Brexit scenario that would, in effect, create a hard border for 6,000 stocks, including 14 listed in the U.K. The result? A chaotic situation that could fracture the world's biggest single market.
Geng Le became an LGBT icon when he left his job as a cop in China to launch Blued, a dating app for gay men. The urge to have a child prompted him to also start an overseas surrogacy service called Bluedbaby. Now he has his eyes on an IPO, ideally in the U.S. The trick will be convincing investors that he can expand his operations in China, where gay people have few legal protections and every new service tests the limits of government tolerance.
Evil travels freely on the internet. Even after the livestreamed horror of the New Zealand massacre, enacting social media reforms will take massive efforts in regulation, requiring the cooperation of tech giants, governments and consumers. The world's democracies have been reluctant to remove content from the web, fearful of mirroring the policies of more restrictive regimes, but the tide may be turning.
Lloyd's of London's 331-year-old exchange for the global insurance market is full of quaint traditions, but some of the anachronisms are less than genteel: A deep-seated culture of sexual harassment.

Look out Uber Eats, there's yet more competition on the horizon. Bolt is preparing to expand into the food-delivery market and utilize its existing network of drivers to do so quickly. Estonia, Finland and South Africa have been picked as the first markets where Bolt will roll out the new service in the next few months. Its expansion follows consolidation of the food-delivery market in Western Europe.
Germany's wine industry is having such a productive year that vintners are struggling to find enough bottles to put all that Riesling and Spaetburgunder in. After the best harvest in a decade, winemakers are having to wait as long as three months for new bottles and can no longer rely on imported supplies. And they're not the only ones grappling with capacity shortages."

Xi Jinping arrives in Italy today, where he will liberally sprinkle investment and talk about China’s commitment to globalization. Then he’ll do the same in France. But his visit is about much more than money.
Europe has reached a point where it needs to work out what it wants from Xi, and where China — with the world’s second-biggest economy and growing strategic heft — fits in the global pecking order.
President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on his allies make it harder for Europe to look to the U.S. as a counterpoint. Even so, the broader question of how Europe navigates between China and the U.S. will remain long after Trump is gone.
As Beijing seeks to expand relations to European companies, governments must manage what’s attached in terms of China’s security interests. Xi, who spoke of his “dear Italian friends” in a paper, listed the sectors China is interested in, and it’s illuminating: telecoms, shipping, aeronautics, aerospace and pharmaceuticals. Europe’s no longer just about ports and roads.
The region largely welcomed China’s investment in infrastructure. Now Europe needs China’s advanced technology and deep pockets. For some nations at least, it is a relationship of uneasy necessity.
Brexit gamble | Theresa May took her Brexit brinkmanship to another level, pushing the European Union to accept a three-month delay and then lashing out at members of Parliament for refusing to back her divorce deal. The standoff is pushing the U.K. to the edge of crashing out of the bloc and into legal and economic limbo. The outrage among lawmakers indicates the prime minister's strategy to pressure them into ratifying the deal may have already backfired.
Liberal dreams | Still angered by Trump's presidential victory despite losing the popular vote, some liberal Democratic candidates in the 2020 race say the U.S. should jettison the electoral college system that gives state delegates the power to choose the winner. While that and other ideas like expanding the Supreme Court stand little chance of success, the debate highlights the ideological and generational divides within the party.
Weapons ban | New Zealand has banned military-style semi-automatics and assault rifles just days after a terrorist attack on two mosques that killed 50 people. The swift move by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stands in sharp contrast with the U.S., where a string of gun massacres has failed to spur political action.
Parting ways | Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban emerged bruised, but not beaten, after Europe's biggest political family froze the membership of his Fidesz party for eroding democratic standards. At home, Orban's pro-government propaganda machine portrayed the suspension as voluntary and a victory over factions that wanted him expelled, rather than humiliation. That gives him the option of either repairing ties or joining forces with like-minded nationalists after May's European Parliament elections.
Isolated kingdom | Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman rode a wave of international enthusiasm for his promises of reform in Saudi Arabia. That all changed after October’s murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and complaints over human rights violations in the Yemen war. With Saudi rulers more isolated in the U.S. than at any time since the Sept. 11 attacks, Glen Carey charts the kingdom's path from the red carpet to pariah.What to Watch
And finally… A former cop in China who created a dating app for gay men called Blued is now helping them to have children using overseas surrogacy services. Geng Le launched Bluedbaby after navigating the surrogacy process to have his son in California. While homosexuality is not illegal in China, offering surrogacy services is a politically complex business. Still, Geng expects the first Bluedbaby birth next month.

The Fed's guidance on interest rates was more dovish than even the most sanguine bulls had hoped, Mohamed A. El-Erian writes for Bloomberg Opinion.

Blued’s new service connects men with overseas surrogates. Will China’s government mind?
The urge to have a child hit Geng Le hard after age 35. A former cop from China’s Hebei province, he’d launched a  gay dating app called Blued a couple of years earlier, in 2012, and had become something of an icon for the Chinese LGBT community. Still, he felt his life was somehow incomplete without a child and that he owed it to his parents to sire a new generation.
The next question was how to go about it. A friend had become a parent to triplets via surrogate, but that seemed sketchy because surrogacy is illegal in China. Another option was Thailand, a popular, relatively low-cost option, but by 2015 that country had banned foreign surrogacy. Geng decided on California, which offered the best legal protections for “intended parents” such as himself, excellent advanced medical care for the surrogate and the newborn, and a U.S. passport for the baby. “I thought about how the child, after it was born, might feel a lot of pressure, experience prejudice, feel insecure—‘other people have mothers, I don’t have a mother,’ ” he says. “But he’d have U.S. citizenship, so I could send the kid to study overseas.”
The surrogacy process was a long drumbeat of tests, contract signings, and administrative details. When the due date came around, Geng flew to Los Angeles for the birth and held his son for the first time. “I was just a person, I was used to that,” he says. “After you become a father, you experience this love and this responsibility.” He returned home with his son, Xiao Shu, in March 2017.
He also brought back a new idea for Blued: an overseas surrogacy service for gay men. The app was doing well, on its way to building up 40 million users and more than $130 million in venture capital; he figured many of the people on Blued would be willing to pay if the system could be made easier to navigate. A few months later, he launched Bluedbaby.
The service, part of a larger strategy of diversifying into new business lines for the LGBT community, has seen modest success. Blued has its eyes on an initial public offering—ideally in the U.S., which offers a simpler IPO process and deeper capital markets. The trick for Geng will be convincing investors that he can expand his operations in a country where gay people have few legal protections and where every new service pushes the frontiers of government tolerance and social acceptance.
Not so long ago, Geng was known by his birth name, Ma Baoli, and was married to a woman. But online, he was living a parallel life as Geng Le, creator of an increasingly popular website for gay men. In 2012 local media exposed his offline identity. When his superiors told him he could stay on the police force if he shut down the site, he decided to resign. In a country where stable government jobs are highly prized, the news that he was quitting horrified his parents. Their distress was compounded when they realized he was gay.
His life transformed, Geng decided to double down on his online venture and launch a smartphone app. It was promising enough that, two years after it was released, Shunwei Capital and DCM invested a total of $30 million. At the time, Blued had fewer than 40 employees, no revenue, and no business plan, recalls David Chao, a DCM co-founder and general partner. What it did have was online traffic from a sizable community that, outside of urban centers such as Beijing and Shanghai, remained isolated and hidden. The wager was based on demographics. “We believe that all human beings are alike, so China, with 1.4 billion people, could potentially have 140 million LGBT members,” he says. “Hence you have a large enough community to support an entire economy of its own.”
Chao’s 10 percent estimate might be too high—recent studies suggest that a lower percentage of people are gay—but in a country as populous as China, the market is still well into the tens of millions. Gay consumers are also wealthier consumers, says Eric Huet, a general partner at Ventech China Ltd., which invested in Blued in 2016. He estimates that in China they have five times the spending power of straight people, because they tend to have better jobs and no children (at least for now). And then there’s the international market; Geng estimates that two-fifths of Blued’s 40 million users are overseas. The company doesn’t disclose financial figures, but he says the domestic business has been profitable for the past two years.
A few days before Chinese New Year in February, Geng leads a reporter on a tour of Blued’s headquarters in east Beijing. On the street below, workmen on rickety scaffolding are putting up signs for a Bluedbaby shop front, intended to advertise the service and give clients and staff a place to talk, away from the bustle of the main operation a floor above. The offices upstairs are adorned with rainbow flags, posters from global pride parades, and vivid murals depicting cartoon men (and a few women) wearing lab coats, hard hats, rainbow rocket packs, or mermaid fins. The current meeting room for Bluedbaby clients features a cardboard cutout of two young fathers embracing a burbling baby. Geng waves at a clutch of lawyers who’ve come to discuss IPO plans, his “Just Do It” T-shirt contrasting with their dark suits.
Blued, like other dating apps, uses geolocation to help men find dates and connect with friends. Its most popular and lucrative service allows users to broadcast videos that followers can reward with virtual gifts and money; Blued then takes a cut. The app also brings in money from traditional advertising. In addition to Bluedbaby, the company is trying to get into the pharmaceuticals market by applying for a license to market PrEP, an  HIV-prevention drug regimen. Geng, who’s on PrEP himself, says it’s impossible to get the drug in most Chinese cities, and it’s very expensive when available. The eventual plan is to market and sell it directly to Blued users and to leverage its sales power to negotiate lower prices.
The company’s investors have suggested to Geng that he develop his diversification plans more before taking the company public. He says he hopes to have a $1 billion valuation by the end of the year—an ambitious target, to be sure. “The biggest difference between us and other companies listing is our ideals and beliefs,” he says. “We want to showcase a Chinese company diligently serving the LGBT community, showing that we do things with value, with philanthropy. That’s what I want to do the most.”
There’s some irony for Geng that, as he’s worked to promote Bluedbaby, he hasn’t been living with his son. Xiao Shu is in Geng’s hometown of Qinhuangdao, about 190 miles east of Beijing, being cared for by Geng’s partner and parents. He video chats with Xiao Shu frequently and visits when he can. The air quality and lifestyle are better in Qinhuangdao, Geng says, and his parents are overjoyed to have their grandson with them. He credits his son with helping mend family ties; his mother was so shocked to learn he was gay, he recalls, that she fell seriously ill.
His experience with the surrogacy came to inform Bluedbaby. Hoping to have twins, he’d chosen for the surrogate to be implanted with two embryos. When only one came to term, he regretted not working with a second surrogate, a surer but more expensive bet. Bluedbaby shepherds clients through such choices, connecting them with steps such as choosing an egg donor, finding a surrogate, signing contracts, and navigating American culture. (Among other differences, Chinese custom often dictates that pregnant mothers stay inside and eschew computers, nail polish, and sex.) Three employees in L.A. book hotels, pick up clients at the airport, and help get them around the city. Fees for Bluedbaby can run to thousands of dollars, on top of what clients pay directly to fertility clinics and egg donation and surrogacy agencies. Geng estimates he paid $200,000 to such providers for his own child.
Bluedbaby tries to eliminate some of the uncertainty inherent in the surrogacy process, he says. But there are contingencies no company can claim to prevent, such as miscarriages or stays in a neonatal intensive care unit. And for Chinese would-be parents, there’s the uncertain legal climate back home. Going abroad to have a baby by surrogate isn’t specifically banned, but China  limits the amount each citizen can send offshore each year to $50,000, making transfers to providers difficult.
There’s also risk after the child is born. China maintains an  arcane system of residency permits, or hukou, which determine where children can get public schooling and health care. Parents have no standard process to ensure that babies borne by overseas surrogates get these permits, raising the hugely expensive prospect that, as “foreigners” with a U.S. passport, the children will someday have to attend international schools.
Still, the profit margins and potential demand are promising, and Geng expects Bluedbaby to be making money by the second half of this year. During the interview prior to the Chinese New Year, he describes the holiday period, known as  Spring Festival, as a difficult time for the LGBT community, and an illustration of the need for a service such as his. “If, like me, you’re in your 40s and you still haven’t married, you still don’t have children, how can you face your parents, how can your parents face their friends?” Geng says, describing the holiday stress the LGBT community faces. “The regret is that your life isn’t complete enough. The second regret is that you owe a debt to your parents.”
Bluedbaby wouldn’t make any of the clients it has signed up available for an interview, citing privacy concerns, but other gay men who’ve sought out international surrogates recount similar motivations. One, a 37-year-old marketing specialist for an international company who asked to be identified only by his English name, Russell, worked with a California agency called Los Angeles Surrogacy to arrange an egg donor and a surrogate for the child he’s planning to raise with his partner of five years. Family pressure, he agrees, was a major motivation. “I’m thinking maybe I can just skip the step, skip marriage, just to babies—that’s much easier for me,” he says. He’s already hatching a story about a girlfriend leaving him with the baby.
Russell is exactly the kind of client Bluedbaby is targeting, though he hadn’t heard of the new venture when he started looking around. He expresses surprise on hearing that Blued is openly promoting a surrogacy business. “That’s a very controversial thing,” he says. “Our government is very communist. You don’t know what they’re going to do in the future. Maybe one day they’ll say, ‘OK, we have to stop this. You cannot do surrogate babies in China and you cannot promote it.’ What do you do?”
It’s not illegal to be gay in China, and the days when the police would round up men who met surreptitiously in parks and charge them with “hooliganism” are mostly gone. Homosexuality was removed from an official list of mental disorders in 2001. On the other hand, China has no explicit legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And the government has in recent years broadly suppressed civil society groups, including ones that promote gay rights, according to Darius Longarino, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center.
“Advocates in China don’t think the government is targeting LGBT issues per se,” he says, “but they are wary of any form of organization where people are finding each other and trying to create movements.” A few years ago, for example, one of the biggest apps for China’s lesbian community, Rela, was shut down following an event in Shanghai aimed at raising awareness of gay rights. (It later relaunched.) There’s also been some retrenchment of rules relating to public depictions of homosexuality. In 2016 the government banned portrayals of “abnormal” sexual behavior, including homosexuality, on Chinese television. The next year a government-affiliated group issued similar rules for online content, leading some platforms to  ban anything gay-themed.
Geng’s approach has been to cultivate relationships with officials and work assiduously to align Blued with public-health objectives such as HIV prevention and education. And when controversy has erupted, he’s managed to make his points to officials without drawing their ire. After the online content rules were issued, for example, he didn’t comment publicly, despite  uproar in the gay community. Instead, he reached out to one of the officials responsible, who explained that he’d applied the TV rules without realizing what would happen. Geng framed it as a business issue, and suggested that next time there be opportunity for public comment. In January, when rules were issued for short-video platforms on subjects ranging from criticisms of the Communist Party to foot fetishes, they didn’t single out homosexuality. Geng considers it progress.
Connecting gay men to surrogates is an especially challenging business, he acknowledges. It’s politically complex, high-touch, and slow compared with most e-commerce. Still, it’s coming along. Blued has so far helped a few dozen clients get to the U.S., and Geng anticipates good news within weeks. One of the surrogates is due on April 9. The first Bluedbaby baby is coming soon.

The ministry is weighing the sale of an 8.5 percent stake in Ecopetrol, worth about $3.6 billion. CEO Felipe Bayon said such a sale could take as long as two years to complete, and said the company is generating value for the government, which currently owns 88.5 percent of it.
Felipe Bayon
“I don’t think there’s a need right now to do the sale,” Bayon said Wednesday, in an interview in New York.
The government of President Ivan Duque is struggling to comply with tough fiscal deficit targets at the same time it deals with the costs of a migration crisis from neighboring Venezuela, as well as the expense of implementing programs from the 2016 peace accord with Marxist rebels. Selling part of Ecopetrol would help the government avoid cuts to public investment programs.
At a lunch with investors and analysts in New York last month, Duque said that he didn’t see the need to sell a stake in the company at this stage, according to Bayon. Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla said in an interview with Blu Radio in January that he would support the idea, and that he thought President Ivan Duque also backed it.
The head of Duque’s press office, Carlos Cortes, didn’t reply to an email seeking comment.
Bayon also said he didn’t see the need for a spinoff of Ecopetrol’s pipeline unit, CENIT. The company will generate a lot of value if Colombia’s moves into unconventional production are successful, he said.
“We want to actually increase the volumes from 1.1 to 1.25 million barrels. Ebitda margins are very good, 75 to 80 percent,” he said. “This is a very good piece of the business. Why would you want to sell it?""
Bayon said there was no political pressure on the company to issue a special dividend this year, which was taken due to the company’s strong financial position. The government is “extremely respectful” in its dealings with the company, and didn’t ask the company to take on debt to keep dividends up in 2015, he added.
Ecopetrol is planning to invest between $12 billion and $15 billion in the next three years to boost production, including $500 million for fracking, which is contingent on the government approving licensing.
This is a modal window."

The first shipments of U.S. humanitarian aid for Venezuela arrived at the country’s western border Thursday, setting the stage for a clash with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, who has pledged to block the supplies.
Two trucks arrived in the Colombian border town of Cucuta, and took the supplies to a warehouse next to an unused bridge that connects the countries. More deliveries are expected soon, though the scale of the need is immense. The supplies will be sent into Venezuela next week, opposition lawmaker Gaby Arellano said in a phone interview.
Colombian police officers escort a truck believed to be transporting humanitarian aid in Cucuta, Colombia on Feb. 7.
Venezuela’s security forces used freight containers and a tanker trailer to cut off the span, and are patrolling the dry riverbed nearby.
Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan National Assembly leader recognized as the country’s rightful leader by more than 30 governments, is using the aid to pressure Maduro’s authoritarian regime and demonstrate his ability to help the masses. But Maduro has said the effort is a pretext for invasion, and there’s no sign that his armed forces will let the shipments through.
A gas tanker and shipping containers block the Tienditas International Bridge in Cucuta, Colombia.
Under Maduro’s failed socialist policies, Venezuela has sunk into a humanitarian crisis, and hunger is common in the once-wealthy petrostate. Children beg for scraps and adults pick through garbage hoping to feed their families.
U.S. sanctions on the oil industry, the government’s only real source of hard currency, threaten further suffering. Those regulations, which were rolled out last week, are part of a two-pronged approach by Guaido and his U.S. backers -- strip Maduro of cash to buy even the small amounts of food he’s been handing out to Venezuelans, and then ride to the rescue with critical supplies of their own.
Nicolas Maduro
The U.S., Canada and European Union have pledged $100 million in aid at Guaido’s behest. That represents only about two weeks of food and medical imports, said Francisco Rodriguez, chief economist at Torino Economics in New York.
Guaido has said supplies will come through Colombia, Brazil and a Caribbean island, but the initial flash point is at the Cucuta bridge. The opposition will find a way to bring aid in, roadblocks or not, said Congresswoman Manuela Bolivar, a member of Guaido’s Popular Will party who is helping coordinate the plan.
“Venezuela is not an island. There are trails, and thousands of kilometers of territory that the aid could enter through, and we’re also looking at maritime options,” she said in an interview. “You have to generate pressure.”
Humanitarian agencies have been wary, because they say relief should be without any agenda. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday that help should arrive without strings.
“When we see the present standoff, it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary,” he said. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives.”
On Thursday morning, hundreds of Venezuelan families flowed over Cucuta’s bridges across the Tachira River.
Some dragged empty suitcases, planning to stock up on staples such as rice and chicken in Cucuta’s supermarkets. Others were leaving Venezuela for good. At the end of the Simon Bolivar Bridge, some get straight onto buses to make the 900-mile trip to Ecuador. Street hawkers offer packets of ibuprofen, acetaminophen and generic Viagra, all difficult to obtain back home.
It isn’t clear how aid deliveries will cross the border in the other direction. While Cucuta has two bridges open to foot traffic, the now-blocked Las Tienditas highway bridge is empty: By the time it was finished, relations between Colombia and Venezuela had deteriorated so much that it isn’t used. The aid shipments seem unlikely to inaugurate traffic.
Juan Guaido
The Red Cross’s Venezuela chapter said this week it is willing to distribute aid but wouldn’t bring food and medicine into the country in defiance of Maduro. Mario Villarroel, the organization’s president, spoke to reporters in Caracas about the group’s “fundamental principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence.”
Cucuta has been swamped by Venezuelan migrants, but Colombia’s National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement that the aid wouldn’t be distributed there.
Meanwhile, time is of the essence. As the U.S. oil sanctions imposed Jan. 28 start to bite, the country will face grave difficulties importing food and the gasoline with which to distribute it, Torino’s Rodriguez said.
Venezuela faces “a very serious risk of famine in the near term,” he said.

Originally published by Cara Barrett on Hodinkee.
While most people in the watch world have been lusting lately after Paul Newman's Paul Newman Daytona, I have been dreaming of a different watch. Don't get me wrong, Paul Newman's Paul Newman is probably  the coolest collectible watch, almost by definition. Paul Newmans after all are a big reason we even have a vintage Rolex market to begin with, but for me there is another watch on the market that speaks to my soul far more than the Daytona. I'm talking about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' Cartier Tank watch. 
Much like Paul Newman's Paul Newman, Jackie's (yes, in my mind we are now on a first name basis) Cartier Tank is not so much about the watch itself, but more about the person and time that it represents. Newman, a ruggedly handsome and salt-of-the-earth kind of guy, wore his Daytona daily and casually, before gifting it to his daughter's boyfriend. He used it for the purpose of telling time, and timing his car races (because that is what watches are actually for). Similarly, Jackie O. likely wore her watch as a means to tell time, for sentimental reasons, and well, because it looked great with her oversized glasses and pillbox hats. 
It is no secret that the Cartier Tank is one of the most elegant watch designs of all time, and is possibly one of the most recognized timepieces – all this making it one of the most iconic timepieces ever produced. In turn, it is also no secret that Jackie O. is one of the most iconic women to ever exist. In fact, some (cough, me) could argue that she is the most iconic woman to ever exist, which makes this watch, her watch, the most iconic ladies' watch ever.  
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (née Bouvier) was born in 1929 in Southampton, New York. She, along with her sister Caroline ""Lee"" Bouvier, grew up in a privileged household, with their parents divorcing in 1940. Jackie, as she was known to friends, graduated from George Washington University (after transferring from Vassar College) and lived and worked in Washington D.C. as a photographer for the Washington Times-Herald. 
It was during this time she met Congressman John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in May 1952. Kennedy later became Senator of Massachusetts that year and proposed to Jackie. They were married in 1953. The Kennedys went on to become an American power couple – JFK became President of the United States in 1961, with Jackie as his First Lady. Jackie was elegant, poised, and well-spoken, despite suffering from personal hardship. And while their marriage may be sometimes portrayed as less than perfect, it was a love story for the books. Sadly, her life took a tragic and unexpected turn with JFK's assassination, on November 22, 1963.
After the assassination, Jackie went on to raise Caroline and John Jr. and re-married – to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968. Throughout the remainder of her life, Jackie was known as a style icon and as one of the chicest women to ever live. Always classic and never trendy, she embodied American glamour and her style remains relevant today. I, for one, have always admired her style, strength, and grace, so you can imagine what a thrill it was for me to hold something that was once hers. 
This Tank was a gift to Jackie from her brother-in-law Prince Stanislaw Radziwill, who was married to her sister Caroline Lee Bouvier at the time. It was given to commemorate a 50-mile walk that the family had completed (Jackie and JFK only participated partially) in Palm Beach. The inscription on the caseback reads ""Stas to Jackie / 23 Feb. 63 / 2:05 AM to 9:35 PM,"" in script. Much like Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" campaign, the 50-Mile Walk was a program initiated by President John F. Kennedy to encourage the American people to get out and exercise. The call to action soon became all the rage and it still continues to this day in parts of the world.
After receiving this watch as a gift, Jackie wore it constantly, and it has been documented in many photographs. In honor of the walk, Jackie painted a small drawing of Stanislaw Radziwill and  Chuck Spalding (a close friend of JFK, who had campaigned for him and who did the whole 50 miles along with Radziwill) – which to me might be the cherry on top of the ice cream sundae.
The watch itself is exactly what I dreamed it would be. Petite and patinated, this Cartier Tank has the familiar glow and nostalgic feel of your grandmother's gold jewelry. It is clear that she wore it often. The case is compact, measuring 20mm wide by 28mm long. The corners have been smoothed down and the cabochon sapphire crown is in the more traditional shape for the Tank, which was unusual for that time period, as Cartier was experimenting with more geometric crown shapes. 
I cannot confirm this, but it is rumored that there were only three of this exact case made. But seeing as there are so many Cartier Tanks from this time period, it is hard to say. What I do know is I could not find this exact example in any reference book, and neither could Christie's – so it is definitely rare.
The dial is a familiar silver with fat, black Roman numerals and blued steel hands. It is signed Cartier France on the dial and on the caseback, along with the case number 44374. While this would usually imply the watch was sold in Paris, it was in fact sold in the New York boutique in 1962, which is further confirmed by the OYP import stamp on the manual-winding movement. As I've already mentioned, the caseback has the inscription, ""Stas to Jackie / 23 Feb. 63 / 2:05 AM to 9:35 PM,"" in what I would assume is Stas' handwriting (Cartier used to do engravings in the purchaser's own handwriting). They used to make shutter watches in the shape of an envelope with the name and home address of the owner in their script on the front (like this one).
However, one of the coolest things about this watch is the fact that it still has Jackie's original lizard strap! As in, the last person this strap touched prior to sale could have been Jackie herself!
Thus it goes without saying that this watch was an incredible thing to hold and to see. It is incredibly rare to come across a timepiece that belonged to someone like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, let alone put it on my wrist (!). The watch and the painting will be up for sale at Christie's on June 21, 2017 in New York. The estimate is $60,000 to 120,000. (Editor’s Note: The watch sold for $379,500.) While this watch may be simpler than Paul Newman's Paul Newman (it is just a vintage Tank after all), it still has that magical connection to an amazing individual that everyone can relate to.

Emmanuel Momoh, the first owner of the Peace Diamond, on a trek to the pit where it was found.
From a pickup truck heading out of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s recent history is legible in the images that scroll beyond the passenger-side window. A hand-painted sign reading “Amputee Lodge” points to a structure serving victims brutalized by an 11-year civil war that ended in 2002. Next comes a billboard that says “Report Bribery,” a plea to resist the corruption blamed for siphoning away international relief funds and obstructing postwar recovery. A faded canvas banner—“Only You Can Stop Ebola”—is a tattered relic from a 2014 outbreak that killed thousands. As we ascend the hills on the city’s periphery, a glance in the rearview mirror reveals a thick brown stripe running down the face of a distant slope: the scar from a 2017 mudslide that devoured the homes of at least 3,000 people, killing more than 1,100 of them.
For a break from all this misfortune and calamity, stop looking out the window and focus on the man in the passenger seat of the truck.
His name is Emmanuel Momoh, and by general consensus, he’s the luckiest man in Sierra Leone. Until last year, Momoh, 44, wasn’t much different from anyone else in a country where more than 60 percent of the population lives on less than $1.25 per day. He cobbled together his living by selling peanut butter to stores in Kono District, a remote and mostly rural region in the country’s east, and by preaching at an outpost of the Deeper Life Bible Church. The village he called home, Koryardu, consists of 47 cinder block and mud houses, and it’s where he’s headed now.
Millions of years ago, volcanic eruptions oozed across the riverine valleys of eastern Sierra Leone, embedding diamonds into the soil. This geological endowment, first identified in 1930, has since generated billions of dollars in international sales. Closer to home, it’s sustained smuggling networks, fueled wars, and wounded the environment, all while bestowing no visible benefits upon Koryardu and other rural villages.
It has also made locals prone to long-shot gambling. If you have a shovel, you have a chance—that’s the mindset. In Koryardu almost all able-bodied residents have spent years digging, washing, and sifting sand and gravel. The World Bank reports that the artisanal mining sector is the country’s second-largest employer, after agriculture, providing work for between 300,000 and 400,000 people. The diamonds they find are usually tiny, better suited to industrial drill bits than wedding rings. Momoh started as an informally employed digger when he was a teenager, and for about a dozen years (minus a couple during the civil war, when he became a refugee in Guinea) he’d wade through muddy mining pools, digging for eight hours every day, usually finding nothing. In 2006, with a bit of money in his pocket from his peanut butter sales, he became a “supporter,” an organizer who hires a small team of diggers to search on his behalf.
Under an arrangement common in Kono, a supporter pays each of the diggers about $2.50 for eight hours of labor, laying claim to whatever they find. If diamonds are unearthed, the supporters take the stones to local gem brokers, who run conductivity tests to verify that they are indeed diamonds. In most cases, the brokers pay for the diamonds on the spot, and off the books. The supporters go home with a fraction of what the diamond will fetch as a polished gem—maybe 10 percent—and generally toss a few dollars to the diggers as a bonus.

Data: Paul Zimnisky, Roy Maconachie

In March 2017, one of the five diggers working for Momoh found a 709-carat rough diamond. To put that in perspective, the average diamond engagement stone in the U.S. weighs about 1 carat, roughly the same as a medium paper clip, and sells for about $6,000, according to industry surveys. This particular rock weighed about the same as a baseball or a D battery. Momoh wrapped it in a piece of white paper, stuffed it in a plastic bag, and recruited five trusted witnesses to accompany him to a local broker for verification. After the stone was tested, it was instantly clear to all present that it was a diamond and worth millions of dollars, maybe tens of millions.
Momoh could have sold it to the broker, in the process pocketing several hundred thousand dollars or so—a fortune by local standards. But he resisted the pressure to hand it over. Instead, he chose to take the diamond to federal mining authorities in Freetown so they could handle the sale. The government had never done such a thing, but Momoh believed that an aboveboard, government-supervised sale would net him a higher return, even after the feds took their share of taxes and fees. Some of those taxes, he believed, could be channeled back to Koryardu, which lacks electricity and running water.
The diamond eventually sold at auction last December in New York for $6.5 million—much less than Momoh initially expected, but more than enough to radically change his life. And that personal tale could have been the sole focus of a story such as this one. It would have plenty of fish-out-of-water scenes of Momoh adjusting to his new circumstances, shopping for houses, opening bank accounts. We’d see him on his first airplane ride, traveling to Belgium to watch experts analyze the stone before it went up for sale. There’d be descriptions of him shivering on the streets of Manhattan the day before the auction, his eyes widening as he walked through the showrooms of Cartier and Tiffany & Co. Maybe there’d be a section centering on his return home, where hundreds of people gathered to welcome the new celebrity. The story of the diamond would, in short, be the story of a humble man who won the lottery.
But Momoh’s jewel has assumed a significance that transcends his own experience. His decision to buck tradition and make an end run around local dealers is being cited as a pioneering prototype—one that might spark a wholesale reformation of Sierra Leone’s artisanal mining trade and help redeem an international diamond industry that has never quite shaken its reputation for ethical compromise and exploitation.
Those broader implications are the reason for Momoh’s trip to Koryardu, where he hopes to convince his neighbors that his model of diamond dealing will finally bring some of the benefits back to them. It could help Sierra Leone rewrite its contemporary history, replacing some of the tragic images with more hopeful signs—new streetlights, new schools, new hospitals. These hopes are palpable. They carry weight. The closer Momoh gets to Koryardu, the harder they press upon him.
The truck bounces across a muddy dirt road and plows through knee-deep standing water. A girl, maybe 10 years old, walks along the roadside, dragging a machete through the dirt while balancing a basket of vegetables on her head. The high elephant grass crowding the sides of the path eventually thins out, and Koryardu emerges. The residents stream out of their homes and converge on Momoh, eager to hear that the diamond’s promised benefits might be on the way.
“Wow, the pressure—unlimited pressure,” Momoh says later, admitting that he was frightened by the swarming intensity of the crowd. “Everyone has their own plan now because of this one diamond.”
Momoh’s stone hit the diamond market at a time of uncertainty, when the industry’s ethics were being attacked from more sides than they’d been in decades. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Sierra Leone’s civil war helped introduce the term “blood diamond” to the world, tarnishing the global trade by linking jewels to illegal arms deals and violent rebel groups. To save itself, the industry—along with the United Nations and civil society groups—created the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which would validate stones that originated from “legitimate sources” and were unsullied by conflict.
Those certificates helped restore consumer trust, but lately some of the same organizations that participated in the process have dismissed them as a failed experiment. The same week Momoh’s diamond was sold in New York, the nongovernmental organization Impact (formerly known as Partnership Africa Canada) became the second Kimberley Process co-founder to withdraw from the certification scheme, saying it had become a source of false confidence for consumers. That came on the heels of a temporary boycott of the Kimberley Process by a wider coalition of civil society groups, and of a mining conference in India at which Martin Rapaport, the founder of an influential diamond pricing index and trading network, delivered a speech concluding that the certifications he, too, had helped establish were simply “bullshit.” At the same time, the  rise of lab-grown diamonds, which are chemically identical to mined stones and free of their ethical and political complications, posed a new threat to traditional diamond businesses.
It was Rapaport who first latched onto Momoh’s diamond as a way to rehabilitate the industry. When Sierra Leone initially tried to auction the stone, it did so in Freetown, which in effect limited the sale mostly to regional buyers. It attracted only five bidders, and the government rejected the top offer, of a little more than $7 million, as less than fair value. The Rapaport Group, which is based in New York and Israel, stepped in and offered to organize, free of charge, a second auction in New York that catered to international buyers.
Rapaport has long been considered an important and disruptive player in the diamond world. For decades, diamonds were assumed to be wholly nonfungible—that is, each stone was unique, and therefore pricing could never be standardized, as it is with traditional commodities such as gold and silver. But in 1978, Rapaport began to publish a weekly list of current diamond prices, sorted according to categories such as size and clarity grading. By injecting a little transparency into a pricing system that had always been mysteriously opaque, he became an enemy to legions of traditional brokers. That enmity didn’t stop his weekly report from becoming the industry’s international pricing bible, and Rapaport’s business eventually expanded to include a diamond-grading service, an auction company that runs 40 events per year, and an online trading platform that lists billions of dollars’ worth of diamonds every day.
In Momoh’s diamond, Rapaport saw a chance to introduce something new and intangible into a stone’s pricing composition: moral value. Before the December auction, he dubbed the stone the Peace Diamond, and he assured potential buyers that Sierra Leone’s government would pour some of its share of the profits back into the village where it had been found. “The idea is that this is a diamond that makes the world a better place,” Rapaport says. “We’re transcending the commodity aspect—which is that it’s a beautiful diamond, and big, and all that stuff—by selling the idea behind the diamond, not just the diamond itself.”
The winning bid of $6.5 million came from Laurence Graff, a billionaire English jeweler. To most observers, it was a sputtering anticlimax, bringing in even less than the bid Sierra Leone had rejected. Dorothée Gizenga, executive director of the Canada-based NGO Diamond Development Initiative, says that Rapaport’s intentions were good, but they were ultimately misguided. “The Peace Diamond didn’t work,” she says.
But Rapaport didn’t let up after the auction. At the American jewelry industry’s largest annual expo and trade show in Las Vegas this summer, he delivered a blistering speech. About 51 percent of the world’s diamonds are sold in the U.S., he said, and an estimated 20 percent of those come from mostly unregulated artisanal miners. Many of those stones—even certified ones—were still being smuggled through black market channels before entering the legitimate market, he added, and were funding terrorism and crime.
“Wait a minute,” he told the audience. “If the diamonds were smuggled, who bought them?” He extended an index finger outward and waggled it. “You did. You did. You did. We did. But we don’t take responsibility for that. We hide in Rodeo Drive.”
Rapaport had recently sent two of his sons to Sierra Leone to visit the villages of Kono and explore with rural diggers and government officials whether a trading scheme based on the Peace Diamond model might be accepted. Instead of trying to sell “some Kimberley Process piece of crap,” he asked his Vegas audience, what if jewelers could assure consumers that proceeds from the diamond they were about to buy would find their way back to the African village where it had been found?
The answer, he later explained, was clear to him: “You could sell the hell out of that!”
Ezi Rapaport, Martin’s 32-year-old son, spent much of early August inside the Radisson Blu Mammy Yoko hotel in Freetown. During the war, the building served as headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, until rebel forces seized it; today it’s the only international chain hotel in the country, which has made it a business hub. Rapaport held court in its patio restaurant. Politicians, entrepreneurs, entertainers, trade officials from the U.S. embassy, NGO directors, Miss Sierra Leone—if they were even mildly influential, he scheduled meetings with them. He’d tell them he was betting on the future of Sierra Leone, repeating a smoothly polished talking point: “We believe the real diamonds of Sierra Leone are the people.”
The Rapaports are Orthodox Jews, and Martin says that institutionalizing the Peace Diamond model in Sierra Leone would be an example of tikkun olam, a kabalistic concept that translates roughly as “repair of the world.” Essentially, it’s the idea that Jews should work to benefit the world at large, not only their own communities. This, and the family’s connection to Israel, is worth mentioning in part because many of the local buyers in Kono who acquire rough stones from diggers—the people the Peace Diamond model would disrupt most directly—are of Lebanese descent. For years, Martin has complained that some of the money entering the black market from West Africa’s artisanal mining trade ends up funding terrorist organizations. Intelligence reports from Western countries and testimony in the trials of al-Qaeda members support this.
The model the Rapaports envision would let diggers and supporters take their stones directly to a countrywide network of auction houses, which the Rapaport Group would help set up. The company generally takes a 5 percent commission for its auctions, according to Ezi; in Sierra Leone, this would be reduced or eliminated. Sales would be regularly scheduled and broadcast online to bidders from around the world. The national government would take a big cut of the sales, as much as 60 percent, leaving 40 percent with the miners (proportions that are technically already on the books for exported diamonds, but are often disregarded, leaving the government with nothing). Additionally, the government would be required by law to spend at least a quarter of its share on projects in the community where the diamond was found. These are the terms Momoh ultimately accepted for the sale of his diamond.
One day, Rapaport left the confines of the Radisson and made the rounds of Freetown’s government buildings, hoping to drum up political support for the plan. Morie Manyeh, the minister of mines and mineral resources, listened with interest as Rapaport outlined the auction idea at his ministry. Manyeh grew up digging for diamonds himself, and he’s convinced that the “resource curse”—the notion that small countries blessed with natural resources end up suffering as a result—is real. He guessed that local miners would embrace the auction idea but pointed out that their relationships with local buyers sometimes spanned decades and extended to informal loans. “The diggers can in difficult times go back to those people and say, ‘You remember I sold my diamonds to you? Well, my son is sick,’ ” he explained. “And they will give them a little something. That does not happen if you go to the government.”
Rapaport next visited Samuel Koroma, the acting director of the National Minerals Agency, which oversees Kimberley Process certifications in Sierra Leone and enforces mining and mineral export regulations. In a steamy office building full of scales and loupes and filing cabinets, Rapaport told Koroma that instead of trying to register, license, and monitor every artisanal digger in Kono, he should instead encourage them to sell directly to the government, as Momoh had. The idea didn’t land well; it was as if he’d told a lifelong drug enforcement officer to turn a blind eye to drug deals as long as the police department was getting a cut.
“Then you’re just making everyone illicit!” Koroma said.
Rapaport placed his hands on the table. “To tell you the truth, that’s not that bad,” he said. “It’s better for the government if nobody has licenses, and everybody pays 40 percent.”
The same day, Rapaport toured the offices of some other parliamentarians, several of whom posed a common question: Why should Sierra Leone listen to the Rapaport Group, whose auction for the Peace Diamond attracted a winning bid that was less than the one the government got and rejected?
“Well, now, that’s a very interesting question,” Rapaport answered. Making a bid wasn’t the same as delivering the payment, he said. That initial bidder had offered only $3.5 million when the diamond was put up for sale in New York. “I’d be surprised if they would have gotten the money,” Rapaport said. It isn’t unusual for local auctions to produce bogus bids. “And where did the money come from? Maybe it’s black market money. Maybe there’s a reason he wants to clean his money. I don’t know.”
But lobbying politicians could take Rapaport only so far. The diggers had to buy into the concept, and for that to happen, they had to see, and not simply be told, that a new method of selling would deliver benefits.
“The people of Koryardu, of the Kono District at large, want to see tangible development,” Saa Emerson Lamina, the chairman of Parliament’s mining committee, said. “Nothing else will satisfy them.”
To get to the mining pits where the diamond was found, Momoh trudges down a steep trail that’s been hacked out of the forest. Rapaport and several dozen villagers follow behind. Momoh brushes past ferns, carefully jumps over an advancing column of biting ants, crosses slick and mossy boulders in a shallow stream, and blindly tromps on a rubbery black centipede shining in the mud. The brisk hike takes about 25 minutes.
A few diggers stand in one of the pits, wading in cloudy brown water and sifting gravel in sluice pans. One of the villagers accompanying Momoh and Rapaport carries a video camera, and another hefts a large speaker, which he places on the pit’s sandy lip. Music starts blasting, and five men begin dancing in a tight group, flashing poses and hand signals before the camera.
“They’re shooting a music video,” Rapaport says. He’d gotten in touch with them during a previous visit to the country and encouraged them to come up with a song that might promote the Peace Diamond idea. He nods toward a man lip-syncing into a dead mic. “They’re the communicators around here—the musicians. They’re an important part of getting the message out.”
The men encourage Rapaport to step into the frame with them. He consents, swaying to the music and gamely testing a few moves while one of the vocalists mugs for the camera and raps: Rapaport family says we are the diamonds.No more blood diamonds!Wanna tell you ’bout the Peace Diamond!We are the diamond!Wanna celebrate the Peace Diamond!Rapaport family, thank you for everything.Rapaport family, thank you for coming to rescue me! 
During a pause in the filming, Rapaport offers some lyrical advice. “You gotta reduce all that ‘Rapaport’ stuff,” he tells the singer. “More about the people! The people!”
The music flares up again, and the performers resume dancing. Rapaport walks over to stand near Momoh, who watches the spectacle without expression. The rappers eventually surround the pastor, trying to coax him into the shot, but he stares straight ahead, his face a mask of determined noncompliance.
Frustration has been slowly building inside Momoh from the moment he arrived in Kono. Every time he visits his village, he’s met by neighbors who are increasingly impatient because the Peace Diamond still hasn’t paid off for them. They were told they’d get new roads, a medical center, a school. Momoh can’t help but feel that they hold him responsible for their disappointment.
The tour of the mining pits complete, Momoh leads the way back to the village, via a clearing where felled tree trunks lie in the dirt. A few workers wearing hard hats and reflective construction vests mill about, one wearing a T-shirt under his vest that says, “Jesus is Coming—Look Busy.” These men are employees of a Chinese company with which the government contracted to deliver the promised infrastructure improvements to Koryardu. Momoh notes that the workers have been clearing the area for months, and they’re still not done. In the dirt near the workers’ feet, there’s an empty foil sachet of Black Commando gin.
“The people are not pleased,” Momoh says.
His frustrations come to a head after a local teacher confronts him, angrily demanding to know what’s going on with the new school building. To find out, Momoh walks toward another would-be construction site. A partial cement-block perimeter wall, a foot or two high, is all he finds. No workers have touched the site for weeks, he’s told.
“It’s as if we’re begging!” he says, his deep voice rising, fraying a little at the edges. “And to be frank, with the money they have for this village, they could demolish the whole village and build it again! The money is there! I have seen all the documents! The money is there!”
Momoh’s patience has dissolved. “Where’s the foundation? This is the only school! There’s no other school besides this! They are taking advantage of the people here because they are just villagers. This is very bad!”
Rapaport tries to calm him, but concedes that the projects must move faster if other local diggers are ever going to follow Momoh’s example. “I’m telling the government that they have to be completely transparent and put up a picture and a sign saying exactly when the projects will be finished,” he says. “And they should buffer it up, manage expectations—allow enough time for them to actually be able to deliver. They can do this.”
That evening, Rapaport ventures into Koidu, a city about 45 minutes from Koryardu where the regional diamond trade is largely based. It’s a riot of raw capitalism, full of low-slung brokerage houses with barred windows and stores selling shovels and sluice pans. In the middle of it all he finds the Kay Marie Lounge, a darkened nightclub with a bright electric sign: THE HEARTBEAT OF KONO.
Inside, a dozen people gather in the sticky gloom of a VIP section. It’s an impromptu meeting of the leaders of the Kono District Miners Union, a syndicate with about 500 members, most of them artisanal diggers. Rapaport talks to them about the importance of ethics and transparency, and they tell him about how the local buyers—“cartels,” they call them—collude to underpay them for their stones. Rapaport outlines his plan to bring Peace Diamond-style auctions to Kono. “Maybe we could get a higher price for you than the cartels you have over here,” he says. They nod receptively. One woman, who says she represents the district’s female diggers, sounds almost desperate for help. “If you had an office here,” she tells him, “we would know we have somewhere to run to. To rescue us.”
When the diggers sell to the local brokers, they’re paid on the spot. If periodic internet-broadcast auctions were established here, the diggers would have to sit on their finds for a while until bids could be placed. “How long could people wait to get the international price?” Rapaport asks the room.
“That’s the thing,” says one of the miners. “We are hungry. We need to eat.” The man consults briefly with the others, and they settle on a time limit: two weeks, maximum.
Rapaport had been thinking a monthly auction would be about right. He tells them, “We have to be positive, we have to be persistent, but we also have to be patient.”
In the months since their company bought the Peace Diamond, the experts at Graff Diamonds have been peering deeply into the stone, noting its colors, charting its mazy imperfections, strategizing how to maximize its value. “As sometimes happens, the rough is extremely hard, so it takes more time and effort to cut,” says Graff, the purchaser. He’s hopeful a polished, premium-quality pear-shaped diamond larger than 100 carats can be extracted, along with numerous other smaller diamonds. The stones will be laser-inscribed, certified by the Gemological Institute of America, then displayed in Graff showrooms and at exhibitions around the world. The potential value that might come from the stone’s community-oriented backstory, Graff says, was one of the reasons he made the winning bid.
After the auction last December, the government promptly paid Momoh his share—about $2.5 million. Momoh paid his five diggers about $130,000 each. He also made similar contributions to Kono’s paramount chieftain and to the village chief, and he’s been paying tithes to his church. That’s left him, after taxes, with about $1 million, he says. So far, Momoh has invested mostly in real estate, buying three houses in three different regions of Sierra Leone. He also bought a plot of land near the house he bought in Freetown, where he has started to build a school.
Momoh and all the diggers he employed now spend most of their time in the capital city, not in the village. If anyone believes this amounts to a betrayal of their community, that person probably has no idea what life is like in Koryardu. “If I want to improve my life,” says Komba Johnbull, the 19-year-old who first spotted the diamond in the gravel, “then I can’t stay in my village. There would have been no way for me to further my education there.”
That might not be the case if the government finishes the village school. The day after he visited Koryardu, Momoh returned to Freetown in his truck and promptly got on the phone with federal mining officials, arguing that the pace of construction had to be addressed. They assured him, and later Rapaport, that the projects were going forward, the money was accounted for, and the government was committed to seeing this through. By late 2018 frustrations over the pace of building spurred the government to suspend the Chinese company’s contract, and it began reviewing the possibility of awarding the project to a different outfit. The Rapaports, for their part, installed solar electricity in a building in the village, with lights and cellphone charging stations for the residents.
Despite his occasional frustrations, Momoh seems the ideal ambassador for the auction project. He exudes self-assurance. He’s polite but doesn’t suffer fools. He speaks about everything that has happened to him in the past year from an impressively wide-angled and practical perspective. The worst thing he could do, he says, would be to blow his money on frivolous extravagances. His dream is to achieve financial self-sustainability through his school project, which would be financed through private tuitions. He could be a walking example of how to respond to good fortune. When he talks about his goals, they are always community-based, and most of them involve funneling benefits back to Koryardu.
There’s one project he dreams about, however, that isn’t strictly practical. In addition to the basic infrastructure projects that the government has started to build in Koryardu, Momoh would love to see something symbolic take shape.
He dreams of a clock tower. A structure of brick and stone that rises above everything else in Kono. Maybe the names of all those who buy Peace Diamond stones—starting with Laurence Graff—could be inscribed into a stone at its base. It would be a monument that everyone would pass every day, for generations.
The government has told him to forget the idea. He’s well aware that reasonable people can argue that Kono needs a lot of things before it needs a clock tower. But he’s not so sure it’s true.
“We need something that we can look at with pride,” he says. “A reminder of good things happening. We need to be reminded of that.”

When money and connections mean you can invest in just about anything, anywhere and over any time frame, what winds up in your portfolio?
Yes, the rich are buffeted by the same forces affecting everyone else: rising rates, trade wars and global populism. But in the rarefied world of ultra-high-net-worth investors, diversification doesn’t mean index funds or assembling a standard stock/bond/cash mix.
With prospects for equities uncertain, Bloomberg canvassed wealthy investors and advisers to find unusual opportunities in 2019 open to those with big fortunes and a taste for the exotic. Following is a sampling of the possibilities.
“The hedge funder’s new Ferrari” is not Italian, fast or even a car, according to financier-turned-art dealer Asher Edelman. It’s a high-octane financial maneuver tied to the sale of artwork that’s part insurance policy, part betting slip.
Offering a guaranteed minimum price to those putting fine art on the block has become standard at top auction houses. Sellers like knowing that works won’t go unsold. In return, if the art sells for more than the guarantee, some of the profit above the prearranged bid goes to the guarantor.
To offload risk, auction houses are negotiating more “irrevocable bids”—also known as “third-party guarantees”—with investors who may see it as a display of financial prowess. With the art market peaking, opportunities abound but carry greater risk and should be approached with caution.
The biggest profit for a guarantor was last year’s auction of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” at Christie’s. Guaranteed to sell for more than $100 million, the painting was hammered at $450 million. Philip Hoffman, founder of the London-based Fine Art Group, estimated that the guarantor made as much as $150 million.
For those on a tighter budget, a Chinese company  plans to finance the purchase of a $75 million Michelangelo painting by issuing 7.5 million restricted shares at $10 a pop. Yulong Eco-Materials Ltd. said it’s offering “the opportunity of its acquired masterpieces to anyone with a brokerage account.”
Some hedge fund managers are content with the “old” kind of Ferrari, as in a real one. But even so, there are Ferraris and then there are Ferraris.
A red 1962 250 GTO owned by technology executive Greg Whitten sold in August for a record $48.4 million. Just 36 were made. (And yes, it reportedly went to auction with a financial guarantee.)
More owners are buying and barely driving supercars because low mileage means a higher price later on, said Ferrari expert and racer Todd Morici. (He calls those cars “garage art.”) Vintage autos as a category returned 288 percent in the past decade, according to the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index, or more than twice that of the S&P 500 Index.
U.S. stocks have risen steeply, but Ferrari prices are up more this decade

Morici, 62, owns five Ferraris and builds collections for European and Middle Eastern buyers through his Morici Motor Sports LLC. Buying the right car is like buying the right stock, he said: “You can pay more to buy the best, because at the end, it will be worth more.”
Mere money won’t always get you one. Ferrari allows only clients who race in its motorsports program to buy the special edition 488 Pista Piloti. Morici has a Blu Tour De France Pista Piloti on order for $500,000.
In any case, buyers aren’t plunking down piles of cash. The line of credit Morici has with Ferrari enables him to borrow up to 70 percent of the appraised value at what he calls “a friendly rate.”
Weed is so 2018. Next year, cutting-edge investors are going psychedelic.
Those pushing boundaries aren’t wearing tie dye and driving VW buses, but are at work in the lab and treatment room. There’s a renewed wave of research and testing the use of hallucinogenic compounds, primarily psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms,” to alleviate treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and other conditions.
In the U.K., Compass Pathways has produced a synthetic version of psilocybin for a large-scale clinical trial launched in September. The trial is taking place in Europe and North America over the next year or so, with healthy volunteers taking the drug under the supervision of psychiatrists, according to the life sciences company.
“It just feels like a cultural shift going on,” said billionaire Mike Novogratz, who’s an investor in Compass Pathways. “It’s been around for thousands of years; people kind of know its side effects.”
Other backers include German investor Christian Angermayer and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Angermayer’s family office founded Atai Life Sciences AG, which is backing studies of psilocybin to treat depression and has a stake in Compass Pathways.
In the upper echelons of wealth, bespoke products abound, and that includes tailored investments.
A product Citigroup Inc.’s private bank may offer clients in 2019 is tied to the electric vehicle market. The firm’s analysts expect the majority of vehicles to be battery powered by 2030, and that the $22 billion industry will swell to $100 billion by 2025. While the consensus view is that the lithium-ion battery industry has low margins, Citigroup believes “very efficient manufacturers will generate higher profit margins over time,” said David Bailin, the unit’s chief investment officer.
Bailin envisions a security that would track the performance of seven stocks exposed to battery manufacturers and the mining of raw material used in their production. If projected price targets are reached, the portfolio would have a 36 percent average return over the first 12 months, Bailin said.
Buyers will get their initial investment back at maturity, while receiving 70 percent of any performance gains. The fee on a five-year note would be 1.75 percent.
“Clients can choose when to get in but won’t be taking a significant capital risk if the note-writer pays it off at maturity,” Bailin said.
For most entrepreneurs, the business they own or operate is their portfolio. For Steven Millstein, co-founder of Ridgewood, New Jersey-based Stro Cos., that means owning commercial real estate. While Amazon.com Inc.’s dominance has caused countless retail rivals misery, Millstein has seen a more felicitous effect: It has driven up rents for his warehouses.
“For me, the Amazon effect is primarily that 53 percent of sales on their platforms are from third-party sellers,” Millstein said. “Those sellers are often tenants in my buildings.”
Amazon’s decision to open a satellite headquarters in  Long Island City, New York, “was huge for us, and further justification for adding to this asset class,” Millstein said. Stro has about 2 million square feet and 26 buildings in Northern New Jersey and plans to add another in early 2019.
Millstein describes himself as “a generational owner” with no plans to sell. One measure of the return on his investment: “In the last few years, we’ve purchased buildings and within a year to three years were able to get all of our equity out through a refinance,” he said. “We have all of our risk off the table, and we coupon-clip going forward.”
Cryptocurrencies had a  horrid year, but there’s still a play for 2019 with the potential to do well in good and bad markets.
That’s the hope of investors in crypto-tax software startups, including San Francisco’s CoinTracker, Seattle’s ZenLedger and TaxToken. In a world where Bitcoin’s price has tumbled about 80 percent, it’s telling that the next product on ZenLedger’s agenda is a tax-loss-harvesting tool.
Tracking capital gains and losses in crypto can be a nightmare, even for accountants, and the Internal Revenue Service has stepped up its enforcement actions. The agency looked into how many Form 8949s, where taxpayers report dispositions of capital assets, had property descriptions it deemed “likely related to Bitcoin.” The answer: a paltry 800 or 900 annually for the years 2013 through 2015, which is likely understated.
Vestigo Ventures, Castle Island Ventures and Initialized Capital are among the investors who have backed some of the startups.
The wealthy have the luxury of being able to buy what they love, even if the payoff isn’t immediately apparent. For Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder of  Tiger 21, an investment network for the rich, that means bulk estates of photographers, including those connected with iconic images of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley.
Purchases typically run into the millions of dollars and can include cameras, lenses, tripods, thousands of photos, and undeveloped rolls of film and video, along with the potential to license the images. “You need a 20-year plan to think of how you build a world-class photo collection,” Sonnenfeldt said.
One of Sonnenfeldt’s purchases was the estate of Hungarian-American fashion photographer Andre de Dienes, who Sonnenfeldt said “literally discovered Marilyn Monroe” after she was sent to him as a 19-year-old model for a photo series he was shooting of nudes.
Sonnenfeldt got thousands of photos, including many prints of Monroe from age 19 to 24, the intellectual property rights, book rights and negatives. More recently, he bought the bulk estate of Alfred Wertheimer, known for a famous photo of a young Elvis Presley kissing a girl backstage.
“If you go to the licensing convention in Las Vegas, the three most iconic images of the 20th century are Elvis, Marilyn Monroe and Muhammad Ali,” Sonnenfeldt said.

60	BLU	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-12/tobacco-stocks-drop-on-concern-fda-plans-strict-nicotine-rules	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-12/tobacco-stocks-drop-on-concern-fda-plans-strict-nicotine-rules	October 12, 2018, 5:53 AM EDT	Tobacco Stocks Drop on Concern FDA Plans Strict New Rules	"British American Tobacco Plc and Imperial Brands Plc led cigarette stocks lower on concern the U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to propose strict limits on the amount of nicotine in traditional cigarettes.
Research shows that reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes by as much as 96 percent would improve public health, Lynn Hull, a pharmacologist at the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, said Thursday in a webcast summary of recent studies on the matter. BAT fell as much as 5.4 percent and Imperial declined as much as 7 percent before paring some losses.
The lecture, preceded by a disclaimer that it doesn’t formally represent the FDA’s position, sparked speculation that tough measures may be on the way. The agency said in March it plans a proposal on nicotine reduction, though analysts say it will take years to implement.
“Making all cigarettes minimally addictive could significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by smoking,” Hull said.
With an estimated 480,000 deaths due to smoking related causes each year in the U.S., FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is developing a plan to change regulation over traditional cigarettes and new alternatives to smoking.
The presentation “demonstrates that the FDA is committed to building a body of evidence to support its nicotine reduction agenda,” Pamela Kaufman, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in note to clients. The next step is for the agency to publish its proposal, she said. Hull declined to comment in her presentation on when that might be.
Hull also summarized findings from a paper the Center for Tobacco Products published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March. Assuming nicotine limits are implemented in 2020, the study forecast the measures would prevent 33 million people from starting to smoke and 8 million deaths by 2100.
The new rules may increase the use of noncombustible nicotine alternatives after they’re implemented, but overall consumption should decline over time, Hull said. Studies also show that a sudden reduction in nicotine levels won’t lead smokers to compensate by smoking more, she added.
Both BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes, and Imperial, which manufactures Winston, erased some of their early declines, with the former down 1.5 percent at noon in London and the latter dropping 4.4 percent.
Altria Group Inc. shares closed 2.9 percent lower Thursday. The FDA webcast took place at noon New York time that day.
Some analysts said the presentation only repeated previous statements and summarized past studies.
“There is really nothing to see here,” wrote Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies, who said that while some concern is understandable, the research doesn’t include any studies with independent data-gathering. The estimates of public health gains by 2100 were published in June, he added.
Cutting nicotine to the levels cited by Hull would require difficult, expensive genetic modification of tobacco plants, Bennett wrote. Still, some companies claim a big reduction is possible, including 22nd Century Group Inc., which is developing strains of tobacco with less nicotine.

Tobacco stocks are rallying the most in a decade following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s announcement that it’s cracking down on e-cigarettes in an effort to combat youth vaping.
Altria Group and British American Tobacco gained the most intraday since 2008, rising as much as 7.7 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. Philip Morris rose the most in more than three years. The agency has asked that the five top-selling national e-cigarette brands submit plans on how they will address youth access and use of their products.
Tobacco investors have grown increasingly concerned that the widespread popularity of e-cigarettes is having a negative impact on the old-school industry, a headwind expected to grow as its products from companies like Juul continue gaining traction with consumers. Big tobacco has yet to find a productive way to meaningfully compete against Juul, making the FDA’s move a positive for the companies, according to Cowen analyst Vivien Azer.
If the ban were to happen, Altria Group is mostly likely to benefit, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in the note today.
“Given the market’s overarching concerns about Juul’s impact on cigarettes, especially Marlboro, we think a potential ’ban’ on Juul would be positive for MO,” Herzog wrote.
Jefferies is also bullish on how the FDA’s actions will affect major tobacco players.
“Anything that slows down Juul market share is a positive and this is what we think we will see in all possible outcomes around the ’60-day’ action,” Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said in reference to the 60-day window the FDA is giving manufacturers to submit their plans.
The five brands the FDA has addressed are: Juul, Vuse, MarkTen XL, blu e-cigs and Logic."

Within hours of Uber thumbing its nose at a pending California labor law that could upend its business model, the Boston-based lawyer filed yet another lawsuit against the ride-hailing giant, part of her campaign to make gig-economy businesses pay their workers better.
Until now, Liss-Riordan has had limited success. Uber came out unscathed from a marathon battle she began in 2013, ending this year with a $20 million settlement allowing the company to keep classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.
But this time, Liss-Riordan may have more leverage. This week, California lawmakers approved Assembly Bill 5, which guarantees workers employee status if their duties are in the usual course of a company’s business. The measure may force companies to start paying a minimum wage and overtime, and to provide benefits such as sick leave and health insurance.
Uber’s chief legal officer, Tony West, said Wednesday that the company would carry on the legal fight in defense of its position that drivers are contractors. Uber will continue to argue that its core business is technology, not transportation, meaning that its drivers won’t qualify as employees under the law’s new criteria, he said.
Those combative comments are what prompted Liss-Riordan to take on the company again in court.
“It was somewhat stunning that a company would be so defiant, with a state that has strongly stated that workers need to be protected,” she said Thursday in an interview. “Having dealt with Uber for many years, not surprised in a way, but it was stunning they would say that blatantly.”
All eyes are now on Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat elected last year who was expected to sign the bill into law but on Wednesday was reportedly still open to negotiating with Uber and its rival Lyft Inc. regarding possible exemptions from the legislation.
Liss-Riordan has specialized for 20 years in litigating on behalf of low-wage workers in a variety of industries, from exotic dancers to truckers. She has become the gig economy’s chief antagonist in court, at one point opening an office in California while fighting with Uber, Lyft and other Bay Area-based startups that rely on a casual workforce to keep costs down.

She has also leveraged her status as a labor advocate to get into politics, now campaigning to take on U.S. Senator Ed Markey in the Massachusetts Democratic primary next year.
The case that Liss-Riordan brought against Uber in 2013 posed a threat to the company when she won class-action status to represent as many as 385,000 drivers in California and Massachusetts. That momentum was undone by an appeals court ruling last year that allowed Uber to force the vast majority of those workers into arbitration. That whittled the class down to about 13,600 drivers who were eligible for the $20 million settlement reached in March.
As recently as early May, Uber was facing more than 60,000 complaints filed by drivers in arbitration over their classification as contractors, including many brought by Liss-Riordan’s law firm. Just before the company’s initial public offering, Uber said it had settled “a large majority’ of those claims for between $146 million and $170 million.
Liss-Riordan’s new complaint in San Francisco federal court was filed Wednesday as a class action on behalf of all California drivers. An Uber spokesman on Thursday had no immediate comment on the complaint.
Liss-Riordan said she’s counting on recent court rulings, including one Wednesday from a Philadelphia federal appeals court, to get around Uber’s argument that drivers are barred by their arbitration agreements from suing as a group.
AB 5, if signed by Newsom, would codify a 2018 California Supreme Court legal test for defining when a worker is an employee. Liss-Riordan said her new lawsuit could include hundreds of thousands of drivers going back four years if California judges determine the high court’s ruling applies retroactively.
Whether the new suit will take six years to resolve, like her last one against Uber, she couldn’t say.
“This is why I’m running for the U.S. Senate,” Liss-Riordan said. “People are sleeping in their car. Corporations are trampling on rights and working people need a voice. That’s why I’m running. This needs to be nationwide. That’s why I want to go to Washington.”
The case is McCray v. Uber Technologies Inc., 19-cv-5723, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., a maker of server computers, gave a profit forecast that topped Wall Street estimates, signaling progress on its efforts to cut costs and reshape its business to higher-margin products.
Adjusted earnings, excluding some items, will be 43 cents to 47 cents a share in the period ending in October, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected 43 cents. The company also raised its fiscal year forecast for adjusted earnings to $1.72 to $1.76 a share from its May guidance of $1.62 to $1.72.
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri has sought to prepare the hardware maker for a future increasingly defined by cloud-based software. HPE said in June that it would offer its products as a service, with servers, storage hardware, networking gear and software available through subscriptions or pay-per-use models by 2022.
Neri also formed a partnership with Google to help clients adopt a hybrid model and announced a $1.4 billion acquisition of Cray Inc. to bolster HPE in supercomputers. All the while, the CEO has tried to reduce the company’s spending to make it more profitable, especially with inconsistent sales growth due to weakening demand for servers and storage hardware.
“I would characterize the quarter as strong operational performance in an uneven market, driven by the macroeconomic challenges we’re all facing,” Neri said in an interview. “The trade escalation continues to create uncertainty. Customers take a little bit longer to decide their investment strategy.”
The hardware maker’s operating margin improved by 1.1 percentage points to 10.8% compared with a year earlier, with the biggest gain in the Hybrid IT segment, which includes the company’s servers and storage hardware products.
HPE shares gained about 4% in extended trading after closing at $12.93 in New York. The stock has declined 2.2% this year.
Hardware makers have seen weaker corporate demand for their products, with NetApp Inc.’s disappointing results causing concern for the industry. Analysts expected hardware sales could be hindered by weakening global economies and uncertainty because of the U.S.-China trade war.
HPE’s revenue declined 7% to $7.22 billion in the fiscal third quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $7.28 billion. Revenue fell in most HPE segments in the period ended July 31, with server sales dropping 12% and storage hardware decreasing 5% compared with a year earlier.
“It’s more competitive out there,” Neri said. “The market feels slower than before and we need to navigate through it.”
HPE’s revenue has contracted on a year-over-year basis in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Neri has been trying to reverse that trend by modernizing the company’s products and services with the moves to subscriptions and edge computing, which lets clients process information closer to their source rather than at far-away data centers. Analysts estimate the effort may begin to pay off by the second half of 2020."

He’s also on the boards of HPE and health insurer Anthem Inc.
Since 2015, when HP split into HPE (networking and consulting) and HP Inc. (PCs and printers), Neri has helped define the enterprise business’s scope, leading key acquisitions and the development of advanced servers while shuttering underperforming product lines.
The cloud has to move closer and closer to where the data is being generated. It’s cheaper to move the cloud to where the data is, not the data where the cloud is, so we promised last year, at HPE Discover in Las Vegas, to invest $4 billion to develop that set of road maps and technologies.
There’s no doubt that many of the workloads have moved to the public cloud. But big customers realize it’s cheaper for them to run things on their premises in their data center or in a sort of hybrid model. We believe that’s going to be the world as we go along, and there is a ton of opportunity to modernize that infrastructure and help customers decide what is the right mix.
Well, listen, we’re competing with everybody, you know? We compete on one spectrum with the public cloud vendors, on the other spectrum with the equipment vendors. But we have a clear understanding and strategy. And if you look at our latest results, we’re making significant progress.
The situation we’re in creates uncertainty, and when there is uncertainty, customers tend to step back a little bit. Obviously, there needs to be a fair approach to trade, but we live in a global economy, and the supply chains we’ve put in place over the last few decades are complicated.
More and more intelligence comes through the security analytics that make infrastructure more autonomous. Valuations tend to be a little bit erratic of late, but if it makes sense, we’ll consider it.
No, not at all. We’re focused on executing our strategy and making this company relevant for the future, to become a trusted adviser to our customers. And I have to say, we’re having a ton of fun.
First, you have to have a clear vision for yourself, where you want to be, and establish clear milestones. Second, you have to deliver what you say. Build a network of people who will take an interest in you. And then, taking risk is important. Sometimes you have to move sideways to move upward. • Listen to Bloomberg Businessweek With Carol Massar and Jason Kelly, weekdays at 2 p.m. – 5 p.m. ET on Bloomberg Radio

Washington’s campaign to contain the ascendancy of a potential global rival has expanded beyond telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. to a quintet of Chinese enterprises that embody a nation’s effort to build ever-faster computers. Those ultra-powerful machines, which process calculations on an unimaginable scale, support critical fields from massive data-crunching to artificial intelligence.
On Friday, five Chinese entities joined Huawei on a blacklist that bars them from buying American technology, just days ahead of an important summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Washington raised national security concerns because their computers were developed for military uses or in cooperation with the Chinese military. At the same time, U.S. pressure could have the effect of crimping China’s high-performance computing effort, which has produced some of the world’s fastest machines.
“China’s HPC business development will slow down for sure for both technology and business. However, there are other vendors that will narrow the gap as long as they are not put onto the list,” said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst with Forrester Research.
Among the five was government-backed Sugon, which claims to be the country’s leader in supercomputer sales. It’s one of a coterie of increasingly aggressive supercomputer projects backed by Beijing that are winning credibility in a field pioneered by American names that have fallen on hard times. The storied but money-losing Cray Inc., for example, agreed this year to be acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.
“There’s a broader concern about what China is going to do with supercomputers, particularly when it comes to military applications,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at the Eurasia Group.
Another addition to Washington’s blacklist is Higon, which Commerce identified as a Sugon subsidiary and partners with the U.S. chip maker Advanced Micro Device Inc. in a Chinese joint venture. AMD uses that venture -- Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. -- to license microprocessor technology to clients such as Higon in the world’s biggest PC market. Lisa Su, AMD’s chief executive officer, told a recent conference in Taiwan that AMD would not license newer technologies to Chinese clients. The company said Friday it will comply with the order.
Higon in turn part-owns another two on Trump’s list: Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology. The fifth entity is the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, which Commerce said was owned by the People’s Liberation Army’s 56th Research Institute. That agency’s mission was “to support China’s military modernization,” according to Commerce.
Sugon itself is open about working with the Chinese government and hopes to “build a cloud data service network covering hundreds of cities and sectors to provide a wealth of intelligent applications and services for the government, industry and the general population,” according to its website. The U.S. however accused the company on Friday of being “involved in activities determined to be contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.”
“Sugon is pretty small, but it’s symbolic,” said Triolo. “You can argue there’s a clearer national security case with Sugon than with Huawei.”
Taking Sugon out of the equation will hamper but not kill Beijing’s supercomputing endeavors. While the company and its units claim to be the volume leader, there are other outfits considered more advanced technically. They include Inspur Ltd., a computer and cloud services provider with government ties, and a plethora of projects backed by prestigious institutions. Those include an advanced earth ecosystem simulator inside Tsinghua University capable of processing 100 tera-floating-point operations a second.
If “chipset makers in the U.S. stop the supply of product that Sugon has been largely relying on for its high performance computing business, the impact on Sugon’s HPC business will be fatal,” Dai said.

Profit, excluding some items, will be $1.62 a share to $1.72 a share in fiscal 2019, an increase of 6 cents per share from the company’s guidance announced in February. Analysts, on average, projected $1.64.
Shares, which had jumped almost 5% in extended trading on the forecast, gave back all of the gains when executives said on a conference call that the trade war between the U.S. and China had caused uncertainty for the company. The stock closed at $14.34 in New York and has climbed 8.6% this year.
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri is trying to make the company a key hardware vendor for big-data needs, seeking to take advantage of technology trends from artificial intelligence to the internet of things. HPE said last week it would acquire Cray Inc., which makes high-performance computers used to process vast amounts of information, in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. What may prove more consequential is the U.S.-China trade war, which threatens to curb HPE’s revenue and raise some component costs.
Sales fell 4.3% from a year earlier to $7.15 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended April 30, the San Jose, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts projected $7.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted profit was 42 cents a share compared with analysts’ average estimate of 36 cents.
HPE’s sales have contracted on a year-over-year basis every quarter but one since 2017, and Neri has been keen to reverse that trend -- betting $4 billion on edge computing, which lets clients process information on hardware far away from centralized data centers.
The company’s “performance reflects our continued progress on shifting our portfolio to higher-margin products and services, to deliver positive and consistent earnings growth,” Neri said on a conference call with analysts.
The U.S.-China trade war is creating “uncertainty” for the hardware maker, which reported declining revenue from China in the quarter, executives said during the call. HPE generates revenue and profit from a joint venture in China that sells its products, H3C Technologies. Tsinghua Holdings owns 51% of the company. The joint venture underperformed expectations in the quarter, HPE executives said. The company is selling fewer products to H3C, which is offering more China-developed hardware for “profitable growth.”
While HPE has an option to sell its stake in H3C in the next three years, Neri said the company plans to hold on to the investment because it’s strategic and a valuable source of revenue.
“We’re very satisfied with our presence there,” Neri said in an interview. He doesn’t see the Trump administration’s crackdown on companies doing business with China affecting the joint venture because HPE is not sharing intellectual property with H3C, he said.
HPE may have to pay more for some assembly costs as well as minor components that come from China, such as batteries and electronics, said Anand Srinivasan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. HPE builds products for the Asia-Pacific region in China, but also manufactures in the U.S., Mexico and Europe.
The hardware company has had “execution issues” in North America while selling its Aruba networking devices, which include Wi-Fi routers and switches. Aruba product revenue fell 8% in the quarter compared with a year earlier. Neri said the company was reorganizing the way it sold to different tiers of clients, which has delayed some purchases.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. has agreed to buy U.S. supercomputer maker Cray Inc. in a deal valued at about $1.4 billion as the firm works to become more competitive in high-end computing.
Cray investors will get $35 a share in cash, the companies said in a statement on Friday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg report. That represents a premium of about 17% above Thursday’s closing price. The deal values Cray at $1.3 billion net of cash, the firms said in the statement.
Cray jumped 17% to $34.89 at 9:49 a.m. in New York trading after earlier touching $34.96, the biggest intraday gain in a year. Palo Alto-based HP Enterprise gained about 2% to $14.82.
The deal will help HP Enterprise strengthen its position against International Business Machines Corp. It could also become HP Enterprise’s biggest since it started trading in 2015, surpassing its acquisition of Nimble Storage Inc. for about $1 billion more than two years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
HP Enterprise has mostly been paring down since it was created from the breakup of Hewlett-Packard Co. In 2017, it completed a spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corp. It’s also separated some software assets in an $8.8 billion deal with U.K.-based Micro Focus International Plc.
Still, the company has also committed $4 billion through 2022 to initiatives to develop artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and distributed computing offerings. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri, who succeeded Meg Whitman last year, said in November that HP Enterprise would start to see a return on that investment over the next two years.
Loss-making Cray traces its roots back to a company founded in 1972 by Seymour Cray, known as the “father of supercomputing.” This month, it signed a deal with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build a new $600 million system for research on artificial intelligence, weather, subatomic structures, genomics and physics.
HP Enterprise’s own high-end computer systems are used by the University of Notre Dame, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and chemical giant BASF SE, according to its website. Last year, it won a $57 million contract to provide supercomputers to the U.S. Department of Defense for helicopter design and weather forecasting.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is heading straight to the campaign trail Thursday following a morning television appearance where he’s expected to announce that he’s making a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
He is scheduled to appear on ABC’s “Good Morning America” program and then fly to Iowa, where caucuses next February will formally kick off the nomination contest. He’s following that with a trip Saturday to South Carolina, another crucial early voting state.
NBC News reported on Wednesday that de Blasio would declare his bid on Thursday, citing an unnamed campaign spokesperson. Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for de Blasio, declined to comment.
A Facebook post by the Democratic organization in Iowa’s Woodbury County offered a welcome to the new candidate: “Come meet NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray.”
De Blasio, who was first elected mayor in 2013 after serving as the city’s public advocate, becomes the 23rd active candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. His campaign will underscore his advocacy of major investments in education and health care, warnings about income inequality. His high profile as the leader of the largest U.S. city could make his candidacy stand out in a very crowded field of people competing to challenge President Donald Trump in November 2020.
Earlier: De Blasio Targets Trump Buildings in Touting NYC Green New Deal
The race has been re-shaped by the presence of former Vice President Joe Biden, who has emerged as the front-runner since he announced his candidacy on April 25. Yet still more Democratic politicians have entered the contest since then, most recently Montana Governor Steve Bullock earlier this week.
De Blasio’s decision to run reverses a vow made in 2017 during a televised debate as he campaigned for a second term, when he looked straight at the camera and declared: “I will serve for four full years.” He began backtracking from that promise in January, when he told reporters, “the world has changed in the last couple of years.”
The message de Blasio’s presidential campaign intends to sell is a vision of New York as a successful city, with high employment, improved high school graduation rates and low crime.
His six years running City Hall have been a mixture of success and failure.
Both were on display earlier this year when Amazon.com Inc. chose Long Island City in Queens for a second headquarters -- then abruptly withdrew amid a fierce local backlash, chiefly over subsidies that had been offered to the company. The mayor and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a political rival, came under harsh criticism for conducting negotiations in secret, and then failing to salvage the deal.

The de Blasio administration created a universal pre-kindergarten program that now serves 70,000 students, and has embarked on a pre-school plan for 3-year-olds. A two-decade trend of decreasing crime has brought reports of murder and shootings to levels not seen since the 1960s.
And de Blasio and Cuomo earlier this year joined forces to win passage in the state Legislature of a congestion pricing plan that would charge motorists to drive in parts of Manhattan at peak times, and use the revenue to promote mass transit.

Analysts in recent weeks had been pointing to a lack of participation among many individual investors in the January rally, and so that dip, and the payrolls overhang removal (maybe even a clearing event?) may have been that excuse to jump in.
Morgan Stanley strategists did caution early Monday that the ""correction"" was likely not over. They wrote one shouldn’t trust the “strong"" rally off ""bad"" fourth quarter results, and that the correction won’t end until pressures on margin stabilize. Mike Wilson has been cautious for a while, and has one of the lowest S&P targets for year-end 2019, so the call for defensives to ""resume leadership"" shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. That being said, the analysts are only referring to the S&P 500 now as just ""modestly"" overvalued. They get ""more interested"" below 2600.
The post earnings season exhaustion is likely setting in, and with the exception of Broadcom, Adobe and Oracle later this week, stock-specific plays become fewer and further between. But today’s action brings opportunities in four names widely followed by the Street (three of them hedge fund hotels): Wells Fargo, in which Warren Buffett holds a sizable stake (>$21 billion as of WFC’s last close) goes before the House of Representatives, while earnings from three relatively recent IPOs (with wildly different performances since their offerings), Stitch Fix, Coupa Software and Switch Inc. are digested.
Wells Fargo shares may come under some additional pressure (no surprise it was the 3rd worst performer in the BKX Monday), with only CMA and NYCB performing worse (they faced their own demons in the form of a weaker than expected slides presentation and a downgrade, respectively) as the megabank will be the subject of hours-long scrutiny from Congressional members of the House of Representatives that will surely look upon the megabank will less favor than the prior Republican-held Congress. The title of the hearing should tell you all you need to know: “Holding Megabanks Accountable: An Examination of Wells Fargo’s Pattern of Consumer Abuses.” More about WFC’s and the upcoming hearing can be found here.
Coupa Software (with 18% of its shares held by hedge fund managers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg) reported post market, and, despite the expected volatility that had been priced in, is looking flat in the pre-market. Analysts from Morgan Stanley noted a beat on billings and margins and that the company deserves its premium, but ultimately the risk/reward is ""balanced.”. The software developer serving the public and private sector will also host an analyst day later today. Needham analysts heading into the print wrote that expectations were ""high"" given its “premium valuation,” and would be buyers on any weakness. Forecasts were a little light for 2020 earnings, but Coupa for the most part exceeded expectations.
To add to confusion today, Stitch Fix (24% held by hedge funds including Bill Miller’s Miller Value and Jackson Square Partners; its also a favorite short seller target), reported post market (not to be confused with and ahead of fellow hedge fund hotel Switch Inc., which reports later today), and blew out expectations for revenue, Ebitda, net revenue forecasts. Piper Jaffray analysts ""remain on the sidelines"" despite the better than expected results, citing the company’s ""muted"" plans to compete in U.K. while the valuation assumes ""above industry terminal EBIT margin."" The high short interest may be responsible for the share movement in the pre-market, with a possible mini squeeze with shares up more than 25%.
And Switch, due later today and boasting 35% of its outstanding shares held by the hedge fund community is in for a ride, with options pricing in an implied move of nearly 14%. BMO analysts earlier in the week wrote that they had been ""disappointed by the lack of revenue visibility"" in the name, but noted the company’s ramping eBay business could offset some of its other sales delays.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise was cut to sell at UBS, which also slashed its price target to a Street-low of $13 as it expects the company’s on-premises hardware sales to face a rising headwind from cloud-computing growth. Increased cloud adoption “will likely grow into a bigger headwind as it moves up from a 20% share,” analyst John Roy wrote. The 15% average selling price growth HPE’s serves saw “is unlikely to repeat,” and “we do not see a 2H19 recovery.” UBS is expecting a revenue decline of 2% in 2019, compared with growth of 7% last year. Shares are down about 2.5% pre-market.
HSBC expects Cola-Cola to go flat, downgrading the stock to hold and dropping its target by $14 to $50. The firm sees “both new and unresolved old problems” as the company transitions to a total beverage model, and is skeptical of how well it can execute the move. “Coke is trying to grow the pie, requiring it to drive revenues but with low-margin brands that may take years to scale up,” analyst Carlos Laboy wrote, adding that KO “can afford to do it only if bottlers go along.” However, “convincing bottlers to believe is getting harder” as the brands with the fastest growth aren’t profitable enough, and “the brands that pay the bills hardly grow.” In addition, HSBC sees new competition from brewers, who are “increasingly integrating beer and soft drinks to compete better,” along with rising sugar taxes and regulation.
Also in the beverage space, BMO Capital Markets cut its view on Monster Beverage to market perform from outperform, seeing “limited upside” to the company’s, ahem, “monster premium.” The current valuation “may be as good as it gets given cloudier growth outlook and dwindling likelihood” of a long-hoped-for buyout by Coca-Cola. Analyst Amit Sharma also sees “modest, if any” gross margin expansion in the U.S due to inflation, a greater contribution from lower-margin products, and the risk that the company may have to promote more in order to protect its volume share. Meanwhile, Red Bull is expanding its price cuts while the energy drink Bang is capturing a lot of the category’s growth, “with MNST being the biggest share donor.”

Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg’s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.
The  victory of the Socialists in Portugal contrasts sharply with the ebbing of center-left parties elsewhere in Europe, be it at the hand of the Greens or the far-right. The challenge for Antonio Costa in his second term will be to deliver the social gains that he promised while maintaining ambitious budget targets amid a slowing economy. Critics say Costa didn’t use the good times to carry out long-needed reforms and prepare the indebted Iberian nation for the next downturn. Growth is already at half the pace it was two years ago. 
Still Talking | U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson  remains defiant about Britain leaving the EU on Oct. 31, but only has  until the end of this week to convince Europe’s leaders he has a realistic proposal in time for their next summit. Wonder where we’re headed? Robert Hutton answers your questions here.
Retirement Blues | Pension funds across Europe are  struggling to generate the returns they need to cover their growing obligations. The industry is now urging the  EU Commission to change the rules, especially since a complex mathematical formula constructed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority is not working as intended. 
Migration Debate | Home affairs ministers will debate the state of play on migration tomorrow as a recent spike in arrivals to Greece is pushing the issue  back to the top of the EU’s agenda. Emma Vickers and Caroline Alexander explain why migration is expected to swell in the years ahead, but also how it benefits economies and can actually  reduce crime rates. 
German Sluggishness | German factory orders and industrial production readings this week will give vital clues on the health of Europe’s biggest economy. The output data for August will provide the pivotal indication on whether gross domestic product declined for the second successive quarter, the official definition of a recession.
Tariff Reaction | Cheeses from France, Italy and the Netherlands, wines, Scotch whisky and Greek canned peaches are just some of the European exports whose prices are set to rise in the U.S. after the Trump administration announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of EU products starting next week.  Here’s how the continent’s producers plan to react. 
Aircraft Probe | Boeing’s ventures with Embraer face a deeper antitrust probe from the EU, as regulators said the transaction threatens to knock out an important rival to the world’s biggest planemakers. The  European Commission is worried the deal would “remove Embraer as the third largest global competitor” to both Boeing and Airbus, which “may therefore result in higher prices and less choice.”
Spanish Polls | Spain’s Socialists would once more be the most voted party in an electoral rerun but would still fall short of a majority, according to an IMOP Insights poll published by El Confidencial. The country is heading to its fourth election in as many years next month, and the survey suggests it may end up in the same stalemate. 
Maltese Mystery | And now to  some spying news. Read  how the strange case of a missing Maltese professor and former campus adviser is now one of multiple threads entangled in the dispute over Donald Trump’s efforts to show he was the victim of foreign meddling in the 2016 election and not the beneficiary of interference by Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
Bulgarian Star | Hot on the heels of Ukraine’s comic-turned-president, another showman wants to take on the political establishment — this time in nearby Bulgaria, the EU’s poorest member-state. Satirical TV host Stanislav Trifonov vows to fight against the “thick line dividing the party aristocracy and the Bulgarian people,” Slav Okov reports from Sofia. 
Breakaway Vote | Kosovo’s opposition parties won an early general election,  signaling a turn away from politicians who rose to prominence as guerrilla fighters against Serbia in the 1990s. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his country was ready to resume talks to normalize relations with whomever forms a new government in Kosovo if  punitive trade tariffs are lifted.
Turkey has been reinforcing army units at the Syrian border, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signaled an  imminent cross-border operation against U.S.-backed Kurdish militants in Syria. The White House said U.S. forces  won’t stand in the way.

Joe Biden declined to say Friday whether he’d vote to convict and remove President Donald Trump from office if he were still in the Senate.
“I am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,” he told reporters in Los Angeles. “I’m a former vice president, I know what occurred in Ukraine, I know what occurred in terms of China, I know what occurred in terms of Russia. This is a president trying to get two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, to decide who he runs against.”
He added: “This guy, like all bullies, is a coward. He does not want to run against me.”
House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry against Trump to determine whether he acted improperly by asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for releasing aid. The president has also called on China to investigate the Bidens for “corruption.” There is no evidence either Biden or his son committed any wrongdoing.
A vote to impeach in the House would have to be followed by a trial in the Senate.
Elizabeth Warren’s campaign fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after investigating allegations of “inappropriate behavior.”
Campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement that over the past two weeks senior leaders of the campaign “received multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior” by McDaniel. The campaign hired outside counsel to conduct an investigation, she added.
“Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,” Orthman said.
The campaign did not specify the nature of the complaints. -- Emma Kinery and Sahil Kapur
Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock raised $2.3 million in the past three months, the smallest third-quarter take disclosed so far by a campaign.
The campaign said he doubled the number of individual contributions and his average online donation was $24. It did not say how many unique contributors he had.
Bullock, the governor of Montana, who has made getting big money out of politics a major theme of his campaign, raised far less than the fundraising leader, Bernie Sanders, who brought in $25.3 million, or author and political novice Marianne Williamson, who took in $3.1 million.
The Bullock campaign said it would apply to the Federal Election Commission for taxpayer-financed matching funds, which would add up to $250 for each contributor’s aggregate donation. In exchange, the campaign will be limited to how much it can spend in the primaries -- set at $48 million in 2016. That application will require approval from the FEC, which doesn’t have a quorum of four commissioners to make decisions.
Bullock currently polls at less than 1% in the RealClearPolitics average. He didn’t qualify for the Democratic debate in September or for the next one, in Ohio on Oct.15. -- Bill Allison
Joe Biden said his son Hunter would join him on the campaign trail, despite attacks from Donald Trump over his business dealings in Ukraine, but equivocated on where or when.
In an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal on Thursday, Biden was asked whether Hunter would campaign with him.
“Yes,” he answered. But when pressed, Biden said that Hunter Biden lives in the West, and that they hadn’t worked out any specifics.
Trump has accused Biden and his son of “corruption” over Hunter’s involvement with a Ukrainian energy company. House Democrats have begun an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Trump acted improperly by asking the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens in exchange for U.S. weapons. There is no evidence either Biden or his son committed any wrongdoing.
Hunter Biden has not made any appearances with his father during the campaign to date. When asked why Hunter would be an asset, he replied: “Because he’s my son,” he said. “He’s a fine young man.” -- Max Berley
Elizabeth Warren reintroduced her Accountable Capitalism Act on Friday, a measure that would require companies to allow employees to select at least 40% of a corporation’s board of directors.
The legislation, introduced with Representative Ben Ray Lujan, Democrat of New Mexico, stands no chance of progress while Republicans control the White House and Senate, and her earlier effort didn’t succeed. It would change the way large corporations operate, in keeping with Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign pitch to regulate business and tackle inequality.
Warren accompanied the announcement with letters to the CEOs of multiple companies -- including Amazon.com Inc., General Motors Co., Walmart Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP PLC, AT&T Inc., Comcast Corp., Cigna Corp., and Union Pacific Corp. -- asking what they intend to do to serve their workers. -- Sahil Kapur
Marianne Williamson raised $3.1 million for her long-shot presidential campaign, roughly doubling the amount she collected in the previous period.
She ended the quarter with $655,276 cash on hand, and has 140,000 unique contributors since starting her campaign, according to a statement released by her campaign manager, Patricia Ewing.
“It’s the American people who decide which candidates have a voice that needs to be heard, not the gatekeepers,” Ewing said.
Williamson failed to meet the fundraising and polling requirements to participate in the debate of Democratic candidates last month and didn’t qualify for the next forum on Oct. 15 in Ohio.
Williamson, who’s polling at less than 1% in the RealClearPolitics average, lags far behind top fundraisers like Bernie Sanders, who brought in $25.3 million, and Pete Buttigieg, who raised $19.1 million. Candidates must officially report third-quarter totals to the Federal Election Commission on Oct. 15. -- Bill Allison
Democratic candidates will attend a presidential forum hosted by the 2 million member Service Employees International Union in Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday. So far, Cory Booker, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Julian Castro are set to attend.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union will host forums in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidates on Oct. 13. Biden, Booker, Harris, and Buttigieg and Michael Bennet have confirmed they will be there.

Subscribe via Pocket Cast or  iTunes.
Helena Morrissey left Legal & General Investment Management amid reports that she was interviewed to take over from Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England.
Morrissey stepped down after close to three years as head of personal investing at the London-based asset manager, according to a company statement on Friday. The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported last month that Morrissey, a prominent Brexit backer, had been sounded out for the BOE’s top job. Carney is due to step down at the end of January.
“I see a changing Britain and have a lot of ideas and other things that I want to achieve,” Morrissey said in the statement. “I am looking forward to the next phase of my career at a time of great change and opportunity.”
The BOE succession is clouded in uncertainty as Brexit consumes the government’s time. The appointment was originally scheduled to be made this autumn, but the Treasury has pushed back the timeline as the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union approaches.
“The process is on track and we will make an appointment in due course,” the Treasury said.
A spokeswoman for Morrissey said she couldn’t comment on the speculation.
Before joining LGIM in 2017, Morrissey was chief executive officer of Newton Investment Management for 15 years. Hers is the second major departure from the asset manager this year, following ex-CEO Mark Zinkula’s exit.
In her role, Morrissey helped launch the Future World GIRL Fund, which favors companies that have achieved higher levels of gender diversity. She will be replaced in the personal-investing role by Honor Solomon, currently head of retail for EMEA, and Emma Douglas, head of defined contribution.

Bidding for the 14-foot-wide painting, titled “Devolved Parliament,” lasted 13 minutes before the hammer fell at Sotheby’s evening auction of contemporary art. The work, acquired by Sotheby’s Emma Baker for an anonymous client, had a presale estimate of 1.5 million to 2 million pounds.
The sale smashed Banksy’s previous auction record of 1.04 million pounds set last year when another of his paintings, “Girl With Balloon,” famously self-destructed. A shredding device installed within the piece was remotely activated after the final bid had been accepted.

Thursday’s auction saw no such shenanigans -- at least not yet.
Sotheby’s sold more than three dozen works for a total of 54.4 million pounds, including Jean-Michel Basquiat’s “Pyro,"" which matched the Banksy price of 9.88 million pounds, including fees. A Nicole Eisenman canvas, “Close to the Edge,” fetched 639,000 pounds, a record for the American artist.

Source: Bloomberg
Joe Biden’s campaign said he raised had $15.2 million during the third quarter, putting him behind lower-polling candidates Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.
The announcement came less than an hour after Biden himself disclosed the fundraising total at a private fundraiser in Palo Alto, California.

The Biden campaign said that its average donation was $44 and that 56% of those contributing in the third quarter gave for the first time. The last week of the quarter was Biden’s best for online fundraising since early May when the campaign solicited donations around his kickoff rally in Philadelphia.
“The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond,” said campaign manager Greg Schultz. “Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.”
Biden’s haul puts him behind both Sanders and Buttigieg, who raised $25.3 million and $19.1 million in the last quarter. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million and Elizabeth Warren has yet to announce her third quarter fundraising numbers.
The former vice president spent much of the last week holding private fundraisers, including five last week in Southern California. The reporting period runs from July through September, so the total doesn’t include some of Biden’s fundraising after news broke that President Donald Trump had pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.
President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that he’s preparing for a possible face-off against Elizabeth Warren as the Democratic nominee in the 2020 presidential election.
Calling her “Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren,” Trump reprised a favorite slur for the Massachusetts senator who’s surging in polls of candidates for the Democratic nomination. Trump said he thought his use of the nickname had ruined Warren’s prospects in the Democratic primary, but now sees her as a potential victor over long-time front-runner Joe Biden.
Trump said he likely would aim new attacks at Warren in anticipation of a head-to-head matchup. “Now we’re probably going to have to do it again because I don’t see Sleepy Joe making it,” he said during a speech at The Villages, a retirement community in Florida. “I thought she was gone.”
Most of Trump’s speech was devoted to health care. He promised his elderly audience that Medicare “will never be taken away from you,” and criticized Democratic plans to expand health insurance coverage either by putting all Americans in Medicare or by creating a government-run “public option” plan.
“All the Democrat plans would devastate our health care system,” he said. “The last administration was frankly moderate compared to the maniacs you’re hearing from today. These are maniacs.” -- Alex Wayne
Any of the three leading Democratic candidates for president would beat Vice President Mike Pence in Ohio if he became the 2020 Republican nominee in the event Donald Trump is impeached, according to an Emerson University poll released Thursday.
Joe Biden would beat the vice president, 54% to 46%, and Pence would lose to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both at 51% to 49%.
The Democrats would also defeat Trump. Biden and Sanders both lead in a potential head-to-head match-up, 53% to 47%. Warren is ahead, 52% to 48%.
The Ohio survey is the first Emerson poll on Pence’s prospects at the top of the ticket if Trump is removed from office. The poll used land-line telephones and online surveys, and has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.
Barack Obama carried Ohio in 2008 and 2012. But Trump flipped the state in 2016. Ohio has voted for the winner of the presidential election in every contest since 1964. -- Gregory Korte
Joe Biden is unveiling a $6 million advertising blitz on broadcast and digital platforms in four early nominating states, his campaign announced.
So far, Biden has spent an estimated $600,000, all in the Iowa market. The new campaign, which will also run in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, aims to synchronize Biden’s messaging across broadcast television, social media and other digital channels, including streaming services. The Democrat’s campaign said the ads won’t just be targeted to voters, but were also intended to mobilize his supporters and build his grassroots fundraising base.
“We know that Vice President Biden’s campaign pillars like protecting and building on Obamacare and restoring the soul of the nation are resonating in communities across America,” campaign manager Greg Schultz said. The campaign said earlier ads, highlighting Biden’s themes of fighting for the soul of the nation and protecting access to health care, had been successful, but didn’t say whether it would continue to run those spots or develop new ones for its most recent buy.
Biden has been the front-runner in national polls, but Elizabeth Warren has surged into a virtual tie with him in several recent surveys. Warren has booked $6.6 million worth of air time in early states starting in January 2020, according to data from Advertising Analytics, which tracks spending on political commercials. -- Bill Allison
The White House had thought about taking a swipe at Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All plan -- and then thought again.
The administration recast the title for the health-care executive order President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign Thursday to “Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation’s Seniors” from “Protecting Medicare from Socialist Destruction.”
Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and Trump has tried to brand all his Democratic opponents as socialist radicals. Sanders’ signature plan would eliminate private insurance in favor of a government-run program that offers Medicare, which provides health-care coverage those over 65, to younger Americans.
Trump is to travel to Florida Thursday where he’ll speak about health policy. His remarks will focus on Medicare Advantage, a program in which private insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc. provide benefits in place of the government, administration officials said.
“I don’t know that we did change the name to be honest with you,” Joe Grogan, head of the White House domestic policy council, told reporters Thursday. “We’re protecting the program for our nation’s seniors and protecting it from a socialist vision of the program.” -- Jennifer Jacobs
Snubbing her California colleague in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein is co-hosting a fundraiser for Joe Biden on Thursday in San Francisco.
Feinstein had said she would support Biden even before he entered the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, choosing him over California Senator Kamala Harris, who has been endorsed by many California politicians.
Dianne Feinstein
“My candidate would be Joe Biden,” Feinstein told reporters in January. “I watched him as vice president. I’ve seen him operate. I’ve seen him perform and I think he brings a level of experience and seniority, which I think is really important.”
Co-hosting the event are Feinstein’s husband, Richard Blum, and Denise Bauer, who was ambassador to Belgium in the Obama administration. Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992.
Biden will attend multiple fundraisers in the Bay Area on Thursday before heading to Los Angeles to participate in a labor forum on Friday. -- Tyler Pager
Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker on Thursday unveiled a plan that he says would cut childhood poverty by two-thirds through a proposed child tax credit and by bolstering existing welfare programs.
The tax credit would give a $300-a-month “child allowance” to families with “younger kids,” and $250 to families with children up to the age of 18. The credit would be indexed to inflation. Booker, New Jersey’s junior senator and a former mayor of Newark, also proposes to increase the maximum Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit by 30% and reform the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to inflation-adjusted levels -- a 40% increase in funding.
Booker, who is currently polling at 1.4% nationally, has made addressing poverty and preparing children for success a key point of his campaign through ideas like Baby Bonds, which would give every newborn a $1,000 bond that would be placed in a low-risk account managed by the U.S. Treasury. Recipients could get the funds upon turning 18 and use them toward things like college or buying a home.
“In the richest country in the world, we have a moral responsibility to look after each other and make sure that every child living in America has the opportunity to grow and thrive,” Booker said in a statement.
An analysis of the plan by Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy cited by the campaign estimated that it would decrease the childhood poverty rate from 14.8% to 5% -- raising 7.3 million children out of poverty -- and would cost $65 billion a year. -- Emma Kinery
Democratic candidates will attend a presidential forum hosted by the 2 million member Service Employees International Union in Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday. So far, Booker, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Julian Castro are set to attend.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union will host forums in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidates on Oct. 13. Biden, Booker, Harris, and Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bennet have confirmed they will be there.

President Donald Trump is signaling he’ll fight tooth and nail against Democrats’ impeachment efforts, by disparaging a whistle-blower complaint stemming from his controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and telling donors behind closed doors, “We’re at war.”
Defiance was the watchword of the week in the U.K. and Hong Kong as well. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded to a Supreme Court rebuke by doubling down on his plans for a no-deal Brexit, while protesters in the Asian financial hub adopted ever-more militaristic tactics. Dig deeper into these and other topics you might have overlooked this week  and click here for Bloomberg’s most compelling political photos from the past seven days.  
  Change in the Saudi Birthplace of Islam Is Eyed Warily WorldwideAs the birthplace of Islam, Saudi Arabia is the country that the world’s 1.8 million Muslims look to above all others. But, as Anisah Shukry, Arys Aditya and Archana Chaudhary​​​​​​​ write, the latest in a series of liberalizing reforms attributed to the modernizing influence of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman runs counter to its reputation for religious conservatism.

Zamira Hajiyeva, who was unmasked last year as part of a British crackdown on foreigners linked to overseas corruption, won’t be sent to her home country, Judge Emma Arbuthnot said Thursday at Westminster Magistrates Court. Arbuthnot said that while Hajiyeva gave no explanation for where her money came from, she was worried about the Azerbaijan legal system’s ability to deal with a case that raised political issues.
Hajiyeva, who had no income of her own, attracted attention from British authorities after splashing 16 million pounds ($19.8 million) in funds across Europe, including at London’s Harrods department store. Her husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, the former head of International Bank of Azerbaijan, is serving a 16-year prison sentence in the country for abuse of his office. Even though his annual earnings as a state employee never went beyond $70,000, his wife owned a pair of properties in the upmarket Knightsbridge area in London.
“The combination of a judiciary which is not independent of the executive, lawyers who are punished if they take on cases of interest to the state, the approach of the court and authorities to Mr. Hajiyev’s trial, all lead me to conclude that there is a real risk that Mrs. Hajiyeva, whose case is high-profile and sensitive and not a normal criminal case will suffer a flagrant denial of justice,” the judge said.
The government plans to appeal.
A lawyer for Hajiyeva declined to comment, citing ongoing proceedings. She’s set to fight the anti-corruption order in the Court of Appeal later in the year.
Hajiyeva, who was arrested last year, won’t get a fair trial in Azerbaijan, her attorney Hugo Keith said at hearings earlier in the year. The former Soviet republic under President Ilham Aliyev has seen the legal profession “terrorized,” he said.
Still, the judge said there appeared to be a strong case against Hajiyeva regarding a conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime. “There has been no explanation for the money that she spent,” she said.

Thomas Cook Group Plc filed for compulsory liquidation in the early hours of Monday after last-ditch rescue talks failed. The company that invented the package holiday ceased to operate overnight, with all of its flights and bookings canceled.
Thomas Cook will now be handed over to administrators who will seek to sell what they can to pay off creditors who owed about 1.9 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).
AlixPartners, a global consultancy firm, will oversee the liquidation and KPMG will help manage some Thomas Cook subsidiaries. Shareholders will be completely wiped out, while creditors will recover a fraction of their original investment from proceeds of asset sales. This process can be spread across multiple distributions and take years.
In a report drafted before Thomas Cook filed for liquidation, AlixPartners said bondholders could get back between 2.2% and 6.3%. Lenders may get as much as 16.7% back on a revolving credit facility.
Unlikely. A compulsory liquidation usually means the company ceases trading, according to Emma Shipp, partner at law firm Hewitsons. Rivals may snap up parts of the business, thereby ensuring their survival, but there’s little sign of any potential buyers.
“It may be that certain parts of the business will be bought out in which case the employment contracts of staff working in that area will be transferred with the business but that depends on buyers coming forward very quickly and there seems no indication of that,” she said.
Thomas Cook is the latest European travel company to file for administration or go through liquidation in the past decade. In the airline sector, Air Berlin Plc, Germany’s second-largest carrier, filed for administration in 2017. Iceland’s Wow Air closed down in November after a failed merger with Icelandair, and French airline Aigle Azur will cease business at the end of the month.
Other high profile cases involved Monarch Airlines in October 2017 and more recently, construction company Carillion, which collapsed in 2018.
Thomas Cook liquidation ends months of talks that had led to an agreed $1.1 billion rescue led by Fosun Tourism Group. The plan involved injecting new capital and swapping debt for shares in the company which would have handed majority control of the tourism arm to Fosun. Creditors would have taken over the airline unit. Negotiations collapsed after Thomas Cook was unable to find backers for an additional 200 million pound credit line requested last week by its largest banks. The U.K. government turned down a request for financial help but will have to foot the bill for bringing home more than 150,000 Thomas Cook customers stranded overseas.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the decision to refuse the bailout that he said had been requested, to the tune of 150 million pounds. ”That’s a lot of taxpayers’ money,” he told reporters. ”It sets a moral hazard.”
That repatriation is twice the size of that arranged for customers of Monarch Airlines, a carrier which went insolvent two years ago, which cost about 50 million pounds, the government said.
Thomas Cook’s collapse wipes out shareholders. Its shares were suspended after it entered into liquidation. Through to the close of trading on Friday, the shares had fallen 89% in 2019, the worst-performing stock in the FTSE All-Share in the year-to-date. The company’s euro bonds lost more than two-thirds of their value on Monday to trade and now they will be part of the claims creditor will try to recoup during liquidation.
For hedge funds and other investors who bought credit default swaps insuring exposure to the company’s debt against default, the situation is different. The liquidation is likely to trigger the payout on their holdings, which may amount to as much as $250 million.
