A 17-year-old Israeli girl was killed in a terrorist attack near the West Bank settlement of Dolev, Israeli officials said. Her father and brother were also injured in the blast.
The attack Friday morning comes amid heightened tensions between Palestinians and Israelis in the lead up to Israel’s national elections next month, and against the backdrop of a broader financial dispute between the two sides that has left the Palestinian Authority struggling to pay employees.
The Israel Defense Forces said three Israeli civilians were hurt in the blast from an improvised explosive device while they were at a spring near Dolev, about 19 kilometers (12 miles) north of Jerusalem. Emergency services said the girl had died and two men, aged 46 and 20, were described as being in a serious condition.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed condolences to the family, while reiterating his government’s commitment to the settlements -- a key part of his campaign strategy ahead of the national poll on Sept. 17.
Israeli troops are blocking routes and boosting their presence in the area as officers assess the situation. Netanyahu said security forces are in pursuit of the “abhorrent terrorists.”
Tensions have been exacerbated in Israel this year as the financial plight of Palestinians worsened. The Israeli government began withholding about $11 million a month, or roughly 5% of what it collects in tax on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. Israel said the money was being used to pay stipends to families of Palestinians shot dead by Israeli security forces -- some after they had killed Israeli citizens -- or to families of those held in Israeli prisons.
Palestinian officials, who describe the payments as welfare for families of jailed relatives, had refused to accept any funds unless they received the taxes in full. But on Thursday, the PA said it would make a special salary payment to government staff after reaching an agreement with Israel that meant it had more to spend.
Attacks against Israelis have intensified in recent weeks. The daily Haaretz newspaper reported this week that security agencies were increasingly concerned over an outbreak of violence before Israel’s election.

1,ADOM,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-25/gaza-strip-rocket-hits-home-wounds-family-in-central-israel,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-25/gaza-strip-rocket-hits-home-wounds-family-in-central-israel,"March 25, 2019, 1:29 AM EDT",Israel Launches Strikes Across Gaza After Day of Rocket Fire,"Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip on Monday evening, following a tense day that began with a rocket attack on a home in central Israel and a counterstrike that reduced the office of Hamas’s leader to ruins.
Amid the escalation, both sides made preparations for the possibility of a broader confrontation. Israel moved troops closer to its southern border and declared closed military zones near Gaza. Reserves were called up, additional Iron Dome missile-defense batteries were deployed and bomb shelters were opened, including in Tel Aviv.
Television reports showed near-empty streets in southern Israeli communities. In Gaza, hospitals across the territory were put on an emergency footing.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Washington for a speech and meetings with President Donald Trump, called the initial strike, which injured seven people in a village 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Gaza, a “criminal attack on the state of Israel” and vowed to “respond forcefully.” Netanyahu initially was expected to cut his visit to Washington short, though it wasn’t clear later if he would follow through on that.
The conflict overshadowed Trump’s decision on Monday to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, reversing decades of U.S. policy with a presidential proclamation. A major military escalation could prove risky for Netanyahu, who is facing a tough re-election battle on April 9 amid a wide-ranging corruption scandal.
“It highlights an area that he’s perceived as not having delivered the results,” said Israel Democracy Institute President Yohanan Plesner. “The political impact of this Gaza escalation is also that it draws the attention away from the Trump recognition of the Golan Heights that was supposed to be an important moment in his campaign.”
If he stays in Washington, Netanyahu will likely address the annual America Israel Public Affairs Committee conference on Tuesday, as he was originally scheduled to do.
Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, late Monday night reported that the two sides had reached a cease-fire agreement through Egyptian mediation, although airstrikes and rocket fire continued. Netanyahu’s office, the Foreign Ministry and the Israeli army all declined to comment on the cease-fire claim, as they customarily do.
A damaged house after it was hit by a rocket north of Tel Aviv on March 25.
Attacks on Israel have escalated since Hamas suppressed recent protests against living conditions in the coastal enclave, which is groaning under Israeli and Egyptian blockades, sanctions imposed by the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, and Hamas taxes.
Weekly protests along the border with Israel have morphed into confrontations between soldiers and Hamas-led “nighttime confusion units,” backed by teams dispatching incendiary balloons. Three Palestinians were killed in confrontations last weekend in what Palestinians call the “Marches of Return,” which are approaching their one-year anniversary this weekend.
None of the militant groups in Gaza claimed responsibility for Monday morning’s rocket attack, saying it had been an accident -- the same explanation given for a March 14 attack near Tel Aviv that caused no injuries or damage. The attacks challenge Netanyahu’s reputation as the guardian of Israel’s security just as he faces a challenge at the polls from a center-left bloc led by former Army chief Benny Gantz.
“I have a simple message to Israel’s enemies: We will do whatever we must do to defend our people and defend our state,” Netanyahu said at a news conference with Trump at the White House, saying he would “lead the people of Israel and the soldiers of Israel.”
Israel’s army said its targets included a secret Hamas intelligence headquarters that was one of the group’s “central assets,” as well as the office of Hamas Chairman Ismail Haniyeh, who vowed that “our people won’t surrender.” Gaza health officials reported seven people were injured in the wave of attacks.
The rocket fire interrupted a U.S. trip Netanyahu hoped would bolster an election campaign tarnished by his recent entanglement in a naval acquisition bribery scandal. The prime minister, who is likely to be indicted in three other corruption cases, has not been a suspect in the case, but Israeli media say prosecutors are weighing investigating him after learning Netanyahu once held shares in a company that supplied German shipbuilder Thyssenkrupp AG. Netanyahu says he sold the shares in 2010, long before the sub order, and is innocent of any wrongdoing.
Some polls have shown Netanyahu’s Likud party slipping since the reports emerged, but his current coalition of right-wing and religious parties still would have an advantage over Gantz’s bloc. Gantz, addressing AIPAC on Monday, staked out hardline security positions similar to Netanyahu’s, while calling for domestic unity.
“The reality in the south, as we unfortunately saw today, where Israeli children spend their nights in bomb shelters while the heads of Hamas celebrate, must end now,” Gantz said. He also swiped at Netanyahu, saying “divisive dialogue” is tearing Israel apart, and pledged that a government he leads would have no corruption.

A festival of concerts and fireworks for the kingdom’s national day has taken on greater importance.
Less than a week after an attack on its largest oil refinery exposed Saudi Arabia’s weakness, the country will erupt in celebration for a holiday to showcase its strength.
The kingdom’s 89th National Day, replete with five days of fireworks, has taken on new significance this year for Saudis. It already was supposed to be the biggest ever extravaganza after a year of international pressure on leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Then came last weekend’s drone strikes on one of the world’s biggest spenders on defense. 
For Saudis strolling along Riyadh’s Tahlia Street, the celebrations, planned months in advance, are an occasion to show defiance in the face of the most serious violation of Saudi sovereignty in decades.
“It’s important to celebrate our national day to reinforce our love for our country and to show the enemy we’re not scared and it won’t affect us,” said Amal al-Mutairi, a 24-year-old student who wore a pin with pictures of Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman, on her black abaya cloak.

Nearby, Saudis gathered to watch traditional dances performed to rhythmic music and children hoisted on their dad’s shoulders waved the kingdom’s flag. Patisseries sold cakes dyed in the flag’s green color and shops offered special discounts for the occasion.
Entertainment company Cirque du Soleil will perform in the Eastern Province at a location an hour’s drive from the site of the unprecedented Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabia’s energy industry. Concerts, street festivals and art and craft workshops will be held across the kingdom under the slogan “Himma Hatta al-Qimma,” which roughly means “Strength Until the End.”
The theme of the events for the Sept. 23 National Day was inspired by Prince Mohammed’s words last year in which he compared his people’s strength to the country’s Twaiq Mountain, said Amr Banaja, chief executive officer of the General Entertainment Authority, which is organizing the events.
“The aspirations of Saudis will never break just like this mountain won't,” Banaja said in an interview on Thursday before the festivities kicked off. “So nothing will stop us.”
Saudi Arabia has been stepping up a  public relations campaign both at home and abroad. Its reputation in the U.S. and other countries has been battered by the war in Yemen, the detention of female activists and the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October.
The U.S. Congress has condemned the Saudis over the Khashoggi murder and the Yemen military campaign.
Saudi and U.S. officials have said the drones and missiles used in the refinery strike last week were made by Iran, had never before been deployed by Iranian proxy groups and came from a northerly direction, ruling out Yemen as a launch site.
But they stopped short of saying the strikes were  launched directly from or by the Islamic Republic, claims that could have propelled a drift toward war. The attacks caused an unprecedented surge in oil prices.
“The impact of the attack against the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure will be felt long after the physical damage has been repaired and key infrastructure reconstructed,” Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at political risk company Verisk Maplecroft, said in a report. “Most importantly, the attacks have highlighted a vulnerability that cannot be easily or quickly remedied.”

In a sea of electric concepts and far-off prototypes, a shift in tone may indicate the supers have jumped the shark. 
Pininfarina promises its Battista supercar will come with 1,900 horsepower, zero emissions, and an all-electric range of 280 miles. 
At the Frankfurt Auto Show this month, Lamborghini will unveil a V12 hybrid supercar called the Siån.
The Bologna, Italy-based brand will make 63 of them, all already spoken for.
Lamborghini had hinted at its importance publicly in recent months and described in past detail how such special projects form an integral part of the business. Though unconfirmed, early reports set the price of the car around $3 million—an astronomical though increasingly common amount.  
“The  Reventon prompted the big discussion about the dimensions of this segment,” Maurizio Reggiani, Lamborgini’s chief engineer, told Bloomberg Pursuits during an interview in his office at company headquarters, noting that Lamborghini “started” the segment with its Lamborghini Reventon in 2007. “We were the first to do it like this. As we scouted more and more during that time, we started to see how, in this market, you can stretch in terms of price and in terms of demand. The Reventon coupe was $3 million; the [Reventon] roadster was $3.2 million; the Centenario was $2 million. So in this segment, we know there is a marvelous market.”
The mid-engine V12, all-wheel-drive Reventon famously hit 220mph on a test in Dubai, an astounding figure for a production car at that time. Only 20 were made, plus one marked for the Lamborghini museum. 
Should it happen, the new hybrid will join a burgeoning field of extremely limited-edition hybrid and electric supercars from such luxury powerhouses as Aston Martin, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Lotus, Mercedes-Benz, and Pininfarina. They have been flaunted recently in dazzling hues on golf courses and during private parties at seaside villas, heralded on Instagram fanboy accounts and Rodeo Drive parades orchestrated for YouTube.
Where it used to be that a company would have only one ever, or at most, one per year, now it seems they’re whipping them up as fast as possible. In the past year, Aston Martin alone has debuted and promised supercars in spades: the super-lightweight 1,160-horsepower Valkyrie and the 986 hp Valhalla hybrids, plus a Vanquish Vision concept and Valkyrie AMR Pro concept, not to mention the electric offerings from its Lagonda department. They follow the precedent from the One-77 and Vulcan supercars that came in the years before. It’s quite a different mood for what used to be a staid, small automaker tucked into the verdant hills of England’s Cotswolds region.
Many supercars, such as the $2.72 million Mercedes-AMG Project One limited-to-275 hybrid supercar based on Mercedes’s Formula 1 car, are sold as concepts, or very rough prototypes, and require six- or seven-figure deposits years in advance to ensure delivery. Others are sold with even less—a few sketches, a rendering, a foam-filled shell at an auto show. That’s if you can even get on the list to buy one. The official party line for most, like the Lambo, is that they have sold out before they’re even seen.
Some collectors are starting to find the rigmarole rather tedious.
“We need an awakening and cleansing soon to get everyone back into reality,” says Dan Kang, the well-known car collector based in Southern California, who owns a McLaren Senna, a Guntherwerks Porsche 911, and Lamborghini Centenario in similar carbon fiber livery, among other supercars. “It’s not even the new companies, but the current heritage brands as well, who feel they can demand the new price points without much substance. They need to support what they have already sold—not what [car] they can shovel up next.”
When manufacturers are unveiling cars that can’t be driven for years to come, and the very people able to afford them are over the hype anyway, it raises the question: Have we reached peak supercar?
Modern supercars, and their higher-end cousins, hypercars—both relative terms defined largely by whom you ask—are latecomers to the thread of automotive history. First, there were the rockets of their time, such as the Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows of the 1930s and 300SL Gullwings of the 1950s. In the 1960s, the Ferrari 250 GTOs dominated countless races and reached automotive immortality as the ultimate auction house blue-chip buys. But the supercar as we know it really came into its own in the late 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s, when hedonism reigned supreme. Such early examples as the Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari F40 set major precedents for design and performance. They were like space ships, compared the mundane and affordable metal boxes of the day. Everyone has a favorite; just ask the guys down at the weekend coffee klatch about the Vector, the Ferrari Enzo, or the Porsche Carrera GT. You’ll get a reaction.
They were duly expensive. A Countach sold for $72,000 at the time, or the equivalent of $375,000 today; the F40 cost $400,000, or the equivalent of $884,000 today.
Supercars tend to age well if you have the patience, luck, and financing to get your hands on one: On Aug. 16 in Monterey, Calif., a 1994 McLaren F1 sold for $19.8 million, obliterating the previous high-price paid for a McLaren: $13.75 million in 2015. (Its original MSRP was  around $1 million.) You won’t be surprised to learn that the man who designed that car, Gordon Murray, is now designing a round of 100 new supercars tentatively called the T50 and priced near $3 million.
The role of the supercar used to be to act as the halo for the brand, to attract media attention and consumer hype to a marque. Even if only a few people could afford to actually buy the exciting, sexy car, they’d know about the brand because of it and then buy something more affordable. Automakers figured that if you loved, or at least knew about, the  Acura NSX that Formula 1 champion Aryton Senna helped develop, you’d be more likely to buy an Accord. It seems a stretch—but the basic awareness of a brand is half the battle, marketers say. And an NSX is a lot more likely to grab headlines than an Accord is.
Supercars also carried the advanced driving technologies consumers could expect to see seep into the rest of the product lineup in succeeding years. The SF90 Stradale that Ferrari debuted in May is the first plug-in hybrid in Ferrari’s history, with a 679-horsepower twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 paired to the brand’s first-ever hybrid motor. Its gasoline engine and trio of electric motors combined make it the most powerful Ferrari ever, totaling 968 horsepower.
In fact, the SF90 is the latest in an onslaught of supercars that has taken a slightly different tone.
Supercars are increasingly electric, rather than powered by the galloping V12 and W16 engines of old. The Aston Martin Valkyrie,  Koenigsegg Jesko,  Lotus Evija, Mercedes-Benz Project One, and  Pininfarina Battista, among others, all use electric motors to help boost them to ever-higher (at least in theory) feats of speed and strength. They all have yet to hit the market in production form.
They’re coming from all sides of the market, too: such big, old heritage brands as Lamborghini and Ferrari, of course, but also from namesake novelty brands such as Gordon Murray Automotive and just-minted startups dotting the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Korea, Japan and China. These boutiques tend to have obscure names and opaque origins, blending the lines among automotive companies, tech companies, and software startups. Witness the British Dendrobium D1 and Ariel P40, the Chinese XING Mobility Miss E, the Croatian Rimac Concept_One, and the Japanese Aspark Owl. They come and go in the automotive consciousness, many making a splash at a car show with a foam mold or rendering, trotting that same car around for a year or two, then quietly merging with a larger auto or tech company, or shutting down altogether.
Rather than loss-leaders for the brand, they’re now a big part of the business model—or the business model.
“Basically, [the deposits to the supercar startups are] seed money to get operations up and running—applied to the cost of the car,” says Kevin Tynan, senior automotive analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of it as venture capital, with the return being a supercar instead of a percentage.”
In November, Lamborghini announced the one-off Lamborghini SC18 Alston, created for a single customer at a multimillion-dollar cost. 
It was a strategy that took cues from the Lamborghini Reventon: When it debuted, its almost immediate sell-out success of all 20 models to Middle Eastern sheiks and Russian billionaires proved to Lamborghini brass that the market could handle the extravagant price and exclusivity of vehicles heretofore considered too wild for it to bear. This paved the way for the $4.5 million Veneno and the aforementioned, 759-horsepower Centenario, rare-as-plutonium supercars that came several years later.
Reggiani characterized the one-offs as a not-insignificant part of Lamborghini’s bottom line, though he declined to give a percentage.
Elsewhere, Ferrari, which announced a Special Projects Division 10 years ago, has built one-off cars such as the Superamerica 45 and the P540 Superfast Aperta. Aston Martin has quietly made such one-offs as the CC100 and Valkyrie hybrid; McLaren made the 1,035-hp hybrid Speedtail.
“The sky is the limit,” Bugatti chief Stephan Winkelmann said this summer at the Villa d’Este Concours d’Elegance. The company had just unveiled the La Voiture Noir car purchased by Ferdinand Piëch, the notorious Volksagen boss who died Aug 25. The car cost nearly $19 million, after taxes and fees.
Proponents, and corporate press materials, rave about the shocking designs and extensive technologies of these extreme supercars, but their proliferation has simultaneously spurred the customary cadre of critics. Those skeptics—or, maybe, prophets—point to a whole lot of empty promises from the automakers and question their connection to reality, whether now or later.
There’s no question that in the future the world is going to have to change. Consumers will have to find sustainable transportation, says Jim Glickenhaus, who makes road-legal hypercars and supercars of his own. But he notes that his wife’s Tesla S is already much faster than she could ever drive it on public roads, both legally and logistically.
“Where are you going to drive a 2,000-horsepower electric supercar? You’ll run out of road,” he says. “I already get a headache in the Tesla! And now we’re getting 2,000-horsepower hyper-electric cars? Seriously. Why you would ever need a 2000-horsepower electric hypercar? I just don’t understand. You’re never going to drive a hypercar to pick up groceries.”
Not that any of the people who currently own the few electric hypercars that have actually come to market ever go grocery shopping; the idea is that there is a finite and very small market for that type of car at all, and we are near reaching the saturation point. Call it hypercar fatigue, contagious only among those who have been buying the hypercars in the first place.
Many of the new supercars are not legal to bring into the United States under normal permitting, anyway. They’re legal only to “show and display,” not to drive on public roads, because they don’t meet federal safety and emissions regulations. The Ferrari Icona Series Monza SP1 and SP2 cars, for instance, are legal for track use only.
Not that it matters. Follow Kang on Instagram or Mattress King collector Michael Fux for any length of time, and you’ll see they drive their more-practical Porsches and Rolls-Royces more than the hypercars they hoard. (Fux recently pulled up to Manhattan's Cipriani restaurant in his white Rolls, for instance, rather than his green Senna.) Peruse the auction catalogues of any major sale, browse through the feed of wealthy Youtube go-getters, or ask the young scions of Saudi families: They’re all bragging about how few miles their supercar has on the odometer, not about the great drive they took up the coast, say. 
The popular thing for younger, newer collectors seems to be not driving your car, instead of driving it—a drastic change from the longstanding tradition of the best, most hallowed cars earning their stripes by taking epic drives, winning adventure races, and parading through Paris.
“This whole modern supercar-hypercar market is destined to collapse under its own weight and implode on itself,” says Winston Goodfellow, an automotive author and analyst who judged the  Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance last month. “After all, if the things aren’t being utilized for their original purpose, there are only so many suckers and cult members out there who will agree that this weird Kool Aid actually tastes good and makes sense to drink.”
There are other cracks in the proverbial armor. Mercedes-AMG has yet to deliver any of the Project One cars it promised nearly three years ago. (Deliveries are set for 2021, according to a Mercedes spokesman.) So does Ariel, with the P40 it announced in 2017; Aspark, with the undelivered Owls it announced in 2018; and XING, with the Miss R it announced in 2017. Dendrobium, which announced the D1 last year and has said it would be ready by 2022, is already pointing to Brexit as a reason why it may not be able to deliver on its promises.
“So many investors have said to us that they’re keen but need some resolution one way or another,” Dendrobium boss Nigel Gordon-Stewart told Top Gear. 
Indeed. Read through the fine lines of press releases about the new supercars and you’ll see phrases like “working toward being fully funded” and “working to develop a technology partner,” verbal cues that the company is far from anywhere near being able to make production cars. Faraday Future unveiled an electric hypercar concept called the FFZERO1 in 2016 without even having a factory—or the money to build one. It has yet to produce any cars.
Then there’s the fact that the values of the first supercars are slumping. The McLaren F1 that sold in Monterey set a record—but failed to match even the low end of its estimated value before the sale. At the Gooding & Co. auctions in Arizona earlier this year, a 1990 Countach failed to reach even its low value estimate of $275,000; so did a Ferrari Testarossa listed for $250,000-$300,000 that sold for (just) $221,200. 
The automakers themselves remain notoriously cagey about exactly how supercar sales have been faring. Many blast instant- or near-immediate sell-out numbers in press releases, while other—when asked privately and perhaps more transparently—say that roughly half sold very early, and the rest are expected to sell in the coming weeks. Bugatti, one of the more forthcoming of the lot, has said that this applies to its Centodieci. It famously had to sell only one of the La Voiture Noire cars, anyway the one that went to Piech.  
It’s telling, if anecdotal, that public sentiment may be shifting. Locals near one of the biggest annual supercar gatherings in the world—on Cannery Row in Monterey during car week—even succeeded in getting it canceled this year amid complaints of noise and general disruption. Please don’t “hoon” around in your Lamborghini, one Instagram user requested.  
It was a blow to the automotive “influencers” who are the prime targets for the hypercars—to their egos, at least. After all, if you can’t show off your supercar on social media, is it even really yours, bro?
“The pendulum has already started to swing. It’s just that people don’t notice it because all these manufacturers are flooding the market with new product and obfuscating the view,” says Goodfellow. “When you have companies selling things that can’t even be driven on the street—and no one thinks this is weird—there is real distortion.”

Major chain stores including Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s have all recently reported healthy sales numbers, showing that Americans are confident enough to tune out trade wars, literal wars, global economic fragility, angry presidential tweets, the disappointing end to “Games of Thrones” and other problems. 
Sarah Halzack writes that Target Corp. is capitalizing on people’s propensity to spend by introducing appealing in-house brands of apparel and food, and by stressing store pickups of merchandise ordered online. As long as retailers deliver what shoppers want, Sarah says, nothing seems to stop Americans’ red, white and blue shopping carts full of stuff — at least for now. 
Conor Sen also finds proof of the strong U.S. consumer economy in the form of a chicken sandwich that has set off a social media frenzy. 
Good economic times tend to be when fast-food restaurants come out with an iconic menu item— in a stealth effort to raise prices and offset rising costs. The Big Mac and the Whopper debuted during times of low unemployment. Now, Conor says, the Popeyes $3.99 chicken sandwich and plant-based burgers on offer at other fast-food chains are signs that restaurants believe people are feeling good enough to embrace better menu items at premium prices. Economic health can’t last forever, but fried chicken on a brioche bun may endure. 
You know what isn’t great for a retailer? Walmart Inc. this week sued Tesla Inc. over claims that the electric car maker’s solar panel business — created after its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity — botched installations at Walmart stores and sparked several electrical fires on store roofs. (Tesla’s lawyer blamed Walmart for “breaches of contract” and “bad faith.”) The Walmart litigation, Liam Denning says, “adds to the sense that SolarCity was a deal that Tesla didn’t need and which has  ultimately burdened its resources and now maybe its reputation, too.”
Poverty or economic inequality are widely seen as the reasons for resentments flaring up in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir, and in Hong Kong. But economic grievances are not the primary force behind discontent in either place, Mihir Sharma writes. The deeper issue is identity, and protesters are worried about distant central governments paring back what little autonomy citizens have. These trends are evident from Britain to Ohio and beyond, Mihir writes. 
How would you like to loan someone $100 for 30 years, and after those decades you get less than $100 back? It sounds about as appealing as a root canal. But investors are so anxious about economic conditions, they’re willing to park money in safe government bonds, even if it means earning no interest. 
Fear, however, does have its limits. Germany didn’t have as many takers as it expected for a sale of government bonds that offered zero interest payments. Marcus Ashworth says these German bonds were a step too far, but this is hardly the end of negative-yielding debt. “This is the new normal,” Marcus declares, especially with the European Central Bank poised to buy debt in a bid to stem economic weakness.

Nothing can stop Americans from buying cartloads of stuff, or splurging on fast food. 
Americans are buying stuff! 
The world is a chaotic mess, but apparently there are no problems that shopping and fast food can’t solve. 
Major chain stores including Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s have all recently reported healthy sales numbers, showing that Americans are confident enough to tune out trade wars, literal wars, global economic fragility, angry presidential tweets, the disappointing end to “Game of Thrones” and other problems. 
Sarah Halzack writes that Target Corp. is capitalizing on people’s propensity to spend by introducing appealing in-house brands of apparel and food, and by stressing store pickups of merchandise ordered online. As long as retailers deliver what shoppers want, Sarah says, nothing seems to stop Americans’ red, white and blue shopping carts full of stuff — at least for now. 
Conor Sen also finds proof of the strong U.S. consumer economy in the form of a chicken sandwich that has set off a social media frenzy. 
Good economic times tend to be when fast-food restaurants come out with an iconic menu item— in a stealth effort to raise prices and offset rising costs. The Big Mac and the Whopper debuted during times of low unemployment. Now, Conor says, the Popeyes $3.99 chicken sandwich and plant-based burgers on offer at other fast-food chains are signs that restaurants believe people are feeling good enough to embrace better menu items at premium prices. Economic health can’t last forever, but fried chicken on a brioche bun may endure. 
You know what isn’t great for a retailer? Walmart Inc. this week sued Tesla Inc. over claims that the electric car maker’s solar panel business — created after its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity — botched installations at Walmart stores and sparked several electrical fires on store roofs. (Tesla’s lawyer blamed Walmart for “breaches of contract” and “bad faith.”) The Walmart litigation, Liam Denning says, “adds to the sense that SolarCity was a deal that Tesla didn’t need and which has  ultimately burdened its resources and now maybe its reputation, too.”
Poverty or economic inequality are widely seen as the reasons for resentments flaring up in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir, and in Hong Kong. But economic grievances are not the primary force behind discontent in either place, Mihir Sharma writes. The deeper issue is identity, and protesters are worried about distant central governments paring back what little autonomy citizens have. These trends are evident from Britain to Ohio and beyond, Mihir writes. 
How would you like to loan someone $100 for 30 years, and after those decades you get less than $100 back? It sounds about as appealing as a root canal. But investors are so anxious about economic conditions, they’re willing to park money in safe government bonds, even if it means earning no interest. 
Fear, however, does have its limits. Germany didn’t have as many takers as it expected for a sale of government bonds that offered zero interest payments. Marcus Ashworth says these German bonds were a step too far, but this is hardly the end of negative-yielding debt. “This is the new normal,” Marcus declares, especially with the European Central Bank poised to buy debt in a bid to stem economic weakness.

After two mass shootings within 24 hours earlier this month, President Trump backed “very meaningful” background checks for firearm purchases. Predictably, he then retreated, despite wide popular support for comprehensive background checks. 
Bloomberg’s editorial board throws cold water on Trump’s claims that the U.S. already has strong background checks, and says he is misguided in blaming mass gun deaths on a “mental health problem.” The editorial board says the president’s initial words show that even with Trump’s strong ties to the gun lobby, he  feels the political pressure to do the right thing. More pressure might actually bring long overdue change, the editorial board writes. 
It also took Trump less than 24 hours to backtrack on a couple of tax-cut ideas. On Tuesday, he suggested his administration was considering paring a payroll tax paid by American workers and their employers to fund Social Security and Medicare. On Wednesday, Trump said he is “not looking at a tax cut now.” 
Before this presidential flip-flop, Tyler Cowen wrote that economic theory suggests wages would adjust to a relatively small reduction in payroll taxes, and therefore employees wouldn’t see raises on a tax-adjusted basis. Politically, a temporary payroll tax could benefit  both the president and his opponents, Karl W. Smith said, by taking the issue off the table until after the 2022 midterm elections.

It was always going to be a tough sell. The world's first 30-year bond offering a zero coupon got a lukewarm response from investors today, falling well below Germany's target sales of €2 billion. Weak orders suggests negative yields across Europe may finally be taking their toll on investor demand. Here's a look at what was expected.
Boris Johnson wants to rally support for former Finance Minister George Osborne to become the next head of the IMF, a person familiar said. Johnson will use the G-7 meetings in Biarritz, France, this weekend to urge President Trump and other world leaders to support a U.K. bid for Osborne. A Briton has never run the IMF, and the new government may see it as a way to maintain its standing on the world stage after Brexit.
Italy's opposition is striving to avert an election and stop the League party from governing alone. A coalition between the Five Star Movement and the Democrats is emerging as an option after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte quit yesterday. President Mattarella has the sole power to appoint governments and call elections. ""It is now our turn to move and show the way ahead,"" Democrats leader Nicola Zingaretti said.
Ryanair's bid to block a strike by Irish pilots was upheld by a court in Dublin, while a hearing in London will determine whether U.K. crews can walk out ahead of the bank holiday—the busiest weekend for air travel. Members of the British Airline Pilots' Association and Ireland's Forsa are seeking a raise and the U.K. union had accused Ryanair of resorting to ""bullying tactics"" by taking the dispute to court.

A breakdown in communication may be cited as a reason for a lack of understanding among regulators about key design elements on the Boeing 737 Max until the first of the two crashes, a person familiar said. The safety feature that forced down the nose of the jets evolved during development and the changes weren't always flagged adequately.
Markets may be overreacting to other political events around the globe, but they're underreacting to those in Italy, John Authers writes for Bloomberg Opinion. In 2017, the prospect of Marine Le Pen—a very similar politician to Matteo Salvini—gaining the French presidency was enough to frighten investors to the core. Salvini's chances of taking power in Italy now look much higher than Le Pen's did then; the only alternative appears to be a dreadful mess.
It took the threat of a recession at home to get Germany to promise fiscal stimulus, but that isn't how the euro zone is meant to work, Ferdinando Giugliano writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Without a centralized pot of money, stronger countries like Germany should have acted much earlier to boost their own demand to help fellow members.
If Egypt is the Middle East's best-performing economy, why are more and more Egyptians becoming poorer, Amr Adly asks in Bloomberg Opinion. Instead of focusing primarily on GDP growth, international lenders should care more about where that growth occurs, and how it's redistributed through state expenditure and revenues so that more people reap the rewards.   
Zimbabwe's rulers are in a trap of their own making.

While electric cars are a realistic alternative to the century-old internal-combustion engine, the world's waterways are dominated by ships that belch plumes of diesel exhaust and heavy fuel oil.

Denmark's Queen Margrethe II has expressed her surprise at Donald Trump's decision to call off his state visit, following his unsuccessful attempt to acquire Greenland.

Scholz won the day after standing firm against demands from some in Merkel's Christian Democratic party to abolish the so-called solidarity surcharge completely.

The stock closed 31% higher at 8.48 Egyptian pounds, after shares were sold at 6.46 pounds in the IPO. The offering represented 36% of Fawry’s share capital and raised about 1.6 billion pounds ($97 million). EFG Hermes Holding managed the sale.
Fawry is an 11-year-old company that facilitates electronic bill-payments in urban neighborhoods, and counts 20 million Egyptians as customers, according to its website. Its retail network includes grocers and pharmacies. A tranche of the IPO offered to institutional investors was oversubscribed by 15.9 times, according to EFG Hermes.
Fawry is the first IPO on the EGX since Sarwa Capital in October 2018, as high interest rates attract investors to fixed income rather than equities. The government has delayed plans to offer stakes in some state-run companies, sales that were supposed to streamline the bloated public sector and turn around loss-making enterprises.
Following the “good reception” of the IPO, the stock will likely outperform within its first month of trading, said Amr Elalfy, the head of research at SHUAA Securities Egypt. More than 80% of subscribers were Egyptians, according to data from the bourse.
A stock stabilization fund managed by EFG Hermes will help sustain the stock price in the first month of trading. This measure “should support the stock holders from the public offering,” Elalfy said earlier this week. Potential risks to the stock’s performance include low liquidity, revenue and growth rates that fail to meet market expectations and weakening margins, he said.
The company has “exceptional growth potential,” said Allen Sandeep, director of research at Naeem Holding in Cairo. That contrasts with most companies in the same sector in emerging markets that are making losses, he said.

The 106-year-old automaker is working hard to beat a few imposing obstacles, from a limp IPO to historically low production volume.
Aston Martin officially debuted the electric Rapide E last month at the Shanghai Auto Show—nearly four years after its initial announcement about the car.
Based on the V12-powered Rapide, the sedan will arrive in one small batch, with a scant 155 “special edition” cars produced. But contrary to widespread speculation, it won’t star in the upcoming 25th installment of the James Bond franchise.
It would have been a somewhat unexpected product placement anyway, considering Bond’s image as a well-dressed rule-breaker, rather than a well-dressed environmentalist. And Great Britain’s 106-year-old company has plenty of bigger problems that even Bond himself wouldn’t be able to fix.
When Deutsche Bank revised its outlook for Aston Martin on April 8 to a more negative view, its shares plummeted, finally settling down by market’s close at half of October’s initial public offering price of  19 pounds ($24.70). That figure  gave the company a market capitalization of 4.1 billion pounds. Analysts cited “higher volatility in demand” and “limited share price potential” as factors leading to the downgrade. (The company had announced a $190 million note issue to generate more funds April 3.)
Last year’s IPO fell completely  flat, and uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the general cooling of the automotive market has done much to shake investor confidence in the iconic English marque. Aston Martin is currently worth less than one-fifth the value of its rival Ferrari, a company Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer had said his brand’s own value would exceed when it made its debut as a public company.  
“We’ve taken 105 years to get to an IPO. We’re not going to worry much on what the initial shares are doing,” Palmer said in an interview with Bloomberg TV after it went public. “We will always look over the longer term.”
One challenge Aston must face is its historically low production numbers. Last year the brand sold fewer than 6,500 vehicles worldwide, far less than even Porsche, let alone BMW or Mercedes-Benz. That exclusivity has always been part of the brand’s cachet, but to increasingly diminishing returns. In this day and age, when trucks and SUVs reign supreme, car companies must sell lots of vehicles to stay afloat. Even arch-rival Ferrari has announced plans to make an SUV. 
Meanwhile, Aston Martin has been forced to give deep dealer incentives to jump-start sales of its new Vantage, a $150,000 coupe. The success of that car is crucial to overall corporate health, since as the lower-priced, lower-powered Aston Martin, it was intended to be its biggest seller. And although Aston Martin will report its best Q1 ever for North America this year, the IPO resulted in a pretax loss of £68 million ($89 million) for 2018.
“They haven’t had the right product cadence yet,” says Kevin Tynan, the lead automotive analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “If anything they’ve been a little quiet while all of this news is happening around them. If you were a conspiracy theorist, you’d be worried about [where they are getting] funding.”  
Of course, Tynan notes, quiet doesn’t necessarily mean inactive. If you look carefully, Aston Martin is fighting its demons using the good old-fashioned multi-pronged approach.
Kris Singh is a young investor from Miami who spends millions of dollars at auto shows each year buying whatever he wants.
What he wants lately are hybrid supercars.
At the Geneva Motor Show in March, Singh reserved for himself the Aston Martin AM-RB 003, a $2 million hybrid that will start production in 2021. The hypercar was among the most-feted debuts at the year’s most exciting show, but it’s far from Aston Martin’s first million-dollar hybrid. The $3 million Valkyrie, which runs on a V12 engine paired with a lightweight electric motor, sold out almost instantly when it debuted in 2017, even though it will be later this year before its buyers can take it home.
Creating a halo around an electrified supercar is mandatory these days if you want to be like Ferrari. McLaren, Ferrari, Porsche, Pininfarina, and Mercedes-Benz all already make and sell—for very high margins—hybrid or all-electric supercars like the Pininfarina Battista and Ferrari LaFerrari.
Aston Martin declined to comment on the specific margins the company makes on such cars but a spokesperson did note that “specials” like the AM-RB 003 and the Aston Martin Valkyrie have a “significant impact” on the company’s average selling price. In 2018, the average selling price per vehicle at Aston Martin was £141,000 ($184,460) excluding special cars. It was £157,000 ($205,390) including them. 
Plus, with a decades-long Formula 1 and endurance racing heritage bolstering the credentials of some of the best-driving sports cars on the market, the car highlights one area where the brand can excel, Tynan says, even if it is in extremely low volumes. The company will make fewer than 500 of them for worldwide distribution. 
“Honestly my opinion is that Aston Martin is in a pretty good spot in terms of this whole hypercar and electrification thing,” he says. “People still want their hypercars. They want performance, and they’re willing to pay for it. Aston Martin won’t have to change who they are to fit into the evolution of what’s going on with the industry.”
With their instant torque and less-demanding range demands, it’s no accident that the Valkyrie and AM-RB 003 were Aston Martin’s first major electric-boosted endeavors to get legs. Their intergalactic body styles and high level of customization provide lightning-rod excitement for the brand, while the technology inside them will trickle down to more affordable wares, all of which will be available in hybrid or pure-electric form by 2025, Palmer said. 
Indeed, real-world electric driving performance is where Aston Martin can gain more market foothold. By the end of this year, global sales of electric vehicles will hit 2 million, up from 1.2 million in 2017, according to Frost & Sullivan’s Global Electric Vehicle Market Outlook 2018 report.
Though it’s trotting out the all-electric Rapide E at auto shows, the brand is far behind the rest of the pack. Tesla continues to steer the market segment for premium sedans and SUVs with its waiting-list-only Models S, 3 and X. Porsche will be selling the much-anticipated Taycan sedan by November. Audi and Jaguar are already selling excellent electric SUVs; BMW and Mercedes-Benz will be selling their own later this year.
What’s more, the race is intensifying. Porsche has said half of its vehicles will be electric by 2023, and BMW says it will do 25 electrified vehicles by 2025. To have a chance of keeping up, Aston Martin must show that it can make reliable daily drivers just as well as it makes track stars—those, ultimately, are where the bread-and-butter profits will derive. 
“There are plenty of customers who are high net worth and for whom sustainability is important,” says Ian Fletcher, the principal analyst at IHS Market, an automotive research firm. “Does Aston need to have something more than an electric Rapide E? Of course. But they’re moving forward with their [long-term] strategy, and at the end of the day, they just need to keep pedaling.”  
The brand is also aiming to launch a top-tier SUV to compete with the Porsche Cayenne and Macan, the Bentley Bentayga, and the Lamborghini Urus. It’s a tactic that’s worked for Bentley, which has doubled production numbers with its new Bentayga, and for Porsche, whose $50,000 Macan is the company’s best-selling vehicle. Scheduled for its official unveiling by the end of 2019, with sales in 2020, the DBX is intended to do the same kind of heavy lifting—Aston wants to double its total production by 2023, Palmer said, when the company will make 14,000 total vehicles worldwide.
“I think [DBX] bodes well for the brand,” says Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst for IHS Markit. “Aston Martin is a brand defined by being highly beautiful and highly powerful, but it’s a little less edgy than a Lamborghini, so it naturally fits in that space [of SUVs and crossovers] to begin with.” 
It’s a big step up. In 2018, Aston Martin sold 6,441 vehicles total, up 26 percent, year over year. It will likely sell 7,300 in 2019, a spokeswoman said. But the hope is that DBX will have a natural home in North America, with its insatiable lust for crossovers and SUVs. In 2016, SUV sales in the U.S. surpassed those of cars. By 2022, Americans will have  more new SUVs from which to choose than cars.
Elsewhere, Aston Martin’s Atlas of an SUV must also heave onto its shoulders the responsibility of raising market share in China again after a 31 percent jump in sales last year. It’s a can’t-miss opportunity to pounce where rivals like Jaguar Land Rover and Daimler have seen sales stumble.
And the brand must attract more women buyers, an audience Aston Martin has sought since 2015, with indeterminate results. In 2017, the company created a “female advisory panel” to review and provide feedback on current and future products. Last year it scrambled to name a woman to its formerly all-male board. Laura Schwab became president of the Aston Martin Americas division in 2015. Through a representative, both Palmer and Schwab declined to be interviewed for this story.
“Aston Martin is in a good position here,” Brinley says. “When you go into the utility vehicle space, that naturally opens you up to more women.”
The stopgap, until DBX, is Vantage. At least, it should have been. In March, Aston Martin North America sold 93 Vantages out of its 182 total cars sold, its second-best month since the car was introduced. But the company’s ongoing and hefty financing payouts for the sinuous coupe have suggested Aston Martin buyers aren’t as excited as they might be. Steve Serio, the Aston Martin dealer in Boston, said he’s had multiple Vantages languish for months on his showroom floor before they sell.
“My buyers are 98 percent male and between the ages of 40 and 65,” Serio said. They buy rather than lease their cars as well—the exact types of drivers who prefer manual to paddle-shifting by a wide margin. The Vantage, however, is not currently available in North America with a stick-shift gearbox. A Vantage AMR version with manual transmission is due to arrive later this year, while the standard model Vantage will offer it starting in 2020. 
“It’s really the Vantage that’s the concern,” agreed Michael Dean, the senior analyst of European automotive for Bloomberg Intelligence. He noted the higher MSRPs for the new-generation model, which have created a subtle cooling effect on sales. He noted the polarizing new grille, which gapes at the front of the car like a catfish. And he noted that competitor Porsche’s excellent new 911 has received rave reviews.
“While the Vantage isn’t a key driver of earnings, it will impact sentiment toward the shares in the first half of the year,” Dean said.
Fortunately for Aston Martin, success in the automotive world is solidified over more time than the first half of this year. “It could be decades before things play out,” Tynan says.
Analyst Dean says Aston Martin has enough access to cash in 2019. Fletcher says it has well accounted for contingencies like Brexit and is optimistic in spite of a subtle downturn in global auto markets. “Aston Martin is one of the most bullish despite everything,” he notes. 
The analysts agree that if the company can stay conservative with cash expenditures while managing to produce high-performance products with such regularity that it becomes routine, it has a real chance of beating its current challenges.  
Unsurprisingly, Palmer himself has recommended taking a long view when evaluating the company’s fortunes.
“We said at the time of the IPO not to buy us if you are not going long term,” Palmer told Bloomberg in February. “It’s all about growth through 2023.”

Emaar Properties PJSC, the developer of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, and Aldar Properties PJSC in Abu Dhabi, have gained this year as better-than-expected results and appealing dividends attracted investors. Damac Properties PJSC, on the other hand, has extended its declines with more outflows on the radar.
U.A.E. real estate stocks have been battered in the past two years amid increasing supply and faltering demand as lower oil prices hurt economies across the Gulf. Dubai residential prices have dropped about 25 percent from a peak in 2014, according to Craig Plumb, head of Middle East research at broker Jones Lang LaSalle. He estimates a contraction in the single digits this year.
Emaar Properties and Aldar have entities tied to the local government as their main shareholders. Both have “succeeded in generating growth at the bottom of the cycle,” said Selima Mrabet, a financial analyst at Tunis-based equities research firm AlphaMena, warning that conditions are likely to remain difficult this year. “This move can only be sustained if it will be fueled by good news. The market needs to restore confidence in the real estate sector.”

Damac’s shares have declined 56 percent in the past 12 months and in February the company posted its lowest annual profit since going public in 2013. The stock could be excluded from MSCI Inc.’s main benchmarks in a review next month as it fails to meet technical requirements, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, an equities strategist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai. That could trigger further outflows, he said. It fell for a third session on Wednesday.
The company’s head of investor relations, Amr Aboushaban, said in an email that many of its future developments in Dubai have already been sold and that it’s “noting indications of market stabilization.”
Listen to a podcast on why Dubai’s real estate slump is no blip.
Damac is going through a “difficult journey” as its business model isn’t as flexible as its Dubai competitors because it only offers luxury developments, said Alphamena’s Mrabet. Oversupply and fierce competition will drop those who didn’t implement effective and efficient strategies “out of the race.”

On the plus side for him, according to his Attorney General William Barr, special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t accuse Trump or his campaign of conspiring with the Russian government to swing the 2016 election. The  question of collusion or no collusion – not an actual legal term, but still the benchmark by which Trump’s role in this has been judged, thanks mainly to Trump constantly yelling “NO COLLUSION!” – is now closed, writes Noah Feldman.
Mueller also punted to Barr the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, and Barr declined to run it back. But the AG dismissed obstruction too hastily,  writes Cass Sunstein, raising the odds that it will rear its head again. Mueller’s full report is still hidden, and until we see it all, we can’t know if Barr’s call was legitimate, Bloomberg’s editorial board writes.
What we already know from the probe is mortifying enough, notes Tim O’Brien, including the fact that Trump employed  many, many convicted criminals in his campaign and transition. Trump  claims the report marks a “Total EXONERATION!,” but his lawlessness in other areas is already out in the open, and he  still faces a raft of other investigations, Tim writes in a second column. Trump’s  impeachment risk is much lower in the AMR era, writes Jonathan Bernstein, but there are still grounds, and investigators are still looking for more.

British parliament is  due to vote tonight on whether to wrest the wheel of the Brexit clown car away from Theresa May. It probably won’t, but the prime minister still lacks the votes for her Brexit deal, which parliament has already rejected twice. With a new, slightly extended Brexit deadline still coming soon and no plan in sight, the actually  good idea of simply canceling Brexit is gaining political steam, even among some Brexit supporters, writes Therese Raphael. Alas, the politics are still too dicey to make this a real possibility, Therese adds. 
Further Brexit Reading:
Markets are still  grappling with the implications of the yield curve inverting – short-term rates going higher than long-term rates, a predictor of the past several recessions. Mohamed El-Erian writes there are many reasons to think, gulp,  it’s different this time – although he adds fears about the yield curve could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. And the yield curve isn’t the only recession signal flashing: Mark Whitehouse notes  economists’ forecasts have started to diverge noticeably, which has happened in each of the past three recessions.

As Tara Lachapelle  wrote recently, Warren Buffett has been sitting on an unusually large mountain of cash for an unusually long time. He is overdue, Tara writes in a new column, for what may be  one last “elephant-sized” deal. The big question is what might be a suitable target. With her understanding of the kinds of companies Buffett has acquired in the past, Tara has come up with a list of 20 possible purchases, including a certain American airplane-maker in hot water lately. See  the list here.
OPEC+ wants to delay a decision on ending its production cuts until June, but that  won’t give it any more clarity about the outlook for oil demand, writes Julian Lee.
On the surface, Tesla Inc. has done a lot right lately, but  investors see mainly desperation driving it, writes Liam Denning.

Muffman. But the story also resonates because it confirms our prior beliefs about the sorry state of the world. 
The rich always use money and connections to help their offspring, and this is more of the same, if only more hilarious and criminal than usual. The dark side of it is that the conditions motivating such behavior are getting worse: Widening inequality is making social networks (the old-fashioned kind; though being an Instagram influencer apparently doesn’t hurt) increasingly vital, writes Leonid Bershidsky, in a way that  reminds him uncomfortably of the status quo in Russia and former Soviet republics. If we could make college more about quality education and didn’t give outsize rewards to those who game the system, then incentives to cheat would fade. (It would also help, as Tyler Cowen wrote yesterday, if colleges weren’t so  afraid to flunk unqualified kids.) 
While we’re at it, we should also  stop giving college athletic coaches the god-like power to admit athletic recruits, writes Noah Feldman. This was a systemic flaw the alleged perps exploited after they learned merely buying a building wasn’t enough to get their kids into Yale. A coach, on the other hand, can admit anybody who can fog a mirror or photoshop themselves into a pole-vault.
And what’s truly nuts about all of this is that it   doesn’t matter where you go to school. Joe Nocera runs through a long list of the many wealthy, successful business leaders, including Tim Cook and Warren Buffett, who did not get degrees from fancy colleges. Going to Harvard may help you get that first job, but it won’t help you become, for example, the CEO. 
After watching the rest of the world go first, the FAA finally  grounded Boeing Co.,’s 737 Max 8 airplane, which has been involved in two fatal crashes in the past five months. This was obviously the proper call, but it only came after several days of Boeing and the FAA repeatedly declaring the plane was perfectly fine to keep flying, Brooke Sutherland notes. Now Boeing still must take the bottom-line hit of grounding the plane and addressing its issues, but blew its chance at getting reputational credit  for doing the right thing right away, Brooke writes.
A day after routing Theresa May’s Brexit deal, parliament voted against leaving the EU with no deal at all. So that disastrous outcome will be avoided, at least – but only temporarily. Currency traders have been vigorously buying the British pound, apparently believing many bad outcomes will be avoided, notes Lionel Laurent. That’s dangerous, because  most options available to the U.K. still look very bad; and even the worst outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit, are still on the table, Lionel writes. 
Further Brexit Reading: 
One of the worst features of America’s health-care system is the stroke-inducing medical bill you often get after a hospital stay. This happens so often there’s a name for it: “balance billing.” This is when every provider you see in a medical emergency is, darn the luck, out of your insurance network, and you personally get billed the GDP of a small nation for it. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are working on a fix, Bloomberg’s editorial board writes, and  Congress needs to approve it quickly.
The Trump administration and Congress, meanwhile, keep poking at the problem of exorbitant drug prices, in ways that occasionally threaten the profits of drug makers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. This could inspire these companies to take matters into their own hands. Insurance giant UnitedHealth Group Inc., for example, just announced a drug-rebate plan that favors patients –and could also help fend off more regulation, writes Max Nisen.
Big Tech’s power has led to a revival of interest in antitrust law, with Elizabeth Warren and others calling to split up giants such as Facebook Inc. and Google. But a new U.K. study proposes regulators could instead try to zero in on problematic Big Tech practices, halting them immediately when necessary. This make more sense, and is a bigger threat to the giants, than the blunt approach of breakups, writes Alex Webb. 
Noah Smith, meanwhile, suggests the challenges of the future, from climate change to China’s geopolitical ambitions, could mean the government would be  better off harnessing Big Tech rather than destroying it.

Most of them are electric. 
Most of them are electric.

When it comes to the most expensive luxury cars, auto shows are increasingly irrelevant.
For years, the most prestigious automakers in the world have saved their best debuts—and the bulk of their event marketing budgets—for such glamorous locales as the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, the Goodwood Festival of Speed, and the Villa d’Este at Lake Como. Auto shows may draw a lot of people, but with their fluorescent lighting and retro carpeting, they’re hardly a seductive showcase for wealthy private buyers.
The exception is the  Geneva Motor Show. 
With press days starting next week and a public opening to run from March 7 to 17, the annual event near Lake Leman will be the first gilded showcase of the year for the likes of  Bugatti,  Koenigsegg,  Lamborghini, and  Pininfarina, among others.
“Auto shows for automakers to send messages to each other—or basically, just show off—are going away. That has gotten really expensive,” says Matt DeLorenzo, the senior managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. “The only show that has that still really going on is Geneva. This is where the Italian design houses and the Bentleys and Bugattis of the world can really show off, and they do.”
Credit the attitude partly to the fact that no major automaker makes its headquarters in Switzerland, so the country is in spiritually neutral territory, unlike New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Frankfurt, or Tokyo.
“In Geneva, they actually sell cars to really rich people,” DeLorenzo adds, noting that the region holds some of the world’s wealthiest people, who are happy to deign to visit the Palexpo center, where the show is held. At least it’s near the likes of the Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, and Jaeger-LeCoultre watch houses. “Aston Martin may skip a show in the U.S., but they’ll be at the Geneva show with a full product line, selling cars from the stand. It’s a totally different dynamic than any other car show on the face of the Earth.”
Where the fashion world flocks to Paris for its seasonal runway spectacles, tout le monde from the elite automotive world convenes in Geneva.
This year in Geneva has turned the hypercar knob three clicks to the right. Koenigsegg will bring a much-anticipated successor to the  world record-setting Agera RS; Pininfarina will show the its first-ever production car, an expected all-electric, 1,900hp, elegant beast; and Bugatti may bring an $18 million modern take on the iconic Atlantic from 1936. That’s just the start.
Each of the supercar brands in attendance is cashing in on the global appetite for extremely expensive, extremely limited editions of cars from heritage brands. It’s a market that seems to be stable, if only in small quantities. When your cars cost  $2 million each, you don’t have to sell many to survive.
“These types of cars are being built in the 10s,” DeLorenzo said. “There are certainly enough people who want to have one of 10 of something. Or even one of 100.”
French brand Bugatti will show an “110 ans Bugatti” tribute Bugatti Chiron Sport to celebrate the anniversary of the brand’s founding in 1909. That is the latest of the Chiron series and follows the  $5.8 million Divo that Bugatti brought to Pebble Beach last August. More spectacular though, and currently secret, will be a second Bugatti car with a rumored $18 million price tag. It may be a modern take on the iconic Bugatti 57 SC Atlantic that Bugatti has announced it will also bring to Geneva; the new one-off version is rumored to have been commissioned by former Volkswagen Group chief Ferdinand Pieech.  
Sweden’s Koenigsegg will bring the much-anticipated successor to the Agera RS, code-named Ragnarok, which is a term from Norse mythology that connotes the apocalypse. Company executives have said that the model they will show in Geneva may not carry that name, but they expect it boast an update to the twin-turbo, 5.0-liter V8 engine in the Agera RS, with horsepower above 1,360. And a whale of a tail. 
Italy’s dual pride and joys—Ferrari and Lamborghini—will each bring supercars to Geneva, though they’ll likely be divided in purpose. Ferrari has announced it will bring the  F8 Tributo, the evolution of the 488, a turbocharged V8 with 710 horsepower and a six-figure price tag. (To the untrained eye, it looks just like the 488.) 
Lamborghini will bring the edgy Huracán Evo Spyder, a tuned-up open-top version of its segment-leading  Huracán. The Evo, a higher-powered, 5.2-liter, V10 engine that produces 640 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque. It’s so fast it will get to 62 miles per hour in just 3.1 seconds, with a top speed of 202 mph. That’s slower than the new  McLaren 600LT Spider and  McLaren 720S Spider, though perhaps more visceral—and louder—to drive.
In the meantime, Alfa Romeo will bring Giulia Quadrifoglio and Stelvio Quadrifoglio “Alfa Romeo Racing” limited editions made to honor the brand’s return to Formula 1. Showgoers will also see the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti, or “Turismo Internazionale,” and the new Alfa Romeo Giulietta. 
The British will invade Geneva, too: Aston Martin is going to debut the Project 003, the third high-performance, mid-engine car the company has built in recent years, following the $2.6 million Aston Martin Valkyrie and Valkyrie AMR Pro. (Those cars were called “001” and “002,” respectively). It’s expected that Project 003 is some sort of street version of the Valkyrie and  will go on sale by 2021. 
There are plenty of other lesser-known—but, in some cases, no less outré—new cars to see this year in Geneva. Many come from small, heritage-house automotive jewels, obscure startups, or once-dormant brands from around the globe.
Count  Pininfarina’s Battista foremost among the lot. The 89-year-old Italian design house famed for outfitting yachts and Ferraris has said it will make just 150 of the electric marvel to sell at a price of more than $2 million.
The 1,900-horsepower electric supercar is said to have a top speed of 250mph and a driving range of 300 miles under all-electric power. It looks stunning: slender LED headlights grab attention in the absence of a conventional front grill, and a wide light spans from one headlight to the other, acting as a daytime running light system. Its sleek body recalls the PFO that Pininfarina showed reporters at Pebble Beach last August. 
Hispano Suiza, the Spanish car company originally founded in 1904, will bring an electric car, too: the Carmen. It’s an all-electric grand tourer based on the unforgettable, art deco-style, 1938 Hispano-Suiza H6B Dubonnet Xenia. The historic company hopes to use the Barcelona-made car to relaunch itself back into the car-making business—and it’s accepting pre-orders now.
And Ginetta, a 61-year-old small British racing company based in Leeds, England, will show a half-million-dollar V8 supercar it has teased online. Ginetta says its 600-plus-horsepower car will have a top speed of 200mph, though it has yet to announce the name publicly.
It better be something good. We’ve already got everything from a 003 to a Ragnarok. This year in Geneva, it’s going to be hard to stand out.

“Four years isn’t enough,” Mahmoud Badr, one of the proposal’s sponsors, told talk show host Amr Adib late Saturday. About 125 of Egypt’s 596 legislators had signed the petition, and they’re still debating whether the change would affect El-Sisi’s second term alone or apply retroactively to his first term, Badr said.
Parliament Speaker Ali Abdel-Aal said Sunday he had referred the petition to committee. The term extension would have to be approved by parliament and in a national referendum because it would require a constitutional amendment. El-Sisi’s current term is to expire in 2022.
Momentum has been building for some time to either remove the current two-term limit or extend the length of the terms. A separate petition is currently before a Cairo urgent matters court.
Even before El-Sisi was re-elected to his second term last year, several lawmakers suggested amending the charter. The move was quickly shelved, however, amid concerns it would look like an El-Sisi power grab.
The former general-turned-president has repeatedly said he serves at the pleasure of Egyptians and has no ambition to become another “pharaoh,” as his predecessor, longtime autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak, was dubbed.
But even before winning his first election in 2014, El-Sisi launched a sweeping crackdown on Islamists that has also expanded to include activists and other potential opponents. In the 2018 presidential elections, all major challengers either bowed out, or were arrested or disqualified. The man who emerged at the last minute to run against him was an ardent supporter who won less than 4 percent of the vote.
An Irritated El-Sisi Says It’s Time the State Gets Its Due
The petition also proposed amending the constitution to ensure there is at least one vice president, revive parliament’s upper house, require that women make up at least 25 percent of parliament, and charge the military with safeguarding the state’s civilian status.

Almost 15 months after rounding up dozens of Saudi Arabia’s richest and most powerful people and imprisoning them in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has declared the raid a lucrative success.
An anti-corruption commission headed by the crown prince said a total of about $107 billion -- a mix of cash, real estate, companies and securities -- has been recovered from 87 people.
Aside from confirming a $1 billion payment from the former head of the National Guard, the government has said little about the nature of the individual settlements. Less than four months ago, the crown prince told Bloomberg News that $35 billion had been collected from the prisoners. Verifying the commission’s claims is made more challenging by the opacity of the Saudi market. Closely held companies rarely disclose financials and the value of real estate -- the preferred asset of many wealthy Saudis -- is obscured by unrecorded transactions and restrictions on buyers.
Detainees have been trickling out of prison for more than a year. Saudi-Ethiopian billionaire Mohammed Al Amoudi, was freed just last Sunday after being held in an undisclosed location on bribery and corruption charges. Also released within the past few weeks: philanthropist and former government minister Amr Al-Dabbagh; former McKinsey & Co. partner Hani Khoja; and Sami Baroum, an ex-managing director of one of the kingdom’s biggest food companies.
Authorities have constrained post-prison life for many of those targeted, with travel bans and heightened surveillance within the country.
This is the latest status of four billionaires:
Date of release: January 2018Change in net worth since day before his arrest: down $4 billion to $15 billion
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud
Arguably the most high-profile target of the crackdown, Alwaleed was released after 83 days in detention, looking thinner but praising the kingdom’s leadership. He told Bloomberg News shortly afterward that he signed a confidential “confirmed understanding” with the government and that operations at his business empire were back to normal. Shares of his investment group, Kingdom Holding Co., have dropped 22 percent since his arrest.
Alwaleed, Saudi Arabia’s richest person, has a 95 percent stake in the company that comprises half of his net worth. In October, Kingdom Holding signed a $1 billion loan, its first financing since his arrest, and the firm’s chief executive officer said last month that it’s considering spinning off some real estate investments. Alwaleed, known to be a restless globetrotter, is said to have been banned from traveling abroad. He has about $2.6 billion of assets outside the Middle East.
Date of release: January 2019Change in net worth: down $1.4 billion to $8.7 billion
Al Amoudi standing with business managers Jason Milazzo and Roger Wikstrom after his release
Al Amoudi, the nation’s second-richest person, was released Jan. 27, six weeks after Saudi officials confirmed he was being held on corruption and bribery charges and would stand trial. His fortune originated with a government contract during the reign of King Fahd and is now mostly tied to assets outside the kingdom.
He owns the biggest fuel company in Sweden and is the largest individual investor in his native Ethiopia, where he owns gold mines, hotels and agricultural tracts. While his businesses abroad continued to operate independently during his detention, the status and control of his Saudi assets -- which include a chain of gas stations and an engineering firm -- is unclear. Al Amoudi is healthy and in good spirits and has met with senior managers of his companies, according to a person close to the billionaire, who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.
Date of release: January 2018Change in net worth: down $700 million to $3 billion
Kamel, a self-made finance and health-care entrepreneur, is a pioneer of modern Islamic finance. His fortune stems from Bahrain-based Albaraka Banking Group and Dallah Albaraka, a sprawling Jeddah holding company that controls businesses spanning health care, real estate and food manufacturing.

Kamel was also one of Saudi Arabia’s earliest media magnates. In the 1970s, he founded one of the country’s first television production companies and was an early investor in Middle East Broadcasting Center, a regional media giant whose chairman, Waleed Al Ibrahim, was also detained and released in January 2018.
After the emptying of the Ritz, the government took control of 60 percent of MBC, including shares belonging to the Kamel family, while Al Ibrahim retained his 40 percent share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Released: January 2018Change in net worth: down $520 million to about $950 million
Alhokair is a co-founder and major shareholder of the Fawaz Alhokair Group, a franchise retail company he formed with his brothers in 1990. He was freed after reaching a settlement with the government, a senior official said at the time.
The company is preparing to sell 30 percent of its shares in its Arabian Centres mall unit, a listing that had previously been put on hold because of Alhokair’s arrest. Shares of the company -- of which he owns 23 percent, according to recent Saudi stock exchange filings -- have tumbled 41 percent since his detention.

Saudi-Ethiopian billionaire Mohammed Al Amoudi was released more than a year after his arrest in what authorities said was a crackdown on corruption, becoming the latest detainee to be freed under mysterious circumstances.
Al Amoudi was let go after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed raised his case during a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, the premier’s office said. A Saudi official said in December that Al Amoudi was charged with corruption and would face trial.
Al Amoudi is the third-richest billionaire in the Middle East, with a fortune valued at $8.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was no official Saudi explanation of his release and it’s unclear whether he will be barred from leaving the kingdom, like some others who were freed.
The kingdom and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman have come under unprecedented global pressure after the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents at the country’s consulate in Istanbul in October.
Several other prominent detainees were released over the past few weeks, including Amr Al-Dabbagh -- a businessman who was formerly chief of the Saudi investment authority -- and Hani Khoja, a McKinsey & Co. partner who co-founded Elixir, a consultancy. Sami Baroum, former managing director of food processor Savola Group, was also freed, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Bakr Binladin, a Saudi billionaire who had headed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group, was briefly released to attend a family funeral but sent back to prison on Sunday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Al Amoudi was detained in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel in November 2017 along with dozens of princes, officials and businessmen as Prince Mohammed declared a campaign against corruption.
Critics denounced the purge as a power play and a shakedown, a charge the government denies. While most detainees were released last year, a few high-profile figures are still being held, including former Economy Minister Adel Fakeih and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah.
It’s unclear whether those sent home recently faced any charges or have gone through a settlement process; the government has not commented on or confirmed the releases.
Al Amoudi’s arrest was of particular interest to Ethiopia, where he owns vast assets. In May, after his visit to Saudi Arabia, Ahmed said that he had inquired after Al Amoudi and was sure he’d be freed soon.
Saudi authorities have also released two male associates of a group of prominent women’s rights activists who were arrested in May. Abdulaziz Al-Meshaal, a businessman and associate of the women, was released recently, according to people familiar with the matter, while lawyer Ibrahim Al-Modaimigh was released in December.

Damac Properties PJSC’s stock has plunged by about two-thirds in the past 12 months, while Emaar Malls PJSC and Emaar Development PJSC are both down 34 percent. That performance sets them up for exclusion from the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in May under the compiler’s criteria for membership in the gauge, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, equities strategist at the research arm of EFG-Hermes Holding Co. Their departure could lead to combined investment outflows of about $220 million, he said.
The three companies are by far the worst performers in 2019 among the eight stocks on Dubai’s real estate and construction index, a gauge that’s dropped in the past year as building in the emirate outpaced expected demand growth. The housing component of Dubai’s consumer-price index has fallen for all but three months since at least May 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The recent share-price losses put the developers out of the coverage range of compiler MSCI Inc.’s main emerging-market index, which considers only large and mid-cap stocks, according to Al Hajj. Added to that is the fact that they have low free-float levels, he said. Robert Ansari, head of Middle East business at MSCI, did not respond to a request for comment.
Read: Dubai Is Achilles Heel to EM’s Worst-Performing Property Stock
The companies have the lowest weight in the MSCI U.A.E. Index, which is used for calculating the main emerging-markets gauge. If deleted, they “will no longer benefit from passive inflows into EM beyond May,” Al Hajj said in an emailed response to questions. Removal would spark outflows of $80 million each for Emaar Development and Emaar Malls, and $60 million for Damac Properties, he estimated.
Under one scenario for the review, Abu-Dhabi based Aldar Properties PJSC could be considered the U.A.E. cutoff stock, with Damac being classified as a small-cap and Emaar Malls and Emaar Development being excluded for failing free float, Al Hajj said.
However, in a second scenario, if the foreign room for another U.A.E. index member, Dana Gas, is above 25 percent at the end of the review period, Damac will end up being the cutoff, potentially saving the status of Emaar Malls and Emaar Development. While too early to confirm, as the considered date is the end of April, “Damac is looking like a high probability deletion,” Al Hajj said.
Amr Aboushaban, investor relations chief at Damac, said the company qualifies under two of MSCI’s four criteria for remaining in the emerging-market measure, and “nothing is stopping us from meeting the additional requirements” as the developer works to reduce volatility in a cyclical stock market. Damac has “remained focused on the fundamentals of our business” after expecting the real-estate slowdown, enabling it to remain liquid and “capture opportunities,” he said.

Photographer: Catherine Hyland for Bloomberg Businessweek
Switzerland’s Andermatt has all the makings of an ultra-luxury ski destination.
The first time Egyptian real estate mogul Samih Sawiris took a helicopter ride over the sleepy Swiss ski village of Andermatt, 14 years ago, he was struck by its remote wildness. The resort was only a 90-minute drive from Zurich, yet it felt like a secret hidden in the mountains of Uri, arguably the rugged country’s least discovered canton.
What the silver-haired chairman of Orascom Development Holding AG must have also seen was a blank slate. The appeal of European ski resorts, unlike that of their purpose-built American counterparts, is their sense of history. Think skiing into farming villages steeped in tradition, where the slopes and hotels and restaurants have been attracting winter tourists for—in some cases—well over a century.
Andermatt offered exactly the opposite. This was a resort that, after two boom-and-bust cycles, felt virtually empty, a veritable ghost town notched high up in a secluded pocket of the Alps. History hadn’t been kind to the valley. First the Gotthard Tunnel rerouted the railway tourists who’d once stopped here during the belle epoque. Then the Swiss military, who’d made Andermatt a big base of operations, pulled out in the 1990s, leaving the resort a husk of its former self. All that remained was a picturesque main street flanked by timber chalets and old hotels and a few antiquated lifts ferrying skiers to the tops of the towering mountains that encircle the town. No-frills free riders came for the plentiful powder and off-piste faces lining the Gemsstock, the highest lift-serviced peak in the area, but they didn’t do much for the local economy when it came to spending money in town.
To Sawiris—whose holdings include El Gouna, an Egyptian resort town along the Red Sea with some 20,000 residents—the underdeveloped resort’s lack of infrastructure marked its appeal.
“Mr. Sawiris doesn’t only create tourism destinations, he creates towns,” says Stefan Kern, a spokesman for Andermatt Swiss Alps AG, the company Sawiris founded to transform Andermatt from a down-on-its-luck Alpine hamlet into a destination resort capable of rivaling Zermatt, St. Moritz, and Verbier.
In 2007, Sawiris proposed an audacious three-pronged resuscitation plan, one that would see more than $1 billion go toward an opulent luxury hotel and 18-hole Scottish-style golf course, a revamped and expanded ski area, and an ambitious development of holiday apartments and private chalets. To succeed at that third component—the one most critical to his bottom line—Sawiris had to find a way around a Swiss law that restricted foreigners from purchasing second homes. He did just that, getting the government to grant Andermatt an exemption as a special economic development zone. Once the town voted in favor of his plan, almost unanimously, Sawiris was off and running.
Spread out across nine peaked-roof chalets, the five-star 169-room Chedi opened its doors in 2013 and now forms the heart of the new Andermatt. The hotel has become a destination in and of itself for moneyed travelers—some skiers, some not—who want to unplug amid blissed-out luxury in the seclusion of the Swiss Alps. During a visit in early April, as the snow still dumped outside, an international array of guests milled about the sleek black-stone and timber lobby, ate farm-fresh breakfasts in the 250-person dining room beside an open kitchen, and floated downstairs to spa appointments. There’s a 6,000-bottle wine cellar, plus a Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant (a 10-course kaiseki menu is recommended) and, for those who can afford further seclusion, the two-floor Furka suite, which comes replete with a private spa and rents for $15,000 a night.
Still, despite its sheer size and over-the-top amenities, the Chedi doesn’t dominate Andermatt. Nor does Sawiris’s residential development on the north side of town, Andermatt Reuss, which is home to the recently opened four-star Radisson Blu hotel, a 650-seat classical music concert hall, and apartment buildings surrounding a central piazza. (Eighty percent of finished apartments have already been sold.) Instead, as you drive up the circuitous bends and through a crack in the mountains and into town, you’re greeted by the broad valley’s open snowfields, a few remaining military barracks, perhaps a red train trundling along on your right-hand side, and serrated peaks in every direction.
“Some people driving into the village don’t even realize the Chedi is there,” says Mari Russi, co-owner of Art 87 Andermatt, a contemporary gallery located just off the cobblestones of Gotthardstrasse. The hotel’s entrance “is very discreet. There’s no big sign—you really have to look for it.”
Russi hails from Sweden, but it was her Swiss husband, Bernhard Russi—Andermatt Swiss Alps board member and winner of the 1972 Olympic downhill—who introduced her to his hometown more than 30 years ago. A lot has changed since then, but like most locals she takes an all-ships-rise attitude toward Sawiris’s development. Now her clients are the type of people who won’t bat an eye at the $50,000 price tags of her gallery’s most expensive pieces.
“Everyone is happy the Chedi is here,” says Louie Gougouth, assistant manager at the Hotel Sonne, a 150-year-old family-owned institution that remains perhaps the most picturesque building in town. Originally from Morocco, Gougouth came to Switzerland to study at a hotel school, then wound up in Andermatt because of a job offer at a now-defunct hotel. He stayed because of the clean air, the unspoiled mountains, and the people who say “Uela!” to you—the local greeting—on the street every morning.
In April the atmospheric wood-paneled dining room at the 20-room Sonne was still busy, as it had been all season, with a mix of German and British families huddled around piping hot pots of fondue. “In the beginning it was just military,” Gougouth says, reflecting on his first years in Andermatt. “We were just seeing green, green, green, because of the uniforms. But now we see people from around the world. Even celebrities. Singers from the USA, golf players. This year we saw 50% growth over last year,” he says.
Making good on his plan to expand the ski area, Sawiris pumped $140 million into on-mountain infrastructure in only three years. Last season a gleaming eight-person gondola replaced a couple of old chairs; it now whisks skiers to the top of the Gütsch peak, from which they can ski a network of gentle and intermediate slopes before taking another new 10-person gondola into the neighboring resort of Sedrun, in the canton of Graubünden.
The most seasoned of skiers still lap off-piste runs from the Gemsstock’s cable car, but the multigenerational clans who now come to Andermatt make their migration east each morning toward Sedrun, skiing far above the tree line in the high alpine, partaking in that grand, stress-free European ski experience of lazily schussing from village to village.
All told, the interconnected ski area will boast 112 miles of slopes and 33 lifts. That’s two lifts more than Vail, Colo. A further lift connection will open during the 2019-20 winter season, allowing guests to ski all the way to the rolling, family-friendly slopes of Disentis.
Sawiris’s “if you build it, they will come” attitude appears to be working. Last season, Andermatt almost doubled its single-day skier record, attracting 12,000 guests. (Given the size of the expanded resort, that means the slopes were still relatively uncrowded.) But this growth isn’t necessarily what all locals want.
“The core atmosphere of the town is gone, it’s dead, it doesn’t exist anymore,” says Kevin Obschlager, who along with his wife owns the River House, a red-shingled boutique hotel and whiskey bar that opened more than a decade ago and catered to the hardcore skiers who flocked to Andermatt for its soulful atmosphere.
Obschlager likens Andermatt’s genesis—or perhaps downfall—to that of Telluride, which went from funky hippie hideaway to posh enclave, attracting Tom Cruise, Ralph Lauren, Oprah Winfrey, and other celebrities: “Now it’s luxury, luxury, luxury. Before, this place would be packed with smiling faces after powder days. People would come every weekend.” He shrugs. “Now people come once, and then they’re gone—they go to the Caribbean the next weekend.”
During the visit in April at least, Andermatt still felt undiscovered and refreshingly unpretentious. Snow fell at night, a ghostly mist hung among the narrow cobbled lanes cutting through town, and the few remaining military cadets filed into bars or shared cigarettes under the milky glow of streetlights. The slopes were equally uncrowded, and from the summit of the Gemsstock, with 3 feet of fresh snow blanketing the 5,000 feet of vertical leading to the valley, and the rugged mountains of Uri standing like sentinels keeping the rest of the world at bay, one thing was certain: The time to book your trip is most certainly now.

Some, like BP Plc CEO Bob Dudley and Tesco Plc CEO Dave Lewis, are handing over after years spent transforming their energy and retail empires to cope with the tectonic forces of environmental issues and online shopping. Others, like Alison Cooper at Imperial Brands, a tobacco company, are stepping down because they didn’t adapt to changing markets.
The players in a week of big changes:
The Record: Dudley will retire as CEO of BP early next year, a long-anticipated step after more than nine years running the energy giant. He took the helm during BP’s darkest period, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and is widely credited with rescuing the company from that disaster.
Investor View: BP shares have risen about 11% during his tenure, compared with a 27% return for the FTSE 100, and production is growing again.
Succession and Outlook: Dudley is succeeded by Bernard Looney, BP’s upstream chief, who faces an immediate challenge – whether to pivot the company toward cleaner, but typically less profitable forms of energy, or focus on fossil fuels even as demand growth slows.
The Record: Lewis was hailed as the man who fixed Tesco. He guided the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain back to health from a massive accounting scandal that came to light weeks after he took over in 2014. Lewis  streamlined Tesco, closing U.K. fresh-food counters and pulling back from international markets like South Korea and Turkey. His acquisition of wholesaler Booker has reduced the company’s exposure to the troubled British retail market as consumers shift spending online.
Investor View: Tesco shares have returned about 1.4% a year under Lewis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 5% average annual gain for the FTSE 100.
Succession and Outlook: Lewis is handing over to Ken Murphy of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., a surprise choice. When he takes over next year, Murphy will need to keep frisky discounters Aldi and Lidl at bay. Beyond that, he’ll need a strategy for the technological revolution that’s upending retail, including mining a trove of customer data to boost Tesco’s online business.
The Record: Cooper’s nine-year stint in charge of Imperial Brands Plc got off to a strong start but fizzled as the owner of Gauloise cigarettes and Blu vaping devices failed to keep up with bigger rivals and nimbler developers of smoking alternatives like Juul Labs Inc. Under Cooper, Imperial expanded its presence in the U.S. by acquiring the Winston and Kool brands. But the backlash against vaping prompted a profit warning, fueling investor unrest and hastening her departure.
Investor View: Imperial Brands shares have returned 4.9% a year under Cooper, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 7.1% average annual gain for the FTSE 100.
Succession and Outlook: An incoming CEO, yet to named, will have to navigate the storm over vaping while accelerating the company’s overhaul. Imperial Brands has been trying without success to sell its premium cigar business, and investors are calling for greater transparency over its finances.
The Record: Martin Gilbert is leaving as vice chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen Plc, the asset manager he helped found more than three decades ago. Gilbert lost his grip on power earlier this year when a dual CEO structure, in place since the company was created by a 2017 merger, was scrapped; Keith Skeoch became the sole chief executive.
Investor View: Standard Life Aberdeen  has plunged 29% since Aug. 8, 2017, the day the merged company’s shares began trading. This compares with a 3.1% gain in the FTSE 100 since that date. 
Succession and Outlook: Skeoch has a tough task. Big name active money managers are charging too much for mediocre returns, and many investors have shifted to passive funds that track benchmark stock and bond indexes and offer much lower fees. What started as a trickle has turned into a flood, forcing fees lower and triggering consolidation and job losses.
The Record: Hill’s role as chairman of Metro Bank Plc was under scrutiny since the start of the year, when the lender said it had incorrectly classified hundreds of millions of pounds of mortgages, failing to set aside enough capital to cover risks. That surprise led to questions about the 10-year-old bank’s viability, then to calls for Hill – Metro’s co-founder – to go.
Investor View:  Metro Bank was a star performer, touching a high of a little over 40 pounds ($49.39) last year, easily outperforming the U.K.’s blue chip stock index. By the beginning of 2019 they had halved, and since the loan misclassification announcement the stock has lost about 90% of its value.
Succession and Outlook: The bank is looking for a sucessor to Hill. Metro’s attraction was its growth strategy, and getting this back on track will be his or her priority. Speculation has mounted in recent weeks that the bank may not be able to outrun its problems and might be sold. Metro has said so far that it’s considering asset sales to repair its finances.

The companies are already under intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who has said he wants to ban all flavored devices; the Food and Drug Administration; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and two House committees. In addition, Massachusetts, San Francisco, Michigan, and New York are moving to ban sales, and multiple state attorneys general are investigating whether Juul violated consumer protection laws by marketing to people under age 18.

Alison Cooper took tobacco out of Imperial Brands’s name, but couldn’t shift its dependence away from traditional cigarettes fast enough. Her successor will have to.
Imperial’s next CEO will need to see through the smoke.
Imperial Brands Plc’s Alison Cooper is stepping down in a cloud of raspberry scented smoke.
The timing isn’t surprising. It comes exactly a week after the British-based maker of Davidoff cigarettes and the Blu electronic device,  lowered expectations for sales and profits after taking a hit in the U.S. vaping market. The warning brought to a head discussions about the company’s future leadership as the board conducts its search for a successor to Chairman Mark Williamson.Change is clearly needed. The shares of the smallest of the world’s major tobacco companies are roughly back where they were at the start of Cooper’s 9-year watch, having lost more than half of their value since a 2016 peak.Her successor faces a tall order. The new CEO will have to figure out how to make Imperial a strong force in tobacco alternatives. It currently ranks fourth in electronic smoking devices by units sold on a four-week basis. But in the heat-not-burn segment, its Pulze product is a relative newcomer in the Japanese market, where the products have taken hold more quickly than elsewhere. It’s important to have a clear strategy in each segment since no one really knows exactly where the market’s headed.Finding the right path forward won’t be easy, given the crisis engulfing vaping in the U.S., which has prompted efforts by President Donald Trump to ban flavored products and nicotine pads while some retailers including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes.

They must find a way through this. One option would be developing a boarder suite of tobacco alternatives alongside Imperial’s Blu vaping device. Stepping up development in heat-not-burn segment would also be wise.
Rival British American Tobacco Plc has hedged its bets, with a presence in both vaping and the heat-not-burn segment. This is a model that Imperial should follow. But this would likely mean more investment.
Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, says Imperial can afford to spend more. First of all, it’s core business of traditional cigarettes ­ — including local brands such as Winston in the U.S. — is cash generative. Plus, its 2 billion-pound ($2.5 billion) asset disposal program and decision to abandon its policy to increase its dividend by 10% annually should give it scope to act.
The new chairman must also address corporate governance issues. Bloomberg News reported that investors and analysts had voiced concerns about Imperial’s earnings calculations and strategy.

Imperial has long been seen as a takeover target, but it is now particularly vulnerable given the share price weakness and that industry consolidation is back on the agenda, even after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks.
Japan Tobacco Inc. is often mooted as the likely predator, although it would have to find a way to deal with competition constraints.
If the new chairman and chief executive don’t raise their game on alternatives, then someone else might light up even more radical change for them.

Imperial Brands Plc said Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper is stepping down from the U.K. tobacco company, a week after it warned that sales of cigarette alternatives are falling short of expectations.
The maker of Blu vaping devices said Cooper, who has been in the top job for nine years, will leave once a successor is found. She is the second CEO to announce a departure from a blue-chip British company in two days, after Tesco Plc’s Dave Lewis on Wednesday.
Imperial shares rose as much as 2.4% early Thursday in London.
The company said last week that earnings growth ground to a halt in the latest 12 months after a drastic slowdown in revenue from smoking alternatives and weak cigarette sales. That came after the outbreak of a mystery illnesses linked to vaping led to a U.S. crackdown on the practice.
Under Cooper, 53, Imperial has struggled to keep up with bigger rivals like British American Tobacco Plc in the world of e-cigarettes and devices that heat tobacco rather than burning it. Upstart Juul Labs Inc., at the center of the storm over vaping in the U.S., also stole a march on the established players.
Imperial, the smallest of the major international tobacco companies, has yet to find a buyer for its premium cigar business, after it announced plans for a sale earlier this year.
The shares have fallen more than 20% this year. After a runup that ended in 2016, they’re roughly back to the level when Cooper took over in 2010. Her departure continues a leadership overhaul that began earlier this year when Imperial said it was seeking a successor to Chairman Mark Williamson.
Cooper’s move follows Bloomberg’s story on a confidential report by financial communications adviser Tulchan, arguing for more financial transparency at the company, after investors and analysts voiced concerns over its accounting.
In June, Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg slammed Imperial’s earnings calculations, saying the company includes non-operational factors such as gains from asset sales and uses that definition of profit as a factor in setting executive bonuses.
“It’s time for a clean sheet and a new management team,” said Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment Management.
Investors have also expressed concern with Imperial’s commitment to smaller, local brands at a time when smoking is in decline. While she has streamlined the portfolio in some areas, the company four years ago expanded its U.S. operations with the acquisition of Winston, Kool, Salem and Maverick cigarettes. 
“Alison has driven a sharper focus on Imperial’s strongest brands and markets, halving the number of cigarette brands to ensure a higher quality of growth,” Williamson said in a statement."

As the Food and Drug Administration’s plan to restrict the e-cigarette industry takes shape, driven by a spate of vaping-related illnesses, cigarette sales aren’t yet reflecting smokers’ concerns that vapes might not be the safer alternative to traditional smoking that marketing campaigns were built around.
Sales trends for the past month, including the period since the FDA’s Sept. 11 announcement that it would pursue a ban on flavored vapes, suggest that the combustible cigarette market has yet to see a boost in demand following the Centers for Disease Control’s public health warnings about vaping. Sales of e-cigarettes have slowed, meanwhile, as regulators weigh their options to regulate the nascent phenomenon.
Fitch Ratings said in a report Thursday that it expects “significantly slower growth” in vaping in the short term given tighter regulations. In the long term, Fitch said tougher rules could benefit larger tobacco manufacturers, as consumers pivot to “closed systems” that are generally viewed as safer products.
Recent IRI data show that cigarette volume declines for the four-week period ending Sept. 22 stayed “roughly unchanged” from the prior four weeks, at down 7.7%. Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery said he was “surprised that cigarette volume trends did not yet show a more obvious benefit from sequential vapor declines”.
Similarly, Wells Fargo says the latest Nielsen data suggests cigarette industry volume declines moderated only slightly, to down 6.7% in the four weeks ended Sept. 21, against a 12-week contraction of 7%. Analyst Bonnie Herzog continues to believe that more bad news for e-cigarettes, as well as an FDA ban, could still result in improved cigarette volumes, as vapers potentially return to cigarette smoking -- which is “not the FDA’s desired outcome.”
Growth in tobacco alternatives “may be deferred a little,” says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Duncan Fox, adding that several more months of weakness need to be seen “before a panic from tobacco companies.”
As several states move to ban flavored vapes that appeal to teenagers, traditional cigarettes are likely to benefit, but “the growth will not be linear,” Fox says. New devices are likely to spur growth in the industry, and the market for heat-not-burn, vapor and cannabis, will probably remain “the growth engine for a heavily regulated industry for some time.”
For now, e-cigarette sales are already slowing, and Juul, in particular, is suffering from a crackdown after the FDA accused it of illegally marketing e-cigarettes as less harmful than traditional cigarettes. IRI data show an 11% decline in e-cigarette sales in the four-week period ending Sept. 22, while Nielsen suggested e-cigarette sales volumes rose about 38% in the latest 12 weeks, slowing from growth of 48% in the prior period.

The decline was led by Juul, which most “feels the pressure” from the recent crackdown together with increased competition, said Wells Fargo’s Herzog. Juul’s dollar share, which declined sequentially, has been picked up by competing e-cigarette companies Blu, NJOY, Vuse and Logic, she said.
But there are still a lot of unknowns, analysts say. “The numbers have fallen as retailers have stopped selling,” said BI’s Fox. “Whether that is what is actually happening, though, is tough to know,” since sales over the internet or at small shops, for instance, may not be reflected in the data.
“Stronger regulation is needed, fast,” Fox said. “I can see why the FDA is taking some time to get it right. Get it wrong and they may make things worse.”"

Sony’s PlayStation Now subscriptions number less than 1% of all PS4s sold. Above: Milan Games Week.
Sony Corp. has halved the price of its PlayStation Now subscription games service. Competition from console rival Nintendo Co. as well as new offerings from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc. are the obvious reasons.
In addition, though, PlayStation Now failed to live up to its potential. At $19.99 per month,
            

                1
            
        the product was way overpriced. After four years, Sony has just 700,000 paid subscribers. That’s less than 1% of the 96.8 million PlayStation 4 units the company sold by the end of March.
As Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft Corp. enjoy loyalty and ongoing revenue streams from subscribing services for games, both Apple and Google enjoy a clear advantage in something far more valuable: attention.
What these companies are really competing for isn’t share of the games market but consumer time. A minute watching Netflix or swiping Tinder is a minute not spent playing GTA or Super Mario Kart. 
In that respect, Google and Apple are both able to grab user attention multiple times per day thanks to their iOS and Android smartphones. Even Nintendo’s handheld Switch can’t compete.
Sony has the potential to push growth even faster in its games network as it fends off subscription rivals
Source: Sony

Complicating the matter for Now is Sony’s own rival offering,: PlayStation Plus, which goes for $9.99 per month. Now is a streaming service like those provided by Netflix Inc. or Spotify Technology SA, while Plus is more of a community that allows online multiplayer games, offers just two free PS4 titles per month, and provides some other benefits.
By cutting Now to $9.99 per month, Sony’s gross margins and average selling price on that service will suffer. Yet the unit economics mean that longer-term revenue and operating profit in this division can expand. By my reckoning, Sony should be able to hit 1.5 million paid Now members by the end of September 2020; if not, then I would consider PlayStation Now a failed product that needs to be reassessed.
As proof, we can look at Plus. It offers a lesser games catalog than Now, albeit with other compelling features, but had 36.4 million subscribers at the end of March – that’s 50 times more than Now. Price is a major factor in users’ purchase of a subscription, according to Nielsen Co.’s Superdata. So with that hurdle lowered, Now ought to be attractive enough to get the same level of attention.
Yet if loyal consumers want both access to the deepest catalog of games, and interactive features and other benefits, they shouldn’t be forced to shell out twice. Instead of milking customers, Sony would be better served by either folding Now and Plus into one service or offering a steep discount to have both.
This isn’t just out of fairness to customers, but a matter of survival.  Nintendo’s Switch Online is just $3.99 while Microsoft has Xbox Game Pass at $9.99. Apple’s Arcade is $4.99, and Google’s Stadia costs $9.99. By asking for double its nearest rival, Sony is throwing away the advantage it enjoys by having a superior product for the sake of a few dollars more. That’s reminiscent of its failures with Memory Stick storage cards and BluRay DVDs, mistakes it ought not to repeat.
Sony cut the price of its Now games service from $19.99 to be more in line with rivals

Note: This is a selection of offerings, services may not be equivalent. Discounts may be offered for longer subscriptions.
With five big names now offering games subscriptions, it’s clear that the business model is evolving beyond single-unit sales. By selling all-you-can-eat packages, Netflix and Spotify schooled Apple at a time when the iPhone maker was still charging per song and per movie.
Sony can also learn from Netflix and Home Box Office Inc. that offering competitive set-price packages doesn’t mean you need to forgo blockbuster titles. In fact, Sony’s access to the highest-quality games is the moat that rivals will struggle to cross.
The move toward games subscriptions will be good for the entire industry by bringing in more total revenue. That also makes it Sony’s battle to lose.

The year keeps getting worse for Imperial Brands Plc shares, 2019’s biggest decliner among European personal and household-goods stocks, as a backlash against smoking alternatives batters the tobacco industry.
The stock suffered a blow on Thursday after the company revised down its full-year revenue forecast and earnings expectations, citing a deterioration in the U.S. vaping market. That follows underwhelming results in May, when first-half sales for next-generation products missed analysts’ expectations.
Imperial Brands shares have lost about a third of their value since reaching a 12-month high in November, a few days after the U.K. maker of Blu vaping devices announced additional investment in its next-generation products, which have been touted as a future driver of growth.
“The category remains unprofitable but management expect it to reach breakeven in 2020, which we believe is unlikely,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Sanath Sudarsan wrote in a note. “Imperial provided little comfort on the underlying business model.”

The warning from the maker of Blu vaping devices adds to the fallout from a backlash against e-cigarettes that has already scuttled the biggest potential merger in the industry. Imperial’s shares plunged 13% on Thursday, wiping out more than $3 billion of market value. 
“It calls Imperial Brands’ and the tobacco industry’s longer-term business model into question,” said James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC. “The implications should not be under-estimated.”
Early Signs of Vaping Health Risks Were Missed or Ignored
Imperial’s warning comes a day after Altria Group Inc. abandoned talks on a possible merger with Philip Morris International Inc. and installed one of its own executives at the helm of embattled e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. U.S. health officials are scrambling to identify a mystery illness linked to vaping, denting prospects for what had become one of the biggest new growth markets in the industry. Consumers are now questioning the devices, touted to carry fewer health risks than traditional cigarettes.
Imperial Brands, the smallest of the major tobacco companies, has lost more than half its market value from a 2016 peak. With a tighter research budget than rivals, the company has struggled to keep up with devices such as Juul and Philip Morris’s IQOS, which heats tobacco without burning it. After years of shrugging off that market in favor of vaping products, Imperial recently introduced its first heated-tobacco device in Japan.
Imperial’s smoking-alternative business remains unprofitable but will move toward breaking even through 2020, Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper said on a call with investors. The U.K.-based company, which sells Winston cigarettes in the U.S., said earnings per share were roughly flat at constant currencies and sales rose about 2% in the 12 months through September.
“It will be bumpy over the coming months, and there may be some short-term pain,” Cooper said. Regulation will weed out the industry, leaving a few responsible companies, she added. “Therefore there will be a much better competitive environment.”
The Trump administration said earlier this month that it would soon remove all flavored e-cigarette nicotine pods from the market, and only allow them back in stores after they gained approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Several U.S. states have moved to restrict vaping, and Walmart Inc. has decided to stop selling e-cigarettes in its home market.
The entire industry has been shuddering, not just the small independent vape companies that may have a harder time dealing with stricter policies from the FDA. In the past month, British American Tobacco Plc said that it plans to cut 2,300 jobs and Japan Tobacco Inc. announced it will eliminate 3,720 positions.
BAT shares fell as much as 4.8% Thursday.
Imperial’s sales of smoking alternatives rose about 50% this fiscal year, slowing from the breakneck 200% pace of the first half. The company also cited a tougher market for tobacco in countries such as Australia.
Several potential buyers have expressed interest in its premium cigar business, Imperial also said. The company has put the unit up for sale as part of a plan to raise as much as 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) from asset disposals.

Imperial Brands, maker of Winstons and Blu e-cigarettes, has cut its profit guidance. Things are looking pretty bleak for Big Tobacco.
Feeling Blu.
The crisis engulfing the American vaping industry has claimed its first European victim. Imperial Brands Plc, the British-based maker of Winston cigarettes in the U.S. and the Blu electronic device, cut its sales and profit guidance on Thursday, a day after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks amid increasing Washington scrutiny of illnesses associated with the smoking alternative.
Imperial in part blamed a slowdown in U.S. demand for electronic cigarettes for its expectation of flat earnings in the year to Sept. 30. It had anticipated expansion of between 4% and 8%. Revenue will expand by 2%, at the low end of its 1% to 4% range. The shares fell as much as 11%.
Some American retailers, including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes, while President Donald Trump is moving to ban flavored products and nicotine pods. All of this came together to weigh on Imperial’s sales in the final quarter, when it was also running a big marketing campaign for its Blu device.
So far the problems haven’t spread to Europe or Japan (the most developed market for devices that heat rather than burn tobacco). Imperial expects sales of its new generation products to increase by 50% this year. That may look eye-watering but it’s below previous expectations.

This is a worry for all of Big Tobacco, which is investing billions of pounds in innovative new products. Philip Morris has developed the iQos “heat not burn” device, while British American Tobacco Plc has a suite of alternatives.
The idea is that manufacturers use the cash flows from their traditional cigarettes business to develop products they describe as lower risk. As smoking rates decline, these devices are meant to pick up the slack among consumers. The transition hasn’t been smooth. Growth slowed in Japan last year, where older people proved more reluctant to follow tech-savvy early adopters of alternatives.
The scrutiny in the U.S. is clearly a serious problem for this potentially huge, but nascent market. Yet there’s an irony too: The crackdown on vaping might drive some of the adults who’ve switched to vapes back to cigarettes.
While tobacco alternatives have huge potential, cigarettes are still the main driver of the industry

Note: Tobacco alternatives include smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes and devices that heat, rather than burn tobacco.
Although gross profit margins on alternatives are approaching those of cigarettes, according to Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the traditional product remains the driver of profit and cash flow for the industry. A slower decline in the numbers of traditional tobacco smokers would be terrible for public health, but it might end up easing some of the financial pressure on Big Tobacco, at least in the short term. While the industry has always been a big dividend payer, there have been increasing doubts about whether this is sustainable.
Tobacco stocks have underperformed the market this year

Note: Normalized as of 12/31/2018
Greater regulation of alternatives could also play to the big companies’ advantage. Most — though not all — of the individuals who’ve fallen ill used black-market vaping pods. A tightening of the rules could favor the devices made by large manufacturers, which have decades of experience lobbying lawmakers. These companies have deep pockets for research and development too.
Nevertheless, unless the industry can develop alternatives that are genuinely less harmful, the outlook for what was Big Tobacco’s last great hope looks bleak. Expect more vaping dreams to go up in smoke.

It’s the prevailing view across Europe, where authorities are more sanguine because the ailments popping up in the U.S. have largely been linked to vaping liquids laced with THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, which is off-limits in much of Europe. Use among European teenagers is also much lower than in the U.S., as is the nicotine content in popular vaping products.
“If you’re a smoker and you have not stopped smoking, try vaping,” Martin Dockrell, head of tobacco issues at Public Health England, said in an interview posted on his Twitter feed this month. The government agency has repeatedly said vaping is 95% less harmful than cigarettes.

The response to the vaping crisis underlines a deeper difference in the two regions’ approach to smoking alternatives. U.K. health bodies are leading a push for acceptance of products such as Imperial Brands Plc’s Blu and British American Tobacco Plc’s Vype as a way to get people to quit smoking, which is linked to cancer, heart disease and other ailments. Conversely in the U.S., which has seen countless tobacco lawsuits over the past decades, cigarette alternatives are feared to be a possible gateway into smoking.
What aligns both regions is that smoking rates have fallen, while vaping numbers have climbed. In the U.S., about 13% of the population smoked cigarettes last year, down from some 18% in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. In the U.K., the rate has come down to 14% from 19%, while declines have been slower in countries like France and Germany.
The U.K. is Europe’s No. 1 vaping market, with 6.3% of the adult population using such devices, but far fewer British teenagers vape than their counterparts in the U.S. About 1.6% of 11- to 18-year-olds said they used e-cigarettes more than once a week, according to a Yougov survey published by anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and Health in June. The Health & Human Services Department said Wednesday that the proportion of regular vapers among U.S. high school students has risen to one in four, citing preliminary data from a new survey.
Vaping Was Called Safer Than Smoking. What Happened?: QuickTake
U.K. authorities said they received seven reports in 2019 of adverse reactions suspected to have been caused by vaping, with no fatalities. Meanwhile, there have been 380 U.S. reports in recent months about the mysterious symptoms linked to the practice, including six deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Vaping liquids that contain THC are hard to find in Europe, which may explain why the EU hasn’t seen similar health scares as in the U.S. State health officials in New York have pointed to vitamin E acetate as a likely culprit for the respiratory symptoms, as the substance has been found in some products used to inhale THC.

Europe’s effort to push cigarette smokers toward vaping and heated tobacco devices is rooted in a public health approach called harm reduction that gained acceptance in the 1980s for prevention of HIV and other diseases among sex workers and injecting drug users. The approach seeks to diminish the impact of risky behaviors by promoting infection-blocking tools like clean needles and condoms. The strategy contrasted with efforts like the “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign championed by Nancy Reagan.
“We are clear vaping is not without risks, but compared with smoking tobacco it is far less harmful,” said Rosanna O’Connor, director of alcohol, drugs and tobacco at Public Health England.
European authorities have combined their embrace of e-cigarettes with tougher regulations -- restricting marketing to children, for example, and imposing lower limits on nicotine content -- that have made the new devices more acceptable to health officials. The U.K. prohibits vaping companies from targeting teens. Real or fictitious characters that could appeal to youths are banned, as are depictions of e-cigarette users who appear to be under 25.
The European Union also has lower limits on nicotine levels in e-cigarette fluid, permitting a maximum of 20 milligrams per milliliter, compared with 59 milligrams per milliliter in Juul Labs Inc.’s vape hits. In order to enter EU markets such as the U.K., the U.S. company has had to dilute its nicotine liquids there.
London-based BAT, which on Thursday announced 2,300 job cuts as it repositions itself to focus on smoking substitutes, says it shares the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s concerns that marketing of some flavored vaping products could appeal to children.
“At the same time, it is hard to overestimate the role that the responsible marketing of flavors plays in helping adult consumers move on from combustible products to alternative tobacco and nicotine products,” BAT said in a statement.
Juul recently opened shops on Chinese e-commerce sites Tmall and JD.com as it seeks to expand worldwide.
Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, has campaigned and given money in support of a ban on flavored e-cigarettes and tobacco and supports efforts to reduce global demand for tobacco worldwide.
Some European countries have highlighted risks of e-cigarettes, including addiction and the possibility that they could encourage users to take up smoking. An August report sponsored by the German health ministry concluded that while they may help smokers quit, they should be regulated more strongly to reduce the public’s use of the products and prevent cardiovascular risks.
Still, Europe’s approach has been less adversarial, according to Jonathan Fell, principal at London-based investment manager Ash Park, which owns shares in Philip Morris, BAT and Altria.
“In the U.S. there’s still this mindset that what is the enemy is the tobacco industry, not the harms from smoking,” he said.

After the quietest month in more than six years, initial public offerings are finally picking up in Hong Kong.
Just one company went public in the Asian financial hub in August, Hands Form Holdings Ltd., in a tiny HK$130 million ($17 million) IPO. The last time only one company listed in a whole month was in April 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
While it’s not unusual for the summer months to be quiet with many bankers and investors on vacation, this month’s activity has been particularly sedate as the city’s ongoing protests and an escalating trade war between China and the U.S. dented investor sentiment.
Activity is now gathering pace, with one company, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc., on the road gauging investor demand for an initial share sale that could raise at least $600 million, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Czech consumer finance company Home Credit BV had a hearing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing committee on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said, meaning it could also start assessing investor demand soon.
And Bank of Guizhou plans to start pre-marketing a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1 billion as early as next week, IFR Asia reported, citing unidentified people close to the deal.
Hong Kong badly needs more deals. With only $10.8 billion raised through IPOs so far, it ranks fourth among global exchanges, behind rival New York. This time last year companies had raised $24.3 billion in Hong Kong IPOs, though admittedly 2018 was a blockbuster year.
Elsewhere, things are also getting busy in Southeast Asia. The property arm of Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi is weighing investor demand for an IPO of its property arm, Asset World Corp., people familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile Australia’s Lendlease Group plans to start pre-marketing a real estate investment trust IPO in Singapore of up to S$750m next week, IFR Asia reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the transaction.

The talks will build on the momentum from the G-7, which was attended by Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, the U.K. said. Britain will also raise concerns about tensions in Hong Kong.
The U.S. should find a way to   reverse the decline in demand at Treasury auctions before issuing super-long maturities that investors don't even want, Robert Burgess writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Investors submitted bids for seven-year notes that had the lowest bid-to-cover ratio since 2009. The government may end up spending more in interest on its existing lineup than it would save on a 50- or 100-year bond.
A trade truce could negatively impact Southeast Asian nations that have attracted investment otherwise destined for China, Daniel Moss writes in Bloomberg Opinion.

Deliberations are at an early stage, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Blued didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

India’s Energy Efficiency Services Ltd., responsible for replacing the state’s vehicles with new-energy cars, is seeking to lease electric vehicles to cab companies amid delays integrating them into government fleets.
EESL has made offers to lease EVs to Ola Cabs, a Softbank Group Corp.-backed ride-hailing service, and Indian taxi firm Meru Cabs, and plans to reach out as well to Uber Technologies Inc., according to Managing Director Saurabh Kumar. EESL already signed an agreement earlier this month with electric taxi startup Blu-Smart Mobility for 500 electric cars, he said.
The taxi companies would also be able to use the agency’s charging network. It’s planning to set up 100 charging stations each in 10 cities by March, Kumar said in an interview.
EESL awarded its first tender in September 2017 for 10,000 cars to electrify the government’s fossil-fuel driven fleet. However, only 1,000 cars are on the roads as the state procurement process has been slow. That tender had been awarded to automakers Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.
“We haven’t met the expectations we had earlier, but from an ecosystem perspective this tender triggered building of infrastructure,” Kumar said. “I am more than satisfied with it.”"

Time To Move, the Swatch Group press event held May 14 to 16 in Switzerland, was something of an experiment. When the group decided to pull out of this year's Baselworld, it had to make other arrangements for 17 of its brands to show their new watches to clients and the press. 
Management decided that the group's six most expensive brands would meet commercial clients during Baselworld at the headquarters of the Hayek Group in downtown Zürich. (The Hayek Group is a private consulting company owned by the Hayek family, the Swatch Group's largest shareholder.) The other brands would meet with clients in local markets. 
As for the press, the six prestige brands decided to invite 200 journalists to Switzerland in May for meetings at the brand's production facilities. ""We are trying to change the concept,"" Blancpain CEO Marc Hayek, said. ""We want to present the novelties in the place where they are created and born."" The goal was to show not just watches the brands make, but where and how they make them. 
So it was that for three days, 200 reporters from 21 countries, separated into small groups by language, traveled around Switzerland's watchmaking region in vans, visiting six brands in six towns. 
Among them were our own Stephen Pulvirent and myself. Stephen reported on the new products; I focused on the factory visits. There we got a crash course on the Swiss system of mechanical watchmaking, essentially a T Tour (T for Terminaison, French for ""finishing""). That's trade terminology for the five stages of watch production, from T0 (the making of movement parts) to T4 (packing and shipping). 
What follows are one reporter's notes on the Swatch Group's whirlwind watch manufacture tour. 
On Day 1, bright and early, our group of 14 reporters from the U.S. and Australia piled into a van for the trip from our hotel in Lausanne up to Switzerland's legendary Vallée de Joux. The valley is nestled in the Jura Mountains that form the western border of Switzerland and France. The hour-long ride takes us up steep winding roads to the Col du Mollendruz, 3,871 feet above sea level, one of two mountain passes that lead to the Vallée below. First stop is the village of Le Sentier, home to the Blancpain manufacture. 
More than 700 people work here, in every phase of watchmaking, from watch and caliber design to movement manufacturing, casing, testing, and after-sales service. (Blancpain sells 30,000 watches a year, we are told.)
Today we'll get a glimpse of movement manufacturing. Our hosts issue us white lab coats, embossed with our names, and off we go. In the basement is the first stage of watch production, T0: the production of movement components, first by machine, then by hand. We're led into a storage room holding the raw materials – brass sheets and steel bars. From the next room comes a loud, rhythmic pounding sound. That's the Atelier Decoupage. We enter and see Essa machines pounding out brass mainplates, 100 pieces per minute. 
We move to the toolmaking workshop. There is a separate tool to cut each component in a watch movement, we are told. ""If there are 300 components in a movement, you need 300 tools,"" our guide says. Blancpain makes almost all its cutting tools itself. 
We move to the Usinage (Machining) section, containing a series of MTR 312 cutting machines that resemble NASA lunar modules. In the machines are 18 to 36 spindles programmed to mill, tap and drill brass components with a precision of 1 to 2 microns. 
Then to Tournage (Turning), a workshop that fabricates gold oscillating weights for self-winding movements. All Blancpain rotors are made of gold, except one: Ladybird watches have platinum rotors, also made here. Next is the Ebauches section, where machines make plates, bridges, springs, levers and other steel components.
In the next workshop, Lavage (Washing), every component is cleaned ultrasonically in hot baths containing natural detergents. Finally, each component goes to a decoration workshop, elsewhere in the Vallée de Joux, where it is decorated and washed again. That completes T0.   
The components then go upstairs to T1, and so do we. T1 is the stage where the components are assembled by watchmakers into complete movements. For these workshops, we must put blue plastic booties over our shoes so that we don't track dirt or dust into the ateliers. 
Here men and women wearing white lab coats, with loupes fixed by a wire around their heads, do pre-assembly of the mainplate, bridges and crown. They use electronic screwdrivers that exert exact pressure on the screws, and eight different oils for lubrication. Then, by hand, they assemble barrels, fix pallets and silicon hairsprings to escapements, and perform all the operations to create complete calibers. 
Every complete movement is tested and adjusted here and then sent to T2, watch assembly, done elsewhere in this building. We, however, head to Blancpain's high complication workshops in the nearby village of Le Brassus. There to greet us, wearing a white lab coat, is Blancpain CEO Marc Hayek.  
""The Farm,"" as Blancpain calls the factory, is a series of small ateliers in what was originally a mill located next to a stream on a hill above Le Brassus. Here master watchmakers make Blancpain's highest complications: minute repeaters, split-second chronographs, tourbillons, carrousels, and complex calendars. Outside one atelier is an amazing display that dramatizes what goes on here: it shows each one of the 740 parts in Blancpain's 1735 Grande Complication watch of 1991, at the time the most complicated automatic wristwatch ever made. 
Here, too, are ateliers devoted to decorating and engraving movement components and dials. We move from atelier to atelier, for the new product presentations by Blancpain executives, including Hayek himself, who presents the new Fifty Fathom watches.
 
In the afternoon, we ride down the road to Manufacture Breguet, in L'Orient, the village next to Le Brassus. We are welcomed by Thierry Esslinger, CEO of Montres Breguet, and Emmanuel Breguet, vice president/head of patrimony & marketing. They pay tribute to two extraordinary watch entrepreneurs. 
Emmanuel Breguet (right), head of patrimony and marketing at Montres Breguet,  showing the author the new Classique Tourbillon Extra-Plat Squelette watch.
This first is Emmanuel Breguet's ancestor, Neuchâtel-born Abraham-Louis Breguet, the genius Swiss watchmaker (and inventor of the tourbillon, patented in 1801) who opened a watch shop in Paris in 1775. The other is Nicolas G. Hayek, Sr., the Swatch Group chairman whose acquisition of the Breguet firm in 1999 revived the company, and who served as its CEO until his death in 2010. 
As we soon see, the spirit of both men inhabits this place.  Our first stop is the Restoration Department. ""This is where Abraham-Louis's DNA lies,"" our guide says. In this atelier, master watchmakers restore Breguet watches going back to the founder's time. We see one watchmaker working on a movement from 1810. Each year, about 20 vintage Breguets are restored here.
We're also shown the Breguet No. 1160 watch, an exact replica of Breguet's celebrated No. 160, the ""Marie Antoinette"" watch, which stood for a century as the world's most complicated watch. It was stolen from a Jerusalem museum in 1983 and later recovered. While it was still missing, Hayek Sr. decided to recreate it. ""It was a challenge that Nicolas Hayek wanted his house, his baby, to take on,"" our guide tell us. It was unveiled in 2008. 
The restoration department is in a landmark building that was for a century the Lemania factory. Nouvelle Lemania, as it became known, was part of the Breguet Group when the Swatch Group acquired it. It made movements for Breguet and third-party clients, most famously for Omega's Speedmaster. Hayek Sr. restored the Nouvelle Lemania building. Then, in 2001, he expanded and upgraded the facility in the first of three major expansions, changing the name to Manufacture Breguet in 2004. 
We leave the original Lemania building along a corridor leading to the modern three-story extension. On the way, we come upon a marker set into the floor, engraved as follows:  LA 1ere PIERRE A ETE POSEE / LE 28 09 2001 / PAR Monsieur NICOLAS G. HAYEK & SON FILS NICK (""The first cornerstone was laid on Sept. 28, 2001 by Mr. Nicolas G. Hayek and his son Nick."") Buried under the cornerstone is a time capsule containing a VHS video cassette with a message from Hayek to the future. And a video cassette player to play it on, in the event there aren't any around in the future! There are also newspapers from that time, with articles about Hayek's revival of the Breguet company.
Breguet employs 800 people in the Vallée de Joux, most of them here. We quickly pass by the T0 machine-manufacturing operations on the ground floor. T0 continues on the top floor, with components hand-finished by artisans. 
To me, the most striking section was Guillochage, where literally dozens of artisans sit operating engine-turning machines. Also called rose engines, the machines engrave dials with intricate patterns of intersecting lines. Abraham-Louis loved the look of guilloché, and employed it extensively on his thin-cased pocket watches that revolutionized watch design. He was the first to use guilloché on dials, we learn, and liked the way diamond-shaped patterns reflected light. At Manufacture Breguet, there are 35 rose engine machines. 
T2, assembly of the watch (fitting of the dial and hands; casing; complications assembly) takes place on level 1, the middle floor. Since Breguet was the inventor of the tourbillon, we get a short class on tourbillons, and learn that the company has six different types of tourbillon cages. 
 
The next morning, we head north from Lausanne, past large Lake Neuchatel and smaller Lake Bienne, into the town of Biel/Bienne (the German and French versions of the town's name; it has been officially known by both since 2005) to Omega's brand-new factory, which opened in 2017. There, CEO Reynald Aeschlimann, in his opening remarks, says that this is ""a great time for Omega."" 
The new, state-of-the-art factory, opened in 2017, is a symbol of a resurgent Omega. It is Switzerland's clear number two watch company, in terms of annual revenue (after Rolex), with sales estimated by Ventobel Equity Research at $2.26 billion wholesale for 2018. Two big anniversaries this year are sure to boost those sales: the 125th anniversary of the creation of the Omega brand and the  50th anniversary of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, when Omega became the first watch worn on the moon. 
There has been an Omega factory on this spot for 137 years, and Aeschlimann is proud to show off the gee-whiz wonders of the new plant. The five-story building was designed by Pritzker-prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban, built with concrete, glass and Swiss spruce.
Here we see industrial, not artisanal, production. Omega produces 3,000 watches a day, Aeschlimann tells us. Which means Omega produces in two weeks  what Blancpain does in a year. All of Omega's manufacturing is now under one roof: T2 (assembling the watch head and casing), T3 (bracelet assembly), and T4 (packaging and shipping). (Movement making, T1, is done elsewhere at ETA factories.) Also here is Omega's METAS testing center for Master Chronometer certification.
A highlight of the factory is its fully automated storage system, which delivers components to the workshops without human intervention. Located in a three-story, fireproof, 3,660 cubic foot space in the center of the building, the storage area holds more than 30,000 boxes containing all the parts necessary for T2 and T3. 
A system of four robotic arms -- our guide, Mariano Samudio, calls them John, Paul, George, and Ringo – and two vertical lifts, moving at breath-taking speed (4 meters per second) fetch the boxes and deliver them along 500 meters of conveyors. They perform 1,400 operations per hour, which visitors can observe through windows on the ground floor, or from above, through a window in the floor on level 4.
Once the components get to the workshops, however, the watch head is created the old-fashioned way, by hand. Ninety percent of the work of casing the movement, placing the dial, setting the hands, adjusting the stem, and so on, is done by hand. 
Unlike in the Vallée de Joux ateliers, we don't go into Omega's workshop, but view what goes on through glass dividers. To keep dust out, Omega does not allow any paper – or visitors – in the workshops. All communication there is done via touch-screen tablets. 
 
After lunch, we ride back up into the Jura Mountains, to La Chaux-de-Fonds, the self-described ""metropole horlogère"" (watchmaking metropolis), population 40,000, that has been a watchmaking town for 300 years. We drive along Rue Louis-Joseph Chevrolet. (Yep, that Chevrolet: the car pioneer was born here. So was renowned architect Le Corbusier.) We turn onto Allée du Tourbillon and arrive at Montres Jaquet Droz. 
Jaquet Droz, which the Swatch Group acquired the year after Montres Breguet, is named for a local watchmaking wizard. Pierre Jaquet-Droz was born La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1721. His genius was to create not only watches and clocks, but automata that helped promote his timepieces. 
His automata were considered wonders of the world. Three androids – the Writer, the Draughtsman, and the Musician – brought him international fame. Finished in 1774, and presented for the first time in La Chaux-de-Fonds, they caused a sensation. They ""performed"" for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in Paris in 1775, followed by a tour of various Royal Courts around Europe. Today, they are in the permanent collection of the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire in Neuchâtel, and are still working (the Museum demonstrates them to the public regularly).
Montres Jaquet Droz continues Pierre Jaquet-Droz's legacy, CEO Christian Lattmann tells us. In its workshops, 60 watchmakers and craftsmen create watches that are objets d'art. They range from off-centered Grande Seconde wristwatches, inspired by a Jaquet-Droz pocket watch with two intersecting dials forming a figure 8, to limited-edition pieces featuring exotic dials and wrist automatons. 
We begin in the showroom, where we meet ""Charlie,"" an android built in 2012 based on the Johnny Depp character Willy Wonka in the movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Charlie's hands hold two bells, which he raises to reveal current Jaquet Droz models. He is made of 2,693 mechanical parts and is animated by a system of 12 cams and 7 electric motors. 
Next, we see why Pierre Jaquet-Droz was considered a wizard. A technician shows us the master's ""Singing Bird Cage,"" made in 1780. It's a large, ornate, hanging cage, with a clock on the bottom, containing two birds. In the center of the cage, running top to bottom, is a crystal column. The technician winds the clock, and for 40 seconds a melody plays while the mechanical birds, with real bird feathers, chirp, moving their wings, beaks and tails, while 12 turning ""streams"" in the column create the illusion of a waterfall. The clock has six melodies, which can play on demand or on the hour. For our 21st century audience, it is amazing. For an 18th century audience, it must have been pure magic.
Knowing that we have just come from giant Omega, whose budgets for world-renowned ""ambassadors"" Lattmann can only dream of, he laughs as he tells me, ""The automata are our Cindy Crawford.""
Jaquet Droz's newest automaton wristwatch is the Magic Lotus Automaton. The dial features a small round watch face surrounded by a flowing steam. The watch dial is onyx and has two gold hands. The rest of the dial is brimming with decorative art creations that are Jaquet Droz's specialty.  
It depicts the four stages of a lotus flower: seed pods, bud, spring flower and fall flower. Two blue disks represent the stream. Also on the dial is a koi fish, a blue dragonfly, lotus leaves, water lilies, diamonds, sapphires, a ruby, and more. 
Push the button on the crown and the stream comes to life. The large disk rotates and the koi moves around the dial, flapping its tail and diving beneath the green lotus leaves. The water lilies bob up and down as the water flows. The entire animation runs for a full four minutes, with eight rotations of 30 seconds each. 
All the elements on the dial are made in workshops here. The koi and dragonfly are hand-carved in gold and painted; the lotus leaves and reed stems are made in Grand Feu enamel on a gold base; the lotus petals are carved from mother-of-pearl with a thin coat of translucent paint.   
The dial of the new Smalta Clara Hummingbird watch is made in plique-a-jour enamel crafted in Jaquet Droz workshops.
In the Atelier de Haute Horlogèrie (T2), each watch is assembled by hand by one watchmaker. Blancpain supplies Jaquet Droz with movements, which JD then modifies. Automata are manufactured in the Atelier Automaton, complete with a small sound studio to create chirping birds and other sounds. The movement in the new Magic Lotus watch, which took three years to develop, has 616 components; 500 of them are for the automaton. 
Painting, enameling, engraving, and sculpting are all done by hand in sunlit, monastery-quiet ateliers devoted to each craft.  
The Magic Lotus watch costs 200,000 Swiss francs before tax. JD will produce 28 pieces in red gold and 28 in white gold.
The main market for these pieces is Asia, Lattmann tells me. But demand is global. Last year, it sold all eight pieces of its remarkable Tropic Bird Repeater watch (price: CHF 650,000) in eight months, one to an American.
 
On Day 3, we head to Plan-les-Ouates on the outskirts of Geneva to visit the Harry Winston Manufacture. The Swatch Group acquired the famous New York diamond jewelry house in 2013 for $1 billion. Waiting to greet us is Nayla Hayek, CEO of Harry Winston, who is also chairwoman of the Swatch Group board of directors. ""You are very lucky,"" she tells us, underlining one of the reasons for the ""Time To Move"" press event. ""In Basel, you see only a few novelties. Here you will see all the novelties.""
In fact, we are lucky to be allowed inside this ultra-secure fortress at all, where millions of dollars worth of diamonds and gemstones are stored. We soon learn that the Time To Move press guests are the first outsiders ever shown the manufacturing ateliers.
While diamond jewelry is Winston's signature product, 180 employees here work on watches, Ms. Hayek tells us. Most of the watches are ladies' jewelry pieces.
It takes a week to produce the dial on Harry Winston's Premier Precious Micromosaic Automatic 36mm watch. It is hand-made using a mosaic glass setting and 14 brilliant-cut diamonds. 
Inside the gem-setting atelier, jewelers peer into Olympus SZ51 microscopes as they set cases, bracelets and dials with precious stones. We see jewelers setting the diamond-encrusted rectangular case of Harry Winston's Avenue Classic 20th Anniversary watches. The top-grade stones, set in Winston's famous ""invisible settings,"" are dazzling. It takes a jeweler four to five days to complete one case. 
Harry Winston watches use ETA movements primarily, mostly quartz in the ladies' pieces. The company gets its moon-phase complications for both ladies' and men's watches from Blancpain. 
Winston, of course, isn't only about women's watches. It has made high-profile forays into the high-mechanical world with its series of Opus and Histoire de Tourbillon watches and its use of exotic metals like zalium, a zirconium-aluminum alloy; the platinum-group metal ruthenium; and Winstonium, its exclusive platinum alloy. 
This year's men's headliner is the 10th and final piece in the Histoire de Tourbillon series. It's the first watch ever to include four separate tourbillons. The four tourbillons are positioned at the corners of the giant case, which extends horizontally along the wrist (45 mm x 32 mm x 12.85 m). They rotate once every 36 seconds, unified by three differentials. Histoire de Tourbillon 10 is a limited-edition of 21 pieces: 10 in rose gold, 10 in white gold (CHF750,000 each); and one in Winstonium (CHF770,000).
HW's newest zalium watch is Project Z13, also known as the Ocean Retrograde Automatic 42MM watch, with a zalium case and buckle. It's the first watch in the Zalium collection with a moon-phase display. This one, exclusive to HW, is unique: its shape is not round, but 12-sided, and it is suspended above the cut-out dial by transverse arms. Its automatic movement is made exclusively for Harry Winston. 
As for the Opus, we do not see the long-awaited Opus 15 (it's been nearly four years since the last one – the Opus 14 ""Jukebox For The Wrist""). However, the company says it expects to unveil it by the end of the year. 
 
We spend the afternoon with Glashütte Original in a hotel near the Geneva airport. GO's manufacture is nearly 500 miles away as the crow flies, in the famous watchmaking village of Glashütte in eastern Germany. Since the company can't bring the press to the manufacture, CEO Roland von Keith tells us (it's a long way from Geneva to Saxony), it brought the manufacture to the press. It set up a few manufacturing operations in the hotel ballroom. We're issued the obligatory white lab coats and head into the faux factory for a final round of novelties and technical presentations. 
In a temporary lab in the center of the room, two technicians perform some of the quality-control torture tests GO runs for shock-resistance and water-resistance. Elsewhere, around the room, watchmakers and technicians are performing demonstrations at benches.    
At one, a watchmaker is blueing screws. First, he mirror-polishes the tiny steel screw by hand, rubbing it on a polishing plate until it is glossy. This process protects it from corrosion. Then he places the screw, which is gray, on a small heating device on the workbench. The screw soon changes color, turning yellow, followed quickly by brown, red, violet, and then, at a temperature of 290° C, the color he desires: a deep blue, at which time he lifts it off the grill.
At the dial printing station, a technician from GO's dial factory in Pforzheim, Germany, demonstrates the ""pad printing"" process of manually applying logos on dials, one at a time. The pad-printing method uses a silicone or rubber ""balloon"" to pick up ink from a negative engraving, called a ""cliche."" Pulling the arm of the machine, the technician lowers the pad onto the negative. Then she slides the pad along a track to position it over a blank dial, and lowers the pad onto it. Voilà: the logo appears on the dial.
At another station, a watchmaker using a microscope is screwing 18 infinitesimal screws into a gold screw balance. The screw thread measures a ridiculous 0.35 mm – hence, the microscope. The watchmaker asks for a volunteer to perform the operation. Adam Craniotes, the irrepressible founder of the RedBar group, offers to be the guinea pig. Craniotes, like the rest of us, is sleep-deprived, which will hamper his dexterity. There's also a good chance he's sipped some of the fine Swiss wine served at lunch at Harry Winston, which won't help either. Amazingly, after a few tries, he manages to pick up a screw with the tweezers. But, alas, he drops it. Our gang groans when he lets us know. One of the group points to the screw, which landed on the counter top. It looks like a single speck of table salt. Craniotes doubles down. After repeated attempts, he manages to pick up another screw, and, mirabile dictu, screws it into a hole. He gets a hero's applause from his admiring peers. Now, only 17 more to go. He leaves those for the pro.
The episode drives home a major theme of the trip. We knew fine watchmaking was complicated. But we come away with a new understanding of just how devilishly difficult it is. And a deeper appreciation for those special souls who master its crafts.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has a busy 10 days ahead of him.
He’s in Pyongyang now, as you’re reading this newsletter, meeting with Kim Jong Un on how to defuse the stalemate with the U.S. over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Then at the end of the month, he’ll be sitting down with President Donald Trump in Japan to try and iron out their differences on trade.
And as distinct as each of these two issues may appear, they were long ago melded into one by Trump.
Help America rein in North Korea, Trump told Xi in 2017, and Beijing will get a more favorable trade deal. It’ll also stop the U.S. from labeling China a currency manipulator.
Beijing’s sway over Pyongyang is substantial, and its decision to support sanctions against Kim’s regime has had a painful impact on North Korea’s economy. How much Trump’s petitions have affected Chinese decision-making is far harder to gauge.

Finding a peaceful solution to the decades-long conundrum on the Korean peninsula would be a considerable achievement and one Trump would undoubtedly burnish. He’s already boosted of being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic efforts.
It may well be Xi’s ability to foster a détente between Pyongyang and Washington that becomes the pivot on which the trade war turns.
And of course that could all be wrong. If the trajectory of the trade war continues to escalate, Giant Manufacturing will be one of the companies that saw it coming first. The world’s largest maker of bicycles began moving production  out of China last September when Chairwoman Bonnie Tu says she realized the “Made in China” era had come to an end. Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch also warned investors this week not to ignore the possibility of  a protracted trade war. The bank’s analysts’ see tighter Chinese capital controls and threats to Hong Kong’s role as a financial center being among the potential fallout.
Trade isn’t all Hong Kong is dealing with. The city’s chief executive Carrie Lam “paused” the controversial extradition bill that had prompted hundreds of thousands to protest. That's not stopped calls for Lam to resign. But so far, the spillover for business appears limited. Home sales have continued at brisk pace and the city’s exchange is preparing for Alibaba’s secondary listing, which could raise as much as $20 billion. That’d make it Hong Kong second-largest share sale ever.

Another hot topic of conversation for financial markets in Hong Kong and China was the ongoing controversy surrounding UBS economist Paul Donovan's use of the phrase ""Chinese pig"" in a note about pork prices and inflation. China Railway Construction Corp. this week excluded UBS from a bond sale after the comment set off a furor on Chinese social media. That was after the Swiss bank placed Donovan on leave and the Chinese Securities Association of Hong Kong called on UBS to fire those involved.  
Meanwhile, if you're looking for a place to get away for a while, consider Chengdu. The capital of Sichuan province, long famous for its spicy cuisine, is also becoming known for its acceptance of the LGBT community. Businesses are already paying attention, in Chengdu and more broadly in China. The country's so-called rainbow economy, worth about $300 billion a year, is creating new opportunities for companies such as Blued, a gay dating app that also helps couples who want children find overseas surrogates. It's also changing corporate behavior. Weibo, the popular microblogging site, last year reversed a decision to remove content with gay themes after it was bombarded with opposition.
And finally, a look at China's plan to reward good behavior and punish bad through a social credit system. About a dozen local governments have so far rolled out trial versions, but not without problems. In Suzhou, for example, almost none of the residents are aware their city has a social credit system, or that they've already got scores. It's hard to affect behavior with social scores people don't know exist. Bickering between various government bureaucracies has been another issue. That of course doesn't mean the system won't become more effective with time, nor does it assuage concerns that it will be used to suppress dissent. But for now, the social credit system looks more like Kafka than Orwell.

Jerome Powell is ready to lower rates, but not yet. The FOMC shrugged off pressure from President Trump for an immediate cut, leaving its benchmark unchanged while indicating a readiness to ease for the first time in more than a decade. Fed officials cited economic ""uncertainties,"" dropped their ""patient"" mantra and forecast a larger miss of their 2% inflation target this year. Traders are fully expecting a cut next month.
The number of Iran accusers is growing as evidence mounts that the Islamic Republic was responsible for recent oil tanker attacks. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said there is ""little question"" the country's was behind the action. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Trump skeptic, agreed.

Airbus continued its dominance at the Paris Air Show's third day. Orders for its new long-range jet have poured in from eight customers, including American Airlines, which will purchase 20 new planes, valued at about $2.84 billion, and convert 30 existing orders. The French company is now firmly in the lead over Boeing on order count at the annual faceoff. The Seattle jetmaker had scored a mega-deal yesterday with a sale of its troubled 737 Max to British Airways; today, famed pilot Chelsey ""Sully"" Sullenberger said the model shouldn't be allowed to carry passengers until it can be tested in simulators.
Apple is ramping up a test of a digital-first credit card with Goldman Sachs by adding tens of thousands of its own retail workers to the effort, according to people familiar, the card's first major trial. Sheryl Sandberg said Facebook's Libra, a cryptocurrency pegged to government-backed securities, is a ""long way from launch"" and faces a steep climb to win over regulators. Walmart is betting on a less glamorous innovation: driverless trucks that move on fixed routes between warehouses rather than more complicated home delivery runs. Automating these ""milk run"" middle miles is a cost cutter that could turn into a $1 trillion market.
Dell, HP, Intel and Microsoft joined the chorus of companies urging President Trump to refrain from issuing more tariffs on Chinese goods, including laptops and tablets. The companies submitted joint comments opposing the tariff escalation, saying it would hurt consumer products and industry while failing to address China's trade practices, especially since the levies would hit during the peak holiday and back-to-school sales periods. Just don't bring that up with your neighbor: Half of Americans say talking politics in the Trump era is ""stressful and frustrating,"" and most blame the president for the negative tone, according to a Pew poll.
Disney is reaching deep to make Avengers: Endgame the biggest movie of all time with plans to re-release the superhero film next weekend with new footage that wasn't included in the original. It aims to top Avatar as the all-time global box-office champion, a film released by Twentieth Century Fox, which it now owns. Endgame has grossed $2.7 billion worldwide since April release, while James Cameron's 2009 blockbuster leads with almost $2.8 billion, not adjusted for inflation.

The apparent victory of Hong Kong protesters and a mini-thaw in Russia suggest the two regimes are using a technique known as ""contained escalation,"" writes Leonid Bershidsky of Bloomberg Opinion. If that's the case, activists will end up realizing they can get the rulers' favorable attention if they make small demands and show willingness to negotiate. However, demanding more will only get them beaten up and thrown behind bars.
China's surveillance-based social-credit program is more Kafka than Orwell, Bloomberg Opinion's David Fickling writes. It creates nonsensical, disorganized oppression, not minute control by a monolithic state. Like L.A.'s ""predictive policing"" project—racial profiling with a Silicon Valley sheen—it's more likely to just reproduce the problems of the existing system of petty oppression.
Don't call it weed, call it cannabis. It's not legalization, it's regulation and monetization. And skip the pot puns. That's the crusade of Bruce Linton, the Canadian CEO of $15 billion Canopy Growth, the world's biggest, um, pot company. He's occasionally partial to pink slippers with marijuana leaf embroidery, yet doesn't smoke, vape or eat brownies. In his bid for growth, he's got a deal with Corona beer maker Constellation, bought a U.S. grower for $3 billion and has seen Canopy stock jump sevenfold in two years. Now if only he could get America to regulate.
Chengdu is known for its spicy food. But the capital of Sichuan province is also now gaining a reputation as an LGBT haven. It was voted the gay capital of China in a recent poll by same-sex dating app Blued. Lower rents have lured young people, cultivating a hip, progressive culture that's spawned San Francisco-style cafes and the nickname ""Gaydu.""

Craig Wright famously (in some circles) declared himself the inventor of Bitcoin. Some call him a fraud, including Vitalik Buterin, the known creator of competing digital currency Ether. Wright responded by suing Buterin for defamation, as well as a podcaster and an early Bitcoin investor. In true crypto ethos, Buterin says it is a fight about censorship, free speech and truth. Wright says it is a sabotage of his efforts to stop illegal uses of the currency. ""I designed Bitcoin to stop all of this,"" he says. ""That is why they hate me.""
Three Russians and a Ukrainian were charged by a Joint Investigation Team for the downing of the MH17 passenger jet five years ago which killed 298 people. The team cited a phone call and other evidence they say proves a link between Russia and the breakaway Donetsk region, which was at war with Ukraine. International arrest warrants have been issued, with court proceedings set to begin in March. Meanwhile, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was implicated in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by a UN investigator who said she found ""credible evidence"" warranting further investigation into the Saudi leader's culpability, but no smoking gun.
Sorry guys, you're not special. Lululemon has quietly closed its men's standalone stores in New York City and Toronto.

The U.S. is considering sanctions to punish Turkey for buying a Russian missile system, people familiar said. The most severe package under discussion will effectively cripple Turkey's economy. The idea with the most support for now is to target several companies in its defense sector. But President Erdogan thinks he can persuade Trump that buying the S-400 isn't a big problem, other people said.

Elliott Management is preparing to compromise with Vivendi on board representation that would be accompanied by a pledge to pursue a common strategy. Ten out of Telecom Italia's 15 board directors are aligned with Elliott and the rest with Vivendi.
It's not always good to talk. As Danske Bank started calling analysts this week to add some color to its second-quarter results, the company's stock price started falling. The calls, which are routinely made by companies to ensure market expectations don't stray too far from reality, gave at least two analysts cause for concern. By the close of trading yesterday, Danske was the worst-performing financial stock in Europe.

None of the hopefuls connected with the audience, and those asking the questions looked either unimpressed or disgusted. No wonder the Tories are so fearful of an election.

Asian stocks rose, building on gains in global shares amid optimism over progress on the U.S.-China trade front and indications of more stimulus from the European Central Bank. The rally came after President Donald Trump tweeted he will meet Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week. All eyes are now on the Fed, which ends its two-day meeting today. 
Japan's exports fell for a sixth straight month, as the impact of trade tensions and slowing global demand weighed. The value of shipments dropped 7.8% in May from a year earlier, less than the consensus. The trade balance was a deficit of 967.1 billion yen ($8.9 billion). Meanwhile,  the yield on its benchmark government bonds fell to a fresh three-year low amid signs global central banks are turning even more dovish.  
Trump may slap sanctions on Turkey as soon as July as punishment for the purchase of Russia's S-400 missile system, people familiar said. Three options are being considered and the one with the most support involves targeting defense companies. The most severe package under discussion between officials at the National Security Council and the State and Treasury departments would all but cripple the already troubled Turkish economy. The lira plunged.

The RBA's easing cycle could take its key policy rate as low as 0.5%, according to BlackRock. ""I've no doubt that the RBA wouldn't have an issue taking the cash rate below 1%,"" the firm's Craig Vardy said. The world's largest asset manager is betting the Aussie will extend declines to as low as 65 U.S. cents as a result.
Nomura surged 11%, the most in more than two years, after it announced a surprise $1.4 billion share buyback along with plans to reduce its chairman's role to bolster governance. Shareholders are due to gather on Monday for its AGM.
Currency wars are starting to   flare again, Robert Burgess writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Central banks and government officials have few other choices than to seek a weaker currency to make their economies more competitive. China has allowed its yuan to weaken, and it's probably only a matter of time before Japan tries to jawbone the yen lower. Trump isn't wrong to be concerned about the dollar.
Boris Johnson is all but certain to be the next Tory leader, but it's Rory Stewart who has reshaped the race, the Guardian's Tom Kibasi says. ""By speaking with clarity and sincerity and engaging with the public and journalists, Stewart has thrown the mendaciousness and evasiveness of Johnson into sharp relief. ""This means that Johnson will seize a tarnished crown if he succeeds in his bid for the premiership.""
The Fed and BOJ can learn a thing or two from ECB President Mario Draghi, Daniel Moss writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Instead of lamenting about the lack of ammunition, Draghi is going to fight the slowdown anyway he can, undeterred by negative rates and the retirement of QE. The major central banks don't need to keep coming up with new tricks. The old ones could work just as well, with the right timing.
Apple, Google and Facebook are raiding animal research labs, looking to hire those who work there. Neuroscientists studying birds, mice, and fish are landing seven-figure salaries to help advance artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and more. Some doctoral students in the area are even getting jobs before they have a degree, according to one Harvard professor.

Chengdu is known for its spicy food. The capital of Sichuan province is also now gaining a reputation as a haven for the LGBT community. It was voted the gay capital of China in a recent poll by gay dating app Blued. Less-expensive rents have lured young people, cultivating a hip, progressive culture that's spawned San Francisco-style cafes filled with millennials and the nickname ""Gaydu.""
Bitcoin has surged about 150% this year and there's been a thaw in the U.S. among cryptocurrency-exposed equities as mainstream players like Facebook and JPMorgan enter the space. But it's yet to translate to gains for Asia's more prominent crypto-linked stocks. Monex Group, Remixpoint, Vidente and BC Technology are all lower in 2019.
China's most advanced Big Brother experiment seems to be more bark than bite. A review of Suzhou's ""Osmanthus"" data-collection system, meant to change individual behavior by tracking more than two dozen metrics from marital status to educational levels, shows up a bureaucratic mess that few people even know about. ""China has an interest in overstating its capacity to collect and analyze data,"" said Yale's Jeremy Daum. ""They want people to believe that misconduct will get caught.""
Now it's Li Ka-shing's turn to support some students. The Hong Kong billionaire's foundation said it will pay tuition for all undergraduates in the incoming class of 2019 for four to five years at Shantou University. The institution is in Guangdong, the southern Chinese province Li came from as a refugee to Hong Kong decades ago. The foundation has committed to an annual grant of 100 million yuan ($14.5 million) to the university. The move comes a month after Vista's Robert F. Smith vowed to pay off the loans of students at Morehouse College's class of 2019."
41,BLU,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/chengdu-is-tapping-into-china-s-300-billion-rainbow-economy,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/chengdu-is-tapping-into-china-s-300-billion-rainbow-economy,"June 18, 2019, 6:00 PM EDT",A $300 Billion Rainbow Economy Is Booming in the Middle of China,"Kate Thomson (center) with friends outside the Underground, an LGBT-friendly bar she manages in Chengdu that hosts a weekly pride night.
It’s 11 p.m. at AMO, an underground lesbian nightclub in Chengdu, and 17 women—in androgynous clothing, their hair closely cropped—line up at the front door to welcome partygoers. Among them is Yang Yang, 25, who started working at AMO (Esperanto for “love”) more than three years ago when she moved to the Sichuan capital in the southwest of China. In that time she’s earned enough to buy a 645-square-foot loft. “I can have fun and drink while making money,” says Yang, who’d trained to be a kindergarten teacher. “How much better does it get than that?”
Yang, her workplace, and her apartment are all part of China’s growing rainbow economy: the ecosystem of consumers, companies, and workers that serve the nation’s LGBT population. State media estimate that this segment of the nation’s economy is worth $300 billion a year—making it the world’s third-largest after Europe and the U.S., they say—fueling a consumer base that companies are eagerly, if cautiously, trying to tap.
“Companies are getting braver, but they can do more and will do more as they grow more accustomed to the market,” says Darius Longarino, a senior fellow at the Yale Law School Paul Tsai China Center who studies LGBT issues in China. “I understand their caution, because things can change with the snap of a finger. And there’s a perception that in China nothing’s allowed unless it’s explicitly allowed.”
A world away from Beijing, Chengdu has become a haven for the LGBT community, whose members are drawn to the relaxed, open vibe. The city sits in a basin surrounded by mountains, which kept it isolated for centuries. Fertile ground and abundant natural resources allowed it to stay mostly self-sufficient, with an attitude that’s both “mind your own business” and “anything goes.” The city of 16 million, best known internationally for its pandas, was voted the gay capital of China in a recent poll by gay dating app Blued. Less-expensive rents have lured young people, cultivating a hip, progressive culture that’s spawned San Francisco-style cafes filled with millennials. Economic growth is comfortable, with last year’s 8% expansion well above the national rate.
“Before I got into college, I probably had never met anyone who is gay, but here this feels like home because all our close friends are gay or bi,” says Katherine Guo, 19, a university student who moved to Chengdu from Guangzhou, a commercial center farther south. “When I was back home, I never told anyone I was bisexual—literally nobody.”
While there aren’t official statistics on Chengdu’s LGBT population, the nickname “Gaydu” has stuck. A 2018 study by Tongle Health Counseling Service Center, the oldest nongovernmental organization serving its gay community, estimated there were 140,500 gay men in the city. Although China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from an official list of mental disorders in 2001, gay, lesbian, and transsexual individuals still live in a gray area. There’s no law against being LGBT, but no rules protect against discrimination, either. China doesn’t recognize gay marriage.
Given this tension, established companies have tried to reach out in subtle ways. Earlier this year, Starbucks Corp. sold rainbow-themed mugs and tumblers that were snapped up. The items included the phrase “Love Is Love,” with no explicit mention of LGBT rights. In 2015, after the U.S. legalized gay marriage, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., its online shopping site Taobao, and Blued held a competition to send seven same-sex couples to Hollywood to get married. They received more than 400 submissions. This year, brands including Bayer, Coach, Diesel, Old Navy, and Shake Shack supported the annual ShanghaiPRIDE week.
In Chengdu, small companies make everything from cellphone cases emblazoned with rainbow colors to designer condoms, and one entrepreneur launched two lesbian-friendly apartment buildings in 2016. (Members of the LGBT community say they sometimes feel they need to hide their sexual orientation from landlords.) Shops on Taobao cater to lesbians such as Yang, who call themselves T’s (for Tomboys), selling masculine clothing in female sizes. Companies offering surrogacy services often hand out flyers at LGBT events.
Still, success depends on toeing the line. Gaydorado, a mobile game that lets players star as a heartthrob in a gay-friendly metropolis, has about 20,000 daily active users who spend several million yuan per month on in-game items. But it doesn’t have the government license required for domestic distribution, and Chinese players must use a technical loophole to gain access, as they do to play some Western blockbuster titles.
The right approach is key, especially since the government can be unpredictable—­supportive at times, then punitive when invisible lines are crossed. In 2017 popular lesbian dating app Rela was shut down after it backed an event in Shanghai to raise awareness for LGBT rights. (It later relaunched.) At other times, the authorities have sought to highlight their tolerance. When China hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008, state-run news agency Xinhua ran a feature promoting nightspot Destination as “Beijing’s hottest gay club.”
“It’s kind of a message to the Western world that LGBT in China, they’re not really living in a very oppressive environment,” says Edmund Yang, who founded the bar 15 years ago. It’s since grown into a gay institution—a four-story complex with an outdoor cafe, art gallery, multicultural center, and clinic that offers free HIV testing.
Blued says there were about 70 million LGBT people in China in 2016, based on the estimate that roughly 5% of the global population is LGBT. But most don’t live an out-and-proud lifestyle: A United Nations Development Programme study of sexual orientation in China that same year found that only 5% of sexual and gender minorities have come out.
Chengdu and other second-tier cities with large LGBT populations, including Chongqing and Hangzhou, are largely ignored by big companies marketing to the demographic, according to operators of gay and lesbian establishments. “I think a lot of big companies don’t do anything outside Beijing and Shanghai because they don’t know that Chengdu and Chongqing have a big LGBT population,” says Kate Thomson, who manages Underground, an LGBT-friendly bar in Chengdu that hosts a weekly pride night. “You can get away with more in Chengdu because it’s under the radar.”
In a survey of more than 7,500 LGBT individuals in China conducted by Blued and gay rights organization Danlan, more than half of respondents indicated that corporations’ support for LGBT policies play the biggest role in influencing their purchasing decisions. According to consultant LGBT Capital, those consumers have a purchasing power of $541 billion.
One company that’s betting on that rainbow economy is AMO, which also has clubs in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Chongqing. It’s planning to open another in Shanghai this year and expand to more cities in 2020. “When we first opened, we didn’t expect demand would be so great even though Chengdu is dubbed the ‘nation of LGBT,’ ” says Xiao Bai, who manages the clubs nationwide. “The desire to find a place to relax, have fun, and date is very strong.” —Sharon Chen and Han Miao, with  Zheping Huang and Dandan Li

The Food and Drug Administration submitted the proposal to U.S. District Judge Paul Grimm in Maryland after he ruled last month in a lawsuit filed by anti-tobacco groups that the agency had illegally allowed e-cigarettes to stay on the market without a safety and public health review.
“The recent epidemic-level rise in youth e-cigarette use is a mounting public health crisis” that requires a robust regulatory response, the FDA said in the remedy brief filed Wednesday.
The plaintiffs want the judge to require companies that make e-cigarettes and cigars to submit applications within 120 days. Grimm will consider both proposals and issue an order that takes them into account.
The FDA also said in the brief that it would aim to finish a draft guideline it put out in March that would ban most flavored e-cigarettes from retail stores within four months.

The FDA began overseeing e-cigarettes in 2016 under the Obama administration. After Donald Trump took office the next year, the agency said it would push back until 2022 a requirement that vape companies submit applications to continue selling their products. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said at the time that he wanted to ensure that a fledgling industry with the potential to reduce harmful cigarette smoking wasn’t stymied by regulation.
Plaintiffs, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the American Academy of Pediatrics, sued the FDA over the delay last year.
Tobacco stocks dipped slightly after the news, with British American Tobacco Plc dropping as much as 1.3% in London. Imperial Brands Plc, which makes Blu e-cigarettes, fell as much as 0.6%. Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc., which took a $12.8 billion stake in Juul last year, was down 0.8% in early trading in New York.
The FDA proposed that a product could still be sold for a year while its application was under review, with some case-by-case discretion for extensions to applicants making progress at completing their filings.
The timing proposed by the FDA would “strike a better balance among public health considerations, and allow the agency some time to prepare to absorb a flood of applications significantly sooner than anticipated,” the agency said in the brief.
The FDA issued a guideline Tuesday to help e-cigarette makers craft applications for review, clearing the way for the agency to move more quickly.

Manhattan condo owners who’ve enjoyed property-tax reductions are heading for the exits of their posh buildings as their breaks are set to expire.
At a sampling of five buildings where the city’s 421-a tax abatement will end this year or next, owners are listing a greater share of apartments for resale compared with other large Manhattan condo towers, according to StreetEasy. Often, they’re not finding takers until the price drops close to -- or less than -- what the seller paid years ago.
“People aren’t willing to pay the same amount for something that’s going to cost them more on a monthly basis,” said Grant Long, senior economist with the listings website. “Figuring out what the right price is, given the expiring abatements, is going to be a challenge over time.”

Manhattan’s would-be buyers are weighing potential purchases cautiously these days, refusing to overpay for homes and causing years of rapid price increases to come to a halt. They’re also tax-sensitive, thanks to new rules that limit how much of their property levies can get written off on federal returns.

Thousands of Manhattan condos built before the 2008 downturn benefited from the now-defunct 421-a, in which developers received property-tax breaks and passed them along to buyers as a way to promote sales in their pricey buildings. Under the program, an apartment’s property-tax burden would be phased in over 10 or 15 years, with the first few years fully exempt. The abatement’s expiration means the unit is subject to the full tax bill.
Buyers -- owners who live in the units and investors who rent them out -- paid top dollar for condos with low carrying costs, probably reasoning they’d recoup their investments by selling at a big profit before their abatements ended, Long said. That strategy won’t work in today’s saturated market.
“The difference between a building with a tax abatement and a building without is probably an additional $400,000 on the purchase price,” said Alon Chadad, broker and co-founder of Blu Real Estate, which is marketing listings at Upper West Side properties with expiring abatements.
At the Avery, a tower at 100 Riverside Blvd. where the breaks will end this year, about 11% of the building’s 266 units were offered for sale at some point between last May and mid-May of this year, according to StreetEasy. By comparison, condo properties across Manhattan with 50 or more units had a median of 4.8% of their units listed in the same time period.
Next door at the Rushmore, where abatements expire in 2020, 8.9% of the units were listed for sale within the past year. That’s about the same share as at the Caledonia in Chelsea, where the breaks also expire in 2020, and Sky House, at 11 E. 29th St., where they end this year.
The apartments are “becoming less attractive for the investors to hold onto, which is why you see so many listed, and they’re also becoming less attractive to buy,” Long said.
100 Riverside Boulevard #19B
At the Avery, a two-bedroom unit on the 19th floor purchased for $2.05 million in 2014 is still seeking a buyer at $1.795 million, after a year on the market. On the 10th floor of the same tower, a one-bedroom marketed by Chadad, for which the seller paid $936,790 in 2008, is in contract after three price cuts, according to StreetEasy. The deal will close this month at $952,750, he said.
“It’s one of those buildings where anybody who bought in ’08 or ’09 would be lucky to break even,” Chadad said. “That’s what we’ve been seeing these last few months.”

Companies like Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc., MacroGenics Inc. and Nektar Therapeutics will be in the spotlight when the annual event kicks off Friday in Chicago.
“Sentiment heading into the conference is notably bland, but there should still be enough stock-specific events to keep us on our toes,” Baird analyst Brian Skorney said in a note to clients. The firm is focused on updated data from Iovance after an initial abstract sent shares soaring on the promise of a cell therapy that may work in solid tumors.
The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has fallen 12% from its March highs as investors lamented some high-profile drug failures and a lack of big deals. ASCO has historically been a positive spark for the sector, although this year’s meeting has drawn noticeably less buzz than some previous editions.
“It’s not fair to call it a down year,” said Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, in a phone interview. The focus this weekend will be on smaller individual presentations rather than large blockbuster drugs, he said.
Iovance shares jumped 7% on Friday before paring gains. Updated results for its cell therapies showed signs of durability in solid tumors as two more patients responded to the company’s treatment in cervical cancer. Iovance updates are seen as “very positive” by Cowen analyst Boris Beaker, who suggests a response duration of 9 months to a year will be needed “to gain significant traction” in skin cancer.
Iovance has gained 57% since initial results were presented in an abstract ahead of the meeting earlier this month.
The most closely watched large-cap drugmaker at the meeting will be Amgen Inc. as it presents early results on a treatment targeting a common cancer mutation known as KRAS. Clinicians have been targeting KRAS mutations for 30 years and Amgen may finally be showing that it is a “druggable” target, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Separately, Blueprint Medicines Corp.’s data on BLU-667 will show how competitive it is with Eli Lilly & Co.’s LOXO-292 in lung cancer.
Here are the companies to watch (all times are Chicago time and subject to change):
Investors are looking for a deepening of responses for Amgen’s AMG 510. The drug targets a specific mutation in the KRAS family that is frequently tied to lung tumors and some colon cancers.
A 25% response rate is the bar for AMG 510 to be “clinically meaningful,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Asthika Goonewardene wrote. Small-cap peer Mirati Therapeutics Inc. makes a similar medicine and could move as much as 30% if Amgen’s drug has positive data, JPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama said.
The data will be presented June 3, followed by investor meeting webcast at 6:30 p.m.
Options in Amgen scheduled to expire on June 7 are anticipating a share price move of 3.3% between now and next Friday.
AstraZeneca Plc and Merck are presenting late-breaking results for their “Polo” study of Lynparza as a maintenance treatment in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer. This may have implications for Clovis Oncology Inc. as the small-cap drugmaker is also planning to pursue pancreatic cancer, SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens wrote.
Findings will be presented at a plenary session on June 2 at 3:15 p.m.
Data from part of the registrational “Arrow” trial of Blueprint’s BLU-667 in RET-altered lung and thyroid cancers is to be presented June 3. BLU-667 would potentially vie with Lilly’s LOXO-292, where both companies have shown competitive efficacy. Investors will be looking at safety and “difficulty benchmarking BLU-667” may drive volatility in Blueprint shares, Berens said.
Investor event will be webcast on Monday at 6:30 p.m.
Results from “Columba” and “Cassiopeia,” late-stage studies of Darzalex in multiple myeloma will be presented on Sunday and Monday.
Citi said that Columba data could drive premium pricing for subcutaneous Darzalex in the U.S. Deutsche Bank said the drug faces limited risk from Sanofi’s presentation of competing CD38 antibody isatuximab, “given Darzalex’s established presence as gold standard.”
Oppenheimer analyst Mark Breidenbach expects Iovance to have a “strong presence at ASCO, with new clinical data expected for two Phase 2 programs in the company’s pipeline of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies.” This includes results from over 60 patients in one arm of the ongoing “innovaTIL-01” trial of lifileucel in melanoma and a “significant update” from the “innovaTIL-04” study of the next-generation cell therapy, LN-145, in cervical cancer.
Iovance will present data on June 1.
Ipsen SA’s presentations include Exelixis Inc.-partnered Cabometyx as well as Onivyde and Somatuline. Oddo BHF said last week that Ipsen is among the top 15 oncology companies.
The initial abstract for Cabometyx in gastrointestinal tumors left Stifel analyst Stephen Willey’s enthusiasm for the drug “muted for now.”
Late-stage results from the “Sophia” study of MacroGenics’s margetuximab in HER2-positive breast cancer will be a “battleground” between bulls and bears, said Loncar. Wall Street wanted to see around a two-month difference on progression-free survival compared to Herceptin, but data in the abstract fell short. Investors will be looking for an update on overall survival, and Loncar said “six months would be spectacular.”
A conference call is scheduled for June 4 at 1:30 p.m.
Piper Jaffray said investors are looking for durability data from a combination of NKTR-214 with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Opdivo in a poster on sarcomas being presented Saturday.
Shares of Nektar have fallen about 60% over the past 12 months after disappointing data in melanoma at last year’s meeting. Sarcoma and updated melanoma data might give Nektar a chance “to get back in investors’ good graces,” Loncar said.
The June 7, at-the-money straddle in Nektar Therapeutics is implying a share price move of 10% between today and next Friday’s expiration.
For Puma Biotechnology Inc., data from the “Nala” study in breast cancer “do not appear clinically compelling” and likely won’t expand the market for oral therapies targeting HER2-positive breast cancer, Leerink said.
Puma Biotechnology options scheduled to expire on June 7 are implying an 11% move in shares over the next 7 days.
Data on Roche’s entrectinib, which showed promise in difficult-to-treat childhood brain tumors, will be presented June 2 at 8 a.m.
Sanofi is expected to present late-stage data for antibody isatuximab in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma on June 2.
Late-breaking results from Seattle Genetics Inc.’s “EV-201” study of enfortumab vedotin will be presented June 3 around 9:24 a.m.
“Given the unmet medical need following checkpoint and platinum therapy, a duration of 6.5-7.5 months should be viewed positively among investors,” William Blair’s Matt Phipps wrote.

Over 15 years the Bolivian businessman built it into a regional powerhouse as Latin America’s second-largest carrier.
But for all its success, the Bogota-based company is now back on a rocky foundation. Its stock price is down by almost 75% since it went public in 2011 and its bonds are trading in distressed territory amid concerns it will struggle to refinance debt. Avianca’s first-quarter loss was the biggest since 2015.
The man most responsible for the mess is the same who so recently was treated as a hero -- Efromovich.
German Efromovich
The self-made millionaire imperiled the airline’s future by last year offering up his 51.5% stake in Avianca as collateral on a loan from United Continental Holdings Inc. His holding company BRW Aviation quickly breached terms of the contract and, as a result, control of Avianca could pass to United’s hands. While that would likely be a positive for Avianca’s minority shareholders and bondholders, the current uncertainty has created myriad problems for the airline just as it faces down a $550 million bond coming due next year.
“We’re very worried by the company’s instability at the moment,” said Jaime Hernandez, president of the Colombian pilots’ union ACDAC, which in 2017 went on strike for almost two months over a wage and benefits dispute. “We were a great company and the management of it recently has been very bad for our operations, our reputation.”
Efromovich, who is also Avianca Holdings SA’s chairman, said in a radio interview in Bogota on Tuesday that there was no possibility of United taking over anytime soon. Avianca’s situation was “controlled,” he told Blu Radio.
In a written response to questions from Bloomberg, he denied that problems at his other businesses are creating risks for Avianca, which isn’t party to the loan. “Everything is aligned with United as per the loan agreement. There is nothing to rectify,” he wrote.
United says it hasn’t seized the Avianca shares and is working with BRW.
But it’s an option it could exercise at any point. Doing so would trigger change-of-control provisions on various loans that could force the airline to come up with roughly $1.5 billion to pay off creditors, according to analysts at Bogota-based brokerage Corredores Davivienda. That’s more than four times the amount of cash it had on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter.
Even if United doesn’t take control, just the fact that it could do so complicates Avianca’s efforts to operate and raise financing. Investors are hesitant to lend to a company that could at a moment’s notice be on the hook for a bunch of money that it doesn’t have.
Chief Financial Officer Roberto Held said Avianca is working urgently to amend loan contracts to account for the situation and still plans to sell bonds this quarter to pay off notes due next year. Meanwhile, it’s sticking to a business plan focused on cutting debt and increasing profitability by selling assets, canceling aircraft orders and scrapping some routes.
The tumult couldn’t have come at a worse time for Avianca. It has been buffeted by surging fuel prices this year along with weaker Latin American currencies and less demand for air travel amid slowdowns in the region’s biggest economies. Chief Executive Officer Hernan Rincon quit in April. And low-cost carriers are adding competition.
Avianca is only the latest difficulty for Efromovich, who has seen parts of the sprawling Latin American conglomerate he built with his brother, Jose, unravel in recent years. His shipyards have shut down. His Brazilian airline was forced to seek court protection from creditors. And now he’s at risk of losing Avianca.
It’s quite a turnaround from 2004, when Efromovich was lauded across Colombia for rescuing the world’s second-oldest airline. (Its first flight was in 1920, ferrying passengers between the municipalities of Barranquilla and Puerto Berrio.) Previously owned by the country’s richest family, it was hemorrhaging money in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the global recession that followed.
Efromovich bought it out of Chapter 11 for $64 million and an assumption of debt. A mechanical engineer by training who got into the aviation business in Brazil, Efromovich doubled the number of aircraft Avianca operated and soon started turning a profit. By last year, Avianca’s 190 aircraft were carrying 30 million passengers, second only to Latam Airlines in the region.
Former President Alvaro Uribe, who granted Efromovich Colombian citizenship in 2005, was among his biggest fans. “We Colombians admire you, we appreciate you, we value you, we consider you an example” of the type of investor the country needs, he said in 2010 when Efromovich received a “businessman of the year” award from newspaper La Republica.
Efromovich’s personal fortune began to turn in 2014, at the start of Brazil’s worst recession on record. He took a loan from Elliott Management to prop up his shipyard business there, which ended up closing.
Meanwhile, Efromovich moved ahead with expansion plans for Avianca, forming a joint venture with United and Panama’s Copa Holdings in which the three airlines would coordinate routes and schedules. Related to the deal, Efromovich’s BRW Aviation borrowed $456 million from United to pay off loans taken by his Brazilian businesses, using his stake in Avianca as collateral.
In April, Avianca said in a regulatory filing that BRW Aviation was in breach of a collateral coverage term of the United loan. That was partly because Avianca’s share price plummeted, causing its market capitalization to dip to $510 million by the end of 2018.
The possibility of a change in control has forced Avianca executives to seek to amend agreements to list United as a potential controlling shareholder. In addition to the bonds due next year, Avianca owes roughly $800 million to European export credit agencies, quasi-government financial institutions that secure funding for exporters, among other debts, according to executives.
Avianca needs to update loan contracts to include United as a potential controlling shareholder “to prevent a breach of the company’s financial commitments,” S&P Global Ratings said in a May 13 note. It downgraded the debt rating further into junk territory, the CCC+ level, citing “higher refinancing risk” due to BRW’s breach.
Of course the loan isn’t Avianca’s only headache, and some observers say Efromovich is getting too much of the blame for the company’s woes.
“The current problems are in good part due to Avianca, a business that has had bad numbers in recent quarters,” said Carlos Enrique Rodriguez, an analyst at Bogota brokerage Ultraserfinco who recommends selling the shares. “Corporate governance has been questioned and that has affected the stock price. But to say Avianca’s problems are all the fault of Efromovich is not entirely fair.”
In the long term, a change in control to United could be a positive for Avianca, said Gimme Credit analyst Cedric Rimaud, who recommends buying the bonds.
“There is still one year before the bonds come due and a lot can happen until then,” he wrote in a report. “If United takes over the control of the company, it will be a very positive news for bondholders, as the credit profile would improve markedly.”
But for now, investors seem doubtful of Avianca’s prospects.
The rating downgrade accelerated a sell-off in the bonds that began at the end of April. The notes due next May now trade at about 88 cents on the dollar, pushing the yield to 23%, according to Trace bond trading data. It’s among the worst performers this year in the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Corporates bond index.
“At first the assumption was that the problems were isolated” to just Efromovich and his outside businesses, said Roger Horn, a senior emerging-markets strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York. “But everything becomes a factor when an emerging-market company is looking to refinance a $550 million bond.”

Carlos Ghosn, who served as chairman and chief executive officer of the world’s biggest auto alliance, added another title to his resume today: defendant.
Pre-trial hearings began Thursday at the Tokyo District Court’s 17th Criminal Court Division, kicking off a new phase in a saga that started in November when Ghosn was arrested just after landing at Haneda Airport on a private jet. Ghosn, wearing a grey suit, didn’t say anything before entering courthouse just before the 10 a.m. meeting.
His detention on allegations ranging from falsifying financial records to redirecting company money into his own accounts shocked the global auto industry. The alliance Ghosn created between Nissan Motor Co., Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was shaken to its core.

In the half-year since, the three-way partnership has moved on. New executives were brought in to restore profitability and navigate through an industry that’s facing disruption from electrification, self-driving vehicles and new business models for transporting people and goods.
Ghosn, 65, is charting a different path, his energy focused on fighting for his freedom, proving his innocence and restoring his reputation. While Ghosn may be tempted to bring the same intensity and energy that he brought as ""Le Cost Killer"" to Nissan, it’s more likely that the pre-trial hearings and trial will be a drawn-out process with little drama.
""The format of argumentation is primarily on paper, not live,"" said Stephen Givens, a professor of law at Sophia University in Tokyo. ""In the U.S., one of the skills that litigators need to have is to be able to think quickly on their feet. There’s very very little of that in Japan.""
Ghosn is facing a total of four charges:
Prosecutors arrested Ghosn multiple times as they handed down the indictments. He was briefly freed on bail, arrested, and then released again, spending a total of 130 days in jail. The former auto executive has consistently denied the charges, describing them as ""biased, taken out of context, twisted in a way to paint a personage of greed and a personage of dictatorship.""
""I hope to be given a fair trial where the truth will come to light and I will be fully vindicated,"" Ghosn said in a statement issued after his second release on bail on April 25.
Junichiro Hironaka
Nissan, which has also been charged on one count for allegedly understating Ghosn’s income, declined to comment on the judicial process.
""The company’s focus is on stabilizing operations and strengthening its management structure, while addressing the weaknesses in governance that enabled this misconduct,"" Nissan spokesman Nicholas Maxfield said.
Read more about Nissan’s struggles to restore profitability.
Thursday’s hearing was for the two breach of trust charges. A hearing for the two charges for financial misconduct will be held June 24, Ghosn's lawyer Junichiro Hironaka said.
The trial probably won’t get underway until Spring 2020, according to Hironaka. Between now and then, there will be several similar pre-trial hearings, mostly likely three or four for each set of indictments. The purpose of the pre-trial hearings, a new procedure enacted in 2005, is to narrow the scope of charges in order to streamline legal proceedings and speed up the trial.
""The pretrial hearing is so important that it can almost decide the outcome, because you have to decide whose testimony the court is going to hear and which piece of evidence the court will examine,"" said Hiroki Sasakura, a professor specializing in criminal procedure at Keio University Law School in Tokyo.
After the pretrial hearing, new evidence cannot be submitted, according to Japan’s code of criminal procedure. Judges can allow new evidence to be presented during the trial at their discretion. The pre-trial hearing process also gives the prosecution and defense an early look into each others’ potential strategy, as they make their case for what evidence to admit.
That process may take a while. Prosecutors have 120 Blu-Ray discs of audio-visual testimony, even as they continue to investigate and gather evidence, the Nikkei newspaper reported this week.
Judges Kenji Shimozu, Kazunori Fukushima and Kenji Matsushita will preside over the proceedings, then issue a verdict. While the trial itself may be even as short as a year, the appeals process could drag out proceedings over several years.
The trial of Japanese internet executive Takafumi Horie on charges of fraudulent accounting lasted five years, including appeals, until he was sentenced to prison in 2011. The former CEO of Livedoor was released in 2013, and has since become an author, social-media maven and rocket industry entrepreneur.
Mark Karpeles, a central figure in the early days of Bitcoin embroiled in the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, was found guilty in March 2019 of tampering with records and given a suspended prison sentence.
Ghosn will be tried alongside Greg Kelly, who ran Nissan’s CEO office and was arrested on Nov. 19, the same day as his former boss. Kelly is facing fewer charges, and Ghosn’s lawyers sought to have him tried separately, a petition that the court denied. Kelly, 62, remains free on bail in Japan.
Two other Nissan executives worked closely with Ghosn and Kelly, but won’t be facing trial. Toshiaki Onuma and Hari Nada struck plea-bargain agreements with prosecutors and cooperated with them before the arrests, according to Hironaka. They provided authorities with a ""substantial amount of statements,"" the attorney said.

Hiroto Saikawa
One question that the defense team says it will ask prosecutors is why Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, Ghosn’s protege-turned-accuser, hasn’t been charged with any crimes. Saikawa signed off on Ghosn’s retirement package, according to an outside corporate-governance panel. Nissan has begun working on a succession plan to identify and promote new top managers, Keiko Ihara, one of the carmaker's three independent directors said in an interview Thursday.
For trials involving multiple charges that result in a guilty verdict, the sentences aren’t added together for each offense. Instead, the maximum prison term is capped at 1 1/2 times the longest possible punishment, according to Sasakura. The maximum fines can be added up. In Ghosn’s case, each of his charges carry a similar maximum sentence of 10 years and a 10 million yen fine."

Imperial Brands Plc dropped to a five-year low on concern that a slowdown in U.S. vape sales and weaker-than-expected tobacco revenue in the first half may push the cigarette maker’s full-year target out of reach.
The shares fell as much as 5.1 percent, the most in four months, to 2,210 pence in London. Second-half sales growth would need to more than double from the first half’s pace for Imperial to meet its full-year target of at least a 4 percent increase, wrote James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
The company is under pressure to boost its vaping business as consumers increasingly switch from cigarettes, the longtime driver of profit growth. Imperial has lost U.S. market share in vaping to upstart Juul, whose high-nicotine vapes catapulted it into the leading player in that market. In addition, Altria Group Inc. is planning to sell IQOS heat-not-burn tobacco products there, tightening the competition.
Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper said Imperial is entering the second half with strong momentum behind Blu electronic-cigarette sales. The company has already implemented most of its price increases in tobacco products, which should add to revenue, she said.
The CEO also said she expects vaping products to contribute to profit in coming years.
“Next-generation products are not that far away in terms of adding to the bottom line,” Cooper said in a phone interview Wednesday. The maker of West cigarettes reported a 1.1 percent increase in first-half earnings per share, driven by its traditional tobacco offerings.
Sales of Blu and other cigarette alternatives more than tripled to 148 million pounds in the first half. The Bristol, England-based company has been pumping investment into such products, spending almost 100 million pounds in the period to advertise and get more smokers to switch.
While vaping growth was strong in Europe and Japan, Imperial flagged a first-half slowdown in the U.S., especially in the first quarter. The tobacco industry is facing uncertainty as it awaits clarity from the Food and Drug Administration on regulation amid calls to raise the minimum age for tobacco purchases to 21 from 18.
Imperial already saw some improvement in vaping sales in the second quarter, Cooper said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
The company plans to slim down its traditional tobacco business to focus more resources on vaping. Imperial said last week it plans to sell its premium cigar business, which includes a joint venture distributing Cohiba cigars from Cuba. The unit could fetch as much as 1.5 billion pounds, according to Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies. That would move Imperial closer to its target of raising 2 billion pounds by 2020 through asset sales.

Originally published by Jack Forster on Hodinkee.
Parmigiani Fleurier has a long history of looking to unusual past masterpieces for inspiration – one of the best known examples is the Pantographe wristwatch, which has an oval case and telescoping hands that mimic the appearance of a pantograph machine (a tracing device that allows one to make a bigger or smaller copy of a drawing or design). The Pantographe is based on a most ingenious oval pocket watch, which was made by the English makers, Vardon and Stedman, around 1800, and which is part of the Sandoz Collection (the Sandoz Family Foundation is Parmigiani Fleurier's parent company). 
Another quite spectacular piece in the Sandoz Collection is a pocket watch made by Perrin Frères, of Neuchâtel, from around the same period as the Vardon and Stedman pocket watch. The Perrin Frères timepiece has a wandering hours complication, in which the minutes are shown in a sector on the front of a watch by a numeral showing the hour, which ""wanders"" across the sector over a 60 minute interval. It's also a repeater, with gongs that have a serpentine shape and which have alternating blue and white stripes, giving them the appearance of snakes. Parmigiani Fleurier has created Toric Capitole wristwatches based on this pocket watch in the past (as unique pieces, although all share the same basic case design and movement) and this year they've released the latest version: the Toric Capitole ""Waves.""
 
This is really watchmaking as art, as was the original pocket watch. There was a period prior to the general adoption of technology necessary for watches to be real precision timekeepers (bimetallic balances, the lever escapement, and mainsprings capable of delivering something like a stable amount of torque across a reasonable power reserve, among other things) during which watchmakers competed with each other in making portable timekeepers of the highest possible amusement value, as to-the-second daily accuracy was something of a crapshoot. As watches became more precise, they also became (in general) less and less ornamental, but there's an undeniable, horological joie de vivre in watches like the Perrin Frères pocket watch and many of its contemporaries, that became something of an endangered species as the age of the precision watch wore on through the mid-to-late 19th century.
The Toric Capitole ""Waves"" is a modern watch technologically, of course, but it's still in the same spirit as the pocket watch on which it's based and like the pocket watch, is a repository of high-craft watchmaking techniques. The dial execution is a new one for the Toric Capitole family of watches, with enamel waves contrasting with the mother-of-pearl minute track, and the double bezel and gracefully downturned lugs combined with the overall flawless finish of the 45mm x 12.1mm case give the watch, interestingly, a more classic feel than the rather baroquely ornate impression given by the pocket watch. 
One of the most breathtaking features of the Toric Capitole ""Waves"" is the movement – this is more or less expected from Parmigiani Fleurier, but the movement has an extra element that makes it stand out, even in the small world of high end minute repeaters (which is a bit of an oxymoron as minute repeaters in general are a high-end affair; the complication seems to have been able to resolutely resist industrialization). The ""Waves"" duplicates the snake-motif gongs found in the original pocket watch – this was done by first resin-coating strips of the gongs, heat-bluing them, and then removing the coating; this leaves the distinctive pattern of blue-and-white stripes that make both the ""Waves"" and the original pocket watch so visually arresting. The gongs are also ""cathedral"" gongs, which make two complete turns around the circumference of the movement, and the resulting deep, rich tones make the ""Waves"" as pleasant aurally as it is rich visually.
High-end watchmaking can be very bombastic, and it can also be technically impressive, and flawless from a craft standpoint, but also rather dull. Doing something original but tasteful in watch design has never been particularly easy and today, it's probably never been easier to make a reliable watch from a purely technical standpoint, or harder to make a really distinctive but coherent design – this is partly due to market pressures, but it's also due to the great inherent challenge that good watch design poses. The Toric Capitole ""Waves"" radiates a certain degree of horological gravitas but its lyricism, plus the unexpected visual charge provided by the snake-motif cathedral gongs, gives it a complex but harmonious character rarely seen from any brand involved in high end complicated watchmaking today.
The Parmigiani Fleurier Toric Capitole ""Waves:"" case, 45mm x 12.1mm, 18k rose gold, sapphire front and back; 30m water resistance. Movement: Parmigiani Fleurier caliber PF321, hand-wound; frequency 18,000 vph; 34mm x 8.5mm with wandering hours. Unique piece, $395,000.

Imperial Brands Plc plans to sell a premium cigar business that includes a joint venture distributing Cohiba cigars from Cuba.
The U.K. tobacco company said it plans to sell the operations to pay down debt and boost investment. The businesses being sold include the Cuban venture as well as Imperial’s own U.S. and international premium cigar units.
The move is part of a plan the company announced last year to raise as much as 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) by 2020 through asset sales, Imperial Brands said Tuesday. So far the company has raised 280 million pounds.
Imperial’s profit has been weighed down by investments in e-cigarettes, in particular to boost its Blu brand. The company is under pressure from rivals with bigger investment budgets and more popular brands.
Under the 50-50 joint venture in Cuba, Imperial distributes and sells cigars under the Cohiba, Romeo y Julieta and Montecristo brands. The sale offers a rare opportunity for another investor to take a business interest in the island nation, which has been isolated by U.S. sanctions for years.
Imperial also has a mass-market lower-end cigar business, and owns the international rights to Davidoff cigarettes, which it sells alongside the Gauloises and West brands.
AZ Capital is advising Imperial on the possible sale.

For the first time, public health officials will ask about Juul by name in an annual youth tobacco survey.
Juul Labs devices have surged in popularity in recent years, coinciding with what health officials have called an epidemic increase in teen vaping.
A language gap is making it harder for U.S. health officials to measure a teen-vaping epidemic.
For some young people who use the popular vaping device sold by Juul Labs Inc., “juuling” is a verb in its own right. Antitobacco groups and health officials worry that has led to confusion when pollsters go out into the field to quiz teens on their nicotine habits for an annual government survey that plays an important role in shaping tobacco policies. This year for the first time, the poll will specifically mention Juul as an example of an e-cigarette.
Caleb Mintz, 17 years old, first tried Juul when he was 15, after he saw his friend holding the sleek device.
“Hearing the word Juul instead of vape makes it sound a lot different,” he said. “It did not look like your typical vape. Giving it a fancy name made it seem like it didn’t have anything harmful in it.”
Mintz didn’t stick with it. He said he saw friends become so addicted that they’d turn to cigarettes for a nicotine fix if their Juul wasn’t in reach. Mintz now considers himself a youth advocate and travels the country with his mother, Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-Cigarettes, calling for e-cigarette curbs.
The National Youth Tobacco Survey is usually compiled each March through May. The updated survey language is expected to capture kids who think juuling isn’t the same as using another e-cigarette.
“We suspect that we may see an increase as a result of the more precise language,” said Brian King, deputy director for research translation in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office of Smoking and Health. “Most kids are aware of Juul now that it has become a household name, but it has also become so ingrained in the culture that some of them may not know it’s an e-cigarette.”
The CDC conducts the survey with the Food and Drug Administration. Results typically aren’t released until late in the year, but preliminary figures may become public sooner. This year the survey will be conducted on electronic tablets rather than with paper and pencil, King said, making it easier to analyze the data.
Youth vaping surged to what government officials last year called epidemic levels. E-cigarette use among high-school students rose 78 percent compared with 2017, to more than 3 million students. Last year, the U.S. survey named brands including Imperial Brands Plc’s Blu and Altria Group Inc.’s MarkTen, which the company has since removed from the market, but not Juul.
Juul Labs made deft use of social media to popularize its device until pressure from the FDA led the San Francisco-based company to shut down its U.S. Facebook and Instagram accounts in November. The company has said it supports efforts to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21.
Juul doesn't prominently refer to its device as an e-cigarette in advertising but does use the word vapor, including in its Twitter handle. While its Instagram account no longer is active, it did often use the hashtag #juulvapor in posts.
Juul spokeswoman Lindsay Andrews said the company makes it clear that its products are intended for adults, and all carry warning labels about nicotine and its addictive properties. “We follow FDA in calling our products e-cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems or vapor across our various forms of communications,” said Andrews.
As “juuling” entered the youth lexicon, the Truth Initiative raised concerns that some users may not know what they’re inhaling. The antitobacco group found 63 percent of Juul users ages 15 to 24 surveyed in November 2018 didn’t know the product contains nicotine, which is considered harmful to developing brains. Some users who knew of the nicotine in Juul pods weren’t aware of the potential downsides.
“I’m someone who’s always been fixated with health,” said Sophia, 22, who runs track for a university. She didn’t want be identified by her full name so her coach and parents wouldn’t know about her Juul habit. Sophia goes through one mint-flavored pod a day, which has the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. She says it hasn’t affected her running.
“It’s seen as something that’s addictive but I don’t know what I’m addicted to,” said Sophia. “It’s been marketed as something not damaging to our health at all.”
E-cigarettes have been hawked as smoking-cessation aids and the FDA took a go-slow approach on regulating them. However, the surge in underage use and the increasing evidence of the devices’ ill effects forced a shift.
“Everybody, including me, previously thought that an e-cigarette is kind of like a cigarette with less junk in it,” said Stanton Glantz, a tobacco researcher at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. But, he said, research is beginning to show that e-cigarettes are “probably about as bad as cigarettes.”
The FDA began to push back last year on the stylized, online-centric marketing by Juul and other companies with messages aimed at preventing youth e-cigarette use. Ads that ran on platforms such as Hulu, Facebook and Spotify warned kids that nicotine could reprogram their brains.
In May, an FDA ad push, part of a larger $60 million prevention campaign, will hit major television networks, said former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb at an event before he left the agency April 5. He said that while the agency had been wary of discouraging adults from using e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking, the youth-use trend “has gotten so worrisome that we’re going to have to now make that trade-off.”
The new ads’ main message will be that teens who vape are more likely to start using cigarettes, Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the FDA, said in an email. Specifics of the media plan, including which networks will air the ads, are still in development, he said.
Still, regulators will need to be agile to track changes in how teens are being introduced to vaping. The CDC’s King said a new e-cigarette called Suorin that comes in shapes including a sleek teardrop device will be added to the survey in 2020. King said Suorin can be refilled with any e-liquid, making it easy to add the marijuana compound THC.

Good afternoon. Here's what you need to know to end your day.
Theresa May just won't give up. She's back in Brussels today to lobby for her proposed one-off, three-month Brexit delay—something her EU counterparts have already said she can't have unless she can persuade Parliament to ratify her divorce deal. The deadlock seems likely to push the endgame into the final hours before next week's deadline.  
With Brexit talks on a knife's edge, the BOE today took the predictable decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.75 percent. The central bank's policy makers indicated they're in no rush to continue with a series of limited and gradual hikes as they wait for more clarity on Britain's future relationship with the EU.
Another setback in finding an Alzheimer's cure. Biogen and Japanese partner Eisai halted a late-stage study of aducanumab, their experimental treatment that had garnered high hopes after rival trials fell short. The bombshell wiped out more than a quarter of Biogen's market value and earned its stock at least nine ratings downgrades. Stifel said it sees no clear growth driver now. Here's more on the disease.
Deutsche Bank is shaking up its wealth management leadership. The head of the European unit slashed the number of regional managers and announced aggressive hiring plans in a bid to jump-start revenue. The lender hired Marco Pagliara from Goldman Sachs to oversee northern and eastern Europe as one of six market heads, down from 14 previously.
Siemens is exploring a combination of its large gas-turbine business with an Asian partner, and has held talks with firms including Mitsubishi Heavy, people familiar said. On the table are a full or partial sale of the division to a joint venture. It's been considering options since at least last June, when Berenberg estimated the business was worth about €3.2 billion.
Wirecard executives in Germany allegedly approved potentially fraudulent transactions totaling €2 million, the Financial Times reported. Last March, four €500,000 payments were transferred from Germany to a Singapore account and were then intended to be sent to Wirecard's Hermes unit in India. Wirecard said the FT's claims are not new and appear to be based on a preliminary report. The outcome of its full investigation will be ""available shortly.""
Italy's banking industry got a rare piece of good news this week, writes Bloomberg Opinion's Ferdinando Giugliano. EU judges ruled that there's nothing illegal about Rome using deposit guarantee funds to prevent lenders from going out of business—a position the European Commission has opposed. However, the Italians shouldn't get carried away. Even if the judgment stands, it will be a Pyrrhic victory.
Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess has many of the qualities needed to manage the German carmaker's pivot to electric vehicles, writes Chris Bryant of Bloomberg Opinion. However, his tactless use of a phrase that evoked a Nazi slogan—""Ebit macht frei""—suggests he lacks at least one key skill that's essential for anyone managing painful change: political and human sensitivity.
The toxic mood surrounding Brexit is starting to infect regulators, too, writes Bloomberg Opinion's Lionel Laurent. The EU financial markets watchdog this week laid out a no-deal Brexit scenario that would, in effect, create a hard border for 6,000 stocks, including 14 listed in the U.K. The result? A chaotic situation that could fracture the world's biggest single market.
Geng Le became an LGBT icon when he left his job as a cop in China to launch Blued, a dating app for gay men. The urge to have a child prompted him to also start an overseas surrogacy service called Bluedbaby. Now he has his eyes on an IPO, ideally in the U.S. The trick will be convincing investors that he can expand his operations in China, where gay people have few legal protections and every new service tests the limits of government tolerance.

Xi Jinping arrives in Italy today, where he will liberally sprinkle investment and talk about China’s commitment to globalization. Then he’ll do the same in France. But his visit is about much more than money.
Europe has reached a point where it needs to work out what it wants from Xi, and where China — with the world’s second-biggest economy and growing strategic heft — fits in the global pecking order.
President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on his allies make it harder for Europe to look to the U.S. as a counterpoint. Even so, the broader question of how Europe navigates between China and the U.S. will remain long after Trump is gone.
As Beijing seeks to expand relations to European companies, governments must manage what’s attached in terms of China’s security interests. Xi, who spoke of his “dear Italian friends” in a paper, listed the sectors China is interested in, and it’s illuminating: telecoms, shipping, aeronautics, aerospace and pharmaceuticals. Europe’s no longer just about ports and roads.
The region largely welcomed China’s investment in infrastructure. Now Europe needs China’s advanced technology and deep pockets. For some nations at least, it is a relationship of uneasy necessity.
Brexit gamble | Theresa May took her Brexit brinkmanship to another level, pushing the European Union to accept a three-month delay and then lashing out at members of Parliament for refusing to back her divorce deal. The standoff is pushing the U.K. to the edge of crashing out of the bloc and into legal and economic limbo. The outrage among lawmakers indicates the prime minister's strategy to pressure them into ratifying the deal may have already backfired.
Liberal dreams | Still angered by Trump's presidential victory despite losing the popular vote, some liberal Democratic candidates in the 2020 race say the U.S. should jettison the electoral college system that gives state delegates the power to choose the winner. While that and other ideas like expanding the Supreme Court stand little chance of success, the debate highlights the ideological and generational divides within the party.
Weapons ban | New Zealand has banned military-style semi-automatics and assault rifles just days after a terrorist attack on two mosques that killed 50 people. The swift move by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stands in sharp contrast with the U.S., where a string of gun massacres has failed to spur political action.
Parting ways | Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban emerged bruised, but not beaten, after Europe's biggest political family froze the membership of his Fidesz party for eroding democratic standards. At home, Orban's pro-government propaganda machine portrayed the suspension as voluntary and a victory over factions that wanted him expelled, rather than humiliation. That gives him the option of either repairing ties or joining forces with like-minded nationalists after May's European Parliament elections.
Isolated kingdom | Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman rode a wave of international enthusiasm for his promises of reform in Saudi Arabia. That all changed after October’s murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and complaints over human rights violations in the Yemen war. With Saudi rulers more isolated in the U.S. than at any time since the Sept. 11 attacks, Glen Carey charts the kingdom's path from the red carpet to pariah.What to Watch
And finally… A former cop in China who created a dating app for gay men called Blued is now helping them to have children using overseas surrogacy services. Geng Le launched Bluedbaby after navigating the surrogacy process to have his son in California. While homosexuality is not illegal in China, offering surrogacy services is a politically complex business. Still, Geng expects the first Bluedbaby birth next month.

Blued’s new service connects men with overseas surrogates. Will China’s government mind?
The urge to have a child hit Geng Le hard after age 35. A former cop from China’s Hebei province, he’d launched a  gay dating app called Blued a couple of years earlier, in 2012, and had become something of an icon for the Chinese LGBT community. Still, he felt his life was somehow incomplete without a child and that he owed it to his parents to sire a new generation.
The next question was how to go about it. A friend had become a parent to triplets via surrogate, but that seemed sketchy because surrogacy is illegal in China. Another option was Thailand, a popular, relatively low-cost option, but by 2015 that country had banned foreign surrogacy. Geng decided on California, which offered the best legal protections for “intended parents” such as himself, excellent advanced medical care for the surrogate and the newborn, and a U.S. passport for the baby. “I thought about how the child, after it was born, might feel a lot of pressure, experience prejudice, feel insecure—‘other people have mothers, I don’t have a mother,’ ” he says. “But he’d have U.S. citizenship, so I could send the kid to study overseas.”
The surrogacy process was a long drumbeat of tests, contract signings, and administrative details. When the due date came around, Geng flew to Los Angeles for the birth and held his son for the first time. “I was just a person, I was used to that,” he says. “After you become a father, you experience this love and this responsibility.” He returned home with his son, Xiao Shu, in March 2017.
He also brought back a new idea for Blued: an overseas surrogacy service for gay men. The app was doing well, on its way to building up 40 million users and more than $130 million in venture capital; he figured many of the people on Blued would be willing to pay if the system could be made easier to navigate. A few months later, he launched Bluedbaby.
The service, part of a larger strategy of diversifying into new business lines for the LGBT community, has seen modest success. Blued has its eyes on an initial public offering—ideally in the U.S., which offers a simpler IPO process and deeper capital markets. The trick for Geng will be convincing investors that he can expand his operations in a country where gay people have few legal protections and where every new service pushes the frontiers of government tolerance and social acceptance.
Not so long ago, Geng was known by his birth name, Ma Baoli, and was married to a woman. But online, he was living a parallel life as Geng Le, creator of an increasingly popular website for gay men. In 2012 local media exposed his offline identity. When his superiors told him he could stay on the police force if he shut down the site, he decided to resign. In a country where stable government jobs are highly prized, the news that he was quitting horrified his parents. Their distress was compounded when they realized he was gay.
His life transformed, Geng decided to double down on his online venture and launch a smartphone app. It was promising enough that, two years after it was released, Shunwei Capital and DCM invested a total of $30 million. At the time, Blued had fewer than 40 employees, no revenue, and no business plan, recalls David Chao, a DCM co-founder and general partner. What it did have was online traffic from a sizable community that, outside of urban centers such as Beijing and Shanghai, remained isolated and hidden. The wager was based on demographics. “We believe that all human beings are alike, so China, with 1.4 billion people, could potentially have 140 million LGBT members,” he says. “Hence you have a large enough community to support an entire economy of its own.”
Chao’s 10 percent estimate might be too high—recent studies suggest that a lower percentage of people are gay—but in a country as populous as China, the market is still well into the tens of millions. Gay consumers are also wealthier consumers, says Eric Huet, a general partner at Ventech China Ltd., which invested in Blued in 2016. He estimates that in China they have five times the spending power of straight people, because they tend to have better jobs and no children (at least for now). And then there’s the international market; Geng estimates that two-fifths of Blued’s 40 million users are overseas. The company doesn’t disclose financial figures, but he says the domestic business has been profitable for the past two years.
A few days before Chinese New Year in February, Geng leads a reporter on a tour of Blued’s headquarters in east Beijing. On the street below, workmen on rickety scaffolding are putting up signs for a Bluedbaby shop front, intended to advertise the service and give clients and staff a place to talk, away from the bustle of the main operation a floor above. The offices upstairs are adorned with rainbow flags, posters from global pride parades, and vivid murals depicting cartoon men (and a few women) wearing lab coats, hard hats, rainbow rocket packs, or mermaid fins. The current meeting room for Bluedbaby clients features a cardboard cutout of two young fathers embracing a burbling baby. Geng waves at a clutch of lawyers who’ve come to discuss IPO plans, his “Just Do It” T-shirt contrasting with their dark suits.
Blued, like other dating apps, uses geolocation to help men find dates and connect with friends. Its most popular and lucrative service allows users to broadcast videos that followers can reward with virtual gifts and money; Blued then takes a cut. The app also brings in money from traditional advertising. In addition to Bluedbaby, the company is trying to get into the pharmaceuticals market by applying for a license to market PrEP, an  HIV-prevention drug regimen. Geng, who’s on PrEP himself, says it’s impossible to get the drug in most Chinese cities, and it’s very expensive when available. The eventual plan is to market and sell it directly to Blued users and to leverage its sales power to negotiate lower prices.
The company’s investors have suggested to Geng that he develop his diversification plans more before taking the company public. He says he hopes to have a $1 billion valuation by the end of the year—an ambitious target, to be sure. “The biggest difference between us and other companies listing is our ideals and beliefs,” he says. “We want to showcase a Chinese company diligently serving the LGBT community, showing that we do things with value, with philanthropy. That’s what I want to do the most.”
There’s some irony for Geng that, as he’s worked to promote Bluedbaby, he hasn’t been living with his son. Xiao Shu is in Geng’s hometown of Qinhuangdao, about 190 miles east of Beijing, being cared for by Geng’s partner and parents. He video chats with Xiao Shu frequently and visits when he can. The air quality and lifestyle are better in Qinhuangdao, Geng says, and his parents are overjoyed to have their grandson with them. He credits his son with helping mend family ties; his mother was so shocked to learn he was gay, he recalls, that she fell seriously ill.
His experience with the surrogacy came to inform Bluedbaby. Hoping to have twins, he’d chosen for the surrogate to be implanted with two embryos. When only one came to term, he regretted not working with a second surrogate, a surer but more expensive bet. Bluedbaby shepherds clients through such choices, connecting them with steps such as choosing an egg donor, finding a surrogate, signing contracts, and navigating American culture. (Among other differences, Chinese custom often dictates that pregnant mothers stay inside and eschew computers, nail polish, and sex.) Three employees in L.A. book hotels, pick up clients at the airport, and help get them around the city. Fees for Bluedbaby can run to thousands of dollars, on top of what clients pay directly to fertility clinics and egg donation and surrogacy agencies. Geng estimates he paid $200,000 to such providers for his own child.
Bluedbaby tries to eliminate some of the uncertainty inherent in the surrogacy process, he says. But there are contingencies no company can claim to prevent, such as miscarriages or stays in a neonatal intensive care unit. And for Chinese would-be parents, there’s the uncertain legal climate back home. Going abroad to have a baby by surrogate isn’t specifically banned, but China  limits the amount each citizen can send offshore each year to $50,000, making transfers to providers difficult.
There’s also risk after the child is born. China maintains an  arcane system of residency permits, or hukou, which determine where children can get public schooling and health care. Parents have no standard process to ensure that babies borne by overseas surrogates get these permits, raising the hugely expensive prospect that, as “foreigners” with a U.S. passport, the children will someday have to attend international schools.
Still, the profit margins and potential demand are promising, and Geng expects Bluedbaby to be making money by the second half of this year. During the interview prior to the Chinese New Year, he describes the holiday period, known as  Spring Festival, as a difficult time for the LGBT community, and an illustration of the need for a service such as his. “If, like me, you’re in your 40s and you still haven’t married, you still don’t have children, how can you face your parents, how can your parents face their friends?” Geng says, describing the holiday stress the LGBT community faces. “The regret is that your life isn’t complete enough. The second regret is that you owe a debt to your parents.”
Bluedbaby wouldn’t make any of the clients it has signed up available for an interview, citing privacy concerns, but other gay men who’ve sought out international surrogates recount similar motivations. One, a 37-year-old marketing specialist for an international company who asked to be identified only by his English name, Russell, worked with a California agency called Los Angeles Surrogacy to arrange an egg donor and a surrogate for the child he’s planning to raise with his partner of five years. Family pressure, he agrees, was a major motivation. “I’m thinking maybe I can just skip the step, skip marriage, just to babies—that’s much easier for me,” he says. He’s already hatching a story about a girlfriend leaving him with the baby.
Russell is exactly the kind of client Bluedbaby is targeting, though he hadn’t heard of the new venture when he started looking around. He expresses surprise on hearing that Blued is openly promoting a surrogacy business. “That’s a very controversial thing,” he says. “Our government is very communist. You don’t know what they’re going to do in the future. Maybe one day they’ll say, ‘OK, we have to stop this. You cannot do surrogate babies in China and you cannot promote it.’ What do you do?”
It’s not illegal to be gay in China, and the days when the police would round up men who met surreptitiously in parks and charge them with “hooliganism” are mostly gone. Homosexuality was removed from an official list of mental disorders in 2001. On the other hand, China has no explicit legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And the government has in recent years broadly suppressed civil society groups, including ones that promote gay rights, according to Darius Longarino, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center.
“Advocates in China don’t think the government is targeting LGBT issues per se,” he says, “but they are wary of any form of organization where people are finding each other and trying to create movements.” A few years ago, for example, one of the biggest apps for China’s lesbian community, Rela, was shut down following an event in Shanghai aimed at raising awareness of gay rights. (It later relaunched.) There’s also been some retrenchment of rules relating to public depictions of homosexuality. In 2016 the government banned portrayals of “abnormal” sexual behavior, including homosexuality, on Chinese television. The next year a government-affiliated group issued similar rules for online content, leading some platforms to  ban anything gay-themed.
Geng’s approach has been to cultivate relationships with officials and work assiduously to align Blued with public-health objectives such as HIV prevention and education. And when controversy has erupted, he’s managed to make his points to officials without drawing their ire. After the online content rules were issued, for example, he didn’t comment publicly, despite  uproar in the gay community. Instead, he reached out to one of the officials responsible, who explained that he’d applied the TV rules without realizing what would happen. Geng framed it as a business issue, and suggested that next time there be opportunity for public comment. In January, when rules were issued for short-video platforms on subjects ranging from criticisms of the Communist Party to foot fetishes, they didn’t single out homosexuality. Geng considers it progress.
Connecting gay men to surrogates is an especially challenging business, he acknowledges. It’s politically complex, high-touch, and slow compared with most e-commerce. Still, it’s coming along. Blued has so far helped a few dozen clients get to the U.S., and Geng anticipates good news within weeks. One of the surrogates is due on April 9. The first Bluedbaby baby is coming soon.

The ministry is weighing the sale of an 8.5 percent stake in Ecopetrol, worth about $3.6 billion. CEO Felipe Bayon said such a sale could take as long as two years to complete, and said the company is generating value for the government, which currently owns 88.5 percent of it.
Felipe Bayon
“I don’t think there’s a need right now to do the sale,” Bayon said Wednesday, in an interview in New York.
The government of President Ivan Duque is struggling to comply with tough fiscal deficit targets at the same time it deals with the costs of a migration crisis from neighboring Venezuela, as well as the expense of implementing programs from the 2016 peace accord with Marxist rebels. Selling part of Ecopetrol would help the government avoid cuts to public investment programs.
At a lunch with investors and analysts in New York last month, Duque said that he didn’t see the need to sell a stake in the company at this stage, according to Bayon. Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla said in an interview with Blu Radio in January that he would support the idea, and that he thought President Ivan Duque also backed it.
The head of Duque’s press office, Carlos Cortes, didn’t reply to an email seeking comment.
Bayon also said he didn’t see the need for a spinoff of Ecopetrol’s pipeline unit, CENIT. The company will generate a lot of value if Colombia’s moves into unconventional production are successful, he said.
“We want to actually increase the volumes from 1.1 to 1.25 million barrels. Ebitda margins are very good, 75 to 80 percent,” he said. “This is a very good piece of the business. Why would you want to sell it?""
Bayon said there was no political pressure on the company to issue a special dividend this year, which was taken due to the company’s strong financial position. The government is “extremely respectful” in its dealings with the company, and didn’t ask the company to take on debt to keep dividends up in 2015, he added.
Ecopetrol is planning to invest between $12 billion and $15 billion in the next three years to boost production, including $500 million for fracking, which is contingent on the government approving licensing.

The first shipments of U.S. humanitarian aid for Venezuela arrived at the country’s western border Thursday, setting the stage for a clash with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, who has pledged to block the supplies.
Two trucks arrived in the Colombian border town of Cucuta, and took the supplies to a warehouse next to an unused bridge that connects the countries. More deliveries are expected soon, though the scale of the need is immense. The supplies will be sent into Venezuela next week, opposition lawmaker Gaby Arellano said in a phone interview.
Colombian police officers escort a truck believed to be transporting humanitarian aid in Cucuta, Colombia on Feb. 7.
Venezuela’s security forces used freight containers and a tanker trailer to cut off the span, and are patrolling the dry riverbed nearby.
Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan National Assembly leader recognized as the country’s rightful leader by more than 30 governments, is using the aid to pressure Maduro’s authoritarian regime and demonstrate his ability to help the masses. But Maduro has said the effort is a pretext for invasion, and there’s no sign that his armed forces will let the shipments through.
A gas tanker and shipping containers block the Tienditas International Bridge in Cucuta, Colombia.
Under Maduro’s failed socialist policies, Venezuela has sunk into a humanitarian crisis, and hunger is common in the once-wealthy petrostate. Children beg for scraps and adults pick through garbage hoping to feed their families.
U.S. sanctions on the oil industry, the government’s only real source of hard currency, threaten further suffering. Those regulations, which were rolled out last week, are part of a two-pronged approach by Guaido and his U.S. backers -- strip Maduro of cash to buy even the small amounts of food he’s been handing out to Venezuelans, and then ride to the rescue with critical supplies of their own.
Nicolas Maduro
The U.S., Canada and European Union have pledged $100 million in aid at Guaido’s behest. That represents only about two weeks of food and medical imports, said Francisco Rodriguez, chief economist at Torino Economics in New York.
Guaido has said supplies will come through Colombia, Brazil and a Caribbean island, but the initial flash point is at the Cucuta bridge. The opposition will find a way to bring aid in, roadblocks or not, said Congresswoman Manuela Bolivar, a member of Guaido’s Popular Will party who is helping coordinate the plan.
“Venezuela is not an island. There are trails, and thousands of kilometers of territory that the aid could enter through, and we’re also looking at maritime options,” she said in an interview. “You have to generate pressure.”
Humanitarian agencies have been wary, because they say relief should be without any agenda. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday that help should arrive without strings.
“When we see the present standoff, it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary,” he said. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives.”
On Thursday morning, hundreds of Venezuelan families flowed over Cucuta’s bridges across the Tachira River.
Some dragged empty suitcases, planning to stock up on staples such as rice and chicken in Cucuta’s supermarkets. Others were leaving Venezuela for good. At the end of the Simon Bolivar Bridge, some get straight onto buses to make the 900-mile trip to Ecuador. Street hawkers offer packets of ibuprofen, acetaminophen and generic Viagra, all difficult to obtain back home.
It isn’t clear how aid deliveries will cross the border in the other direction. While Cucuta has two bridges open to foot traffic, the now-blocked Las Tienditas highway bridge is empty: By the time it was finished, relations between Colombia and Venezuela had deteriorated so much that it isn’t used. The aid shipments seem unlikely to inaugurate traffic.
Juan Guaido
The Red Cross’s Venezuela chapter said this week it is willing to distribute aid but wouldn’t bring food and medicine into the country in defiance of Maduro. Mario Villarroel, the organization’s president, spoke to reporters in Caracas about the group’s “fundamental principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence.”
Cucuta has been swamped by Venezuelan migrants, but Colombia’s National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement that the aid wouldn’t be distributed there.
Meanwhile, time is of the essence. As the U.S. oil sanctions imposed Jan. 28 start to bite, the country will face grave difficulties importing food and the gasoline with which to distribute it, Torino’s Rodriguez said.
Venezuela faces “a very serious risk of famine in the near term,” he said.

While most people in the watch world have been lusting lately after Paul Newman's Paul Newman Daytona, I have been dreaming of a different watch. Don't get me wrong, Paul Newman's Paul Newman is probably  the coolest collectible watch, almost by definition. Paul Newmans after all are a big reason we even have a vintage Rolex market to begin with, but for me there is another watch on the market that speaks to my soul far more than the Daytona. I'm talking about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' Cartier Tank watch. 
Much like Paul Newman's Paul Newman, Jackie's (yes, in my mind we are now on a first name basis) Cartier Tank is not so much about the watch itself, but more about the person and time that it represents. Newman, a ruggedly handsome and salt-of-the-earth kind of guy, wore his Daytona daily and casually, before gifting it to his daughter's boyfriend. He used it for the purpose of telling time, and timing his car races (because that is what watches are actually for). Similarly, Jackie O. likely wore her watch as a means to tell time, for sentimental reasons, and well, because it looked great with her oversized glasses and pillbox hats. 
It is no secret that the Cartier Tank is one of the most elegant watch designs of all time, and is possibly one of the most recognized timepieces – all this making it one of the most iconic timepieces ever produced. In turn, it is also no secret that Jackie O. is one of the most iconic women to ever exist. In fact, some (cough, me) could argue that she is the most iconic woman to ever exist, which makes this watch, her watch, the most iconic ladies' watch ever.  
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (née Bouvier) was born in 1929 in Southampton, New York. She, along with her sister Caroline ""Lee"" Bouvier, grew up in a privileged household, with their parents divorcing in 1940. Jackie, as she was known to friends, graduated from George Washington University (after transferring from Vassar College) and lived and worked in Washington D.C. as a photographer for the Washington Times-Herald. 
It was during this time she met Congressman John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in May 1952. Kennedy later became Senator of Massachusetts that year and proposed to Jackie. They were married in 1953. The Kennedys went on to become an American power couple – JFK became President of the United States in 1961, with Jackie as his First Lady. Jackie was elegant, poised, and well-spoken, despite suffering from personal hardship. And while their marriage may be sometimes portrayed as less than perfect, it was a love story for the books. Sadly, her life took a tragic and unexpected turn with JFK's assassination, on November 22, 1963.
After the assassination, Jackie went on to raise Caroline and John Jr. and re-married – to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968. Throughout the remainder of her life, Jackie was known as a style icon and as one of the chicest women to ever live. Always classic and never trendy, she embodied American glamour and her style remains relevant today. I, for one, have always admired her style, strength, and grace, so you can imagine what a thrill it was for me to hold something that was once hers. 
This Tank was a gift to Jackie from her brother-in-law Prince Stanislaw Radziwill, who was married to her sister Caroline Lee Bouvier at the time. It was given to commemorate a 50-mile walk that the family had completed (Jackie and JFK only participated partially) in Palm Beach. The inscription on the caseback reads ""Stas to Jackie / 23 Feb. 63 / 2:05 AM to 9:35 PM,"" in script. Much like Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" campaign, the 50-Mile Walk was a program initiated by President John F. Kennedy to encourage the American people to get out and exercise. The call to action soon became all the rage and it still continues to this day in parts of the world.
After receiving this watch as a gift, Jackie wore it constantly, and it has been documented in many photographs. In honor of the walk, Jackie painted a small drawing of Stanislaw Radziwill and  Chuck Spalding (a close friend of JFK, who had campaigned for him and who did the whole 50 miles along with Radziwill) – which to me might be the cherry on top of the ice cream sundae.
The watch itself is exactly what I dreamed it would be. Petite and patinated, this Cartier Tank has the familiar glow and nostalgic feel of your grandmother's gold jewelry. It is clear that she wore it often. The case is compact, measuring 20mm wide by 28mm long. The corners have been smoothed down and the cabochon sapphire crown is in the more traditional shape for the Tank, which was unusual for that time period, as Cartier was experimenting with more geometric crown shapes. 
I cannot confirm this, but it is rumored that there were only three of this exact case made. But seeing as there are so many Cartier Tanks from this time period, it is hard to say. What I do know is I could not find this exact example in any reference book, and neither could Christie's – so it is definitely rare.
The dial is a familiar silver with fat, black Roman numerals and blued steel hands. It is signed Cartier France on the dial and on the caseback, along with the case number 44374. While this would usually imply the watch was sold in Paris, it was in fact sold in the New York boutique in 1962, which is further confirmed by the OYP import stamp on the manual-winding movement. As I've already mentioned, the caseback has the inscription, ""Stas to Jackie / 23 Feb. 63 / 2:05 AM to 9:35 PM,"" in what I would assume is Stas' handwriting (Cartier used to do engravings in the purchaser's own handwriting). They used to make shutter watches in the shape of an envelope with the name and home address of the owner in their script on the front (like this one).
However, one of the coolest things about this watch is the fact that it still has Jackie's original lizard strap! As in, the last person this strap touched prior to sale could have been Jackie herself!
Thus it goes without saying that this watch was an incredible thing to hold and to see. It is incredibly rare to come across a timepiece that belonged to someone like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, let alone put it on my wrist (!). The watch and the painting will be up for sale at Christie's on June 21, 2017 in New York. The estimate is $60,000 to 120,000. (Editor’s Note: The watch sold for $379,500.) While this watch may be simpler than Paul Newman's Paul Newman (it is just a vintage Tank after all), it still has that magical connection to an amazing individual that everyone can relate to.

Emmanuel Momoh, the first owner of the Peace Diamond, on a trek to the pit where it was found.
From a pickup truck heading out of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s recent history is legible in the images that scroll beyond the passenger-side window. A hand-painted sign reading “Amputee Lodge” points to a structure serving victims brutalized by an 11-year civil war that ended in 2002. Next comes a billboard that says “Report Bribery,” a plea to resist the corruption blamed for siphoning away international relief funds and obstructing postwar recovery. A faded canvas banner—“Only You Can Stop Ebola”—is a tattered relic from a 2014 outbreak that killed thousands. As we ascend the hills on the city’s periphery, a glance in the rearview mirror reveals a thick brown stripe running down the face of a distant slope: the scar from a 2017 mudslide that devoured the homes of at least 3,000 people, killing more than 1,100 of them.
For a break from all this misfortune and calamity, stop looking out the window and focus on the man in the passenger seat of the truck.
His name is Emmanuel Momoh, and by general consensus, he’s the luckiest man in Sierra Leone. Until last year, Momoh, 44, wasn’t much different from anyone else in a country where more than 60 percent of the population lives on less than $1.25 per day. He cobbled together his living by selling peanut butter to stores in Kono District, a remote and mostly rural region in the country’s east, and by preaching at an outpost of the Deeper Life Bible Church. The village he called home, Koryardu, consists of 47 cinder block and mud houses, and it’s where he’s headed now.
Millions of years ago, volcanic eruptions oozed across the riverine valleys of eastern Sierra Leone, embedding diamonds into the soil. This geological endowment, first identified in 1930, has since generated billions of dollars in international sales. Closer to home, it’s sustained smuggling networks, fueled wars, and wounded the environment, all while bestowing no visible benefits upon Koryardu and other rural villages.
It has also made locals prone to long-shot gambling. If you have a shovel, you have a chance—that’s the mindset. In Koryardu almost all able-bodied residents have spent years digging, washing, and sifting sand and gravel. The World Bank reports that the artisanal mining sector is the country’s second-largest employer, after agriculture, providing work for between 300,000 and 400,000 people. The diamonds they find are usually tiny, better suited to industrial drill bits than wedding rings. Momoh started as an informally employed digger when he was a teenager, and for about a dozen years (minus a couple during the civil war, when he became a refugee in Guinea) he’d wade through muddy mining pools, digging for eight hours every day, usually finding nothing. In 2006, with a bit of money in his pocket from his peanut butter sales, he became a “supporter,” an organizer who hires a small team of diggers to search on his behalf.
Under an arrangement common in Kono, a supporter pays each of the diggers about $2.50 for eight hours of labor, laying claim to whatever they find. If diamonds are unearthed, the supporters take the stones to local gem brokers, who run conductivity tests to verify that they are indeed diamonds. In most cases, the brokers pay for the diamonds on the spot, and off the books. The supporters go home with a fraction of what the diamond will fetch as a polished gem—maybe 10 percent—and generally toss a few dollars to the diggers as a bonus.

Data: Paul Zimnisky, Roy Maconachie

In March 2017, one of the five diggers working for Momoh found a 709-carat rough diamond. To put that in perspective, the average diamond engagement stone in the U.S. weighs about 1 carat, roughly the same as a medium paper clip, and sells for about $6,000, according to industry surveys. This particular rock weighed about the same as a baseball or a D battery. Momoh wrapped it in a piece of white paper, stuffed it in a plastic bag, and recruited five trusted witnesses to accompany him to a local broker for verification. After the stone was tested, it was instantly clear to all present that it was a diamond and worth millions of dollars, maybe tens of millions.
Momoh could have sold it to the broker, in the process pocketing several hundred thousand dollars or so—a fortune by local standards. But he resisted the pressure to hand it over. Instead, he chose to take the diamond to federal mining authorities in Freetown so they could handle the sale. The government had never done such a thing, but Momoh believed that an aboveboard, government-supervised sale would net him a higher return, even after the feds took their share of taxes and fees. Some of those taxes, he believed, could be channeled back to Koryardu, which lacks electricity and running water.
The diamond eventually sold at auction last December in New York for $6.5 million—much less than Momoh initially expected, but more than enough to radically change his life. And that personal tale could have been the sole focus of a story such as this one. It would have plenty of fish-out-of-water scenes of Momoh adjusting to his new circumstances, shopping for houses, opening bank accounts. We’d see him on his first airplane ride, traveling to Belgium to watch experts analyze the stone before it went up for sale. There’d be descriptions of him shivering on the streets of Manhattan the day before the auction, his eyes widening as he walked through the showrooms of Cartier and Tiffany & Co. Maybe there’d be a section centering on his return home, where hundreds of people gathered to welcome the new celebrity. The story of the diamond would, in short, be the story of a humble man who won the lottery.
But Momoh’s jewel has assumed a significance that transcends his own experience. His decision to buck tradition and make an end run around local dealers is being cited as a pioneering prototype—one that might spark a wholesale reformation of Sierra Leone’s artisanal mining trade and help redeem an international diamond industry that has never quite shaken its reputation for ethical compromise and exploitation.
Those broader implications are the reason for Momoh’s trip to Koryardu, where he hopes to convince his neighbors that his model of diamond dealing will finally bring some of the benefits back to them. It could help Sierra Leone rewrite its contemporary history, replacing some of the tragic images with more hopeful signs—new streetlights, new schools, new hospitals. These hopes are palpable. They carry weight. The closer Momoh gets to Koryardu, the harder they press upon him.
The truck bounces across a muddy dirt road and plows through knee-deep standing water. A girl, maybe 10 years old, walks along the roadside, dragging a machete through the dirt while balancing a basket of vegetables on her head. The high elephant grass crowding the sides of the path eventually thins out, and Koryardu emerges. The residents stream out of their homes and converge on Momoh, eager to hear that the diamond’s promised benefits might be on the way.
“Wow, the pressure—unlimited pressure,” Momoh says later, admitting that he was frightened by the swarming intensity of the crowd. “Everyone has their own plan now because of this one diamond.”
Momoh’s stone hit the diamond market at a time of uncertainty, when the industry’s ethics were being attacked from more sides than they’d been in decades. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Sierra Leone’s civil war helped introduce the term “blood diamond” to the world, tarnishing the global trade by linking jewels to illegal arms deals and violent rebel groups. To save itself, the industry—along with the United Nations and civil society groups—created the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which would validate stones that originated from “legitimate sources” and were unsullied by conflict.
Those certificates helped restore consumer trust, but lately some of the same organizations that participated in the process have dismissed them as a failed experiment. The same week Momoh’s diamond was sold in New York, the nongovernmental organization Impact (formerly known as Partnership Africa Canada) became the second Kimberley Process co-founder to withdraw from the certification scheme, saying it had become a source of false confidence for consumers. That came on the heels of a temporary boycott of the Kimberley Process by a wider coalition of civil society groups, and of a mining conference in India at which Martin Rapaport, the founder of an influential diamond pricing index and trading network, delivered a speech concluding that the certifications he, too, had helped establish were simply “bullshit.” At the same time, the  rise of lab-grown diamonds, which are chemically identical to mined stones and free of their ethical and political complications, posed a new threat to traditional diamond businesses.
It was Rapaport who first latched onto Momoh’s diamond as a way to rehabilitate the industry. When Sierra Leone initially tried to auction the stone, it did so in Freetown, which in effect limited the sale mostly to regional buyers. It attracted only five bidders, and the government rejected the top offer, of a little more than $7 million, as less than fair value. The Rapaport Group, which is based in New York and Israel, stepped in and offered to organize, free of charge, a second auction in New York that catered to international buyers.
Rapaport has long been considered an important and disruptive player in the diamond world. For decades, diamonds were assumed to be wholly nonfungible—that is, each stone was unique, and therefore pricing could never be standardized, as it is with traditional commodities such as gold and silver. But in 1978, Rapaport began to publish a weekly list of current diamond prices, sorted according to categories such as size and clarity grading. By injecting a little transparency into a pricing system that had always been mysteriously opaque, he became an enemy to legions of traditional brokers. That enmity didn’t stop his weekly report from becoming the industry’s international pricing bible, and Rapaport’s business eventually expanded to include a diamond-grading service, an auction company that runs 40 events per year, and an online trading platform that lists billions of dollars’ worth of diamonds every day.
In Momoh’s diamond, Rapaport saw a chance to introduce something new and intangible into a stone’s pricing composition: moral value. Before the December auction, he dubbed the stone the Peace Diamond, and he assured potential buyers that Sierra Leone’s government would pour some of its share of the profits back into the village where it had been found. “The idea is that this is a diamond that makes the world a better place,” Rapaport says. “We’re transcending the commodity aspect—which is that it’s a beautiful diamond, and big, and all that stuff—by selling the idea behind the diamond, not just the diamond itself.”
The winning bid of $6.5 million came from Laurence Graff, a billionaire English jeweler. To most observers, it was a sputtering anticlimax, bringing in even less than the bid Sierra Leone had rejected. Dorothée Gizenga, executive director of the Canada-based NGO Diamond Development Initiative, says that Rapaport’s intentions were good, but they were ultimately misguided. “The Peace Diamond didn’t work,” she says.
But Rapaport didn’t let up after the auction. At the American jewelry industry’s largest annual expo and trade show in Las Vegas this summer, he delivered a blistering speech. About 51 percent of the world’s diamonds are sold in the U.S., he said, and an estimated 20 percent of those come from mostly unregulated artisanal miners. Many of those stones—even certified ones—were still being smuggled through black market channels before entering the legitimate market, he added, and were funding terrorism and crime.
“Wait a minute,” he told the audience. “If the diamonds were smuggled, who bought them?” He extended an index finger outward and waggled it. “You did. You did. You did. We did. But we don’t take responsibility for that. We hide in Rodeo Drive.”
Rapaport had recently sent two of his sons to Sierra Leone to visit the villages of Kono and explore with rural diggers and government officials whether a trading scheme based on the Peace Diamond model might be accepted. Instead of trying to sell “some Kimberley Process piece of crap,” he asked his Vegas audience, what if jewelers could assure consumers that proceeds from the diamond they were about to buy would find their way back to the African village where it had been found?
The answer, he later explained, was clear to him: “You could sell the hell out of that!”
Ezi Rapaport, Martin’s 32-year-old son, spent much of early August inside the Radisson Blu Mammy Yoko hotel in Freetown. During the war, the building served as headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, until rebel forces seized it; today it’s the only international chain hotel in the country, which has made it a business hub. Rapaport held court in its patio restaurant. Politicians, entrepreneurs, entertainers, trade officials from the U.S. embassy, NGO directors, Miss Sierra Leone—if they were even mildly influential, he scheduled meetings with them. He’d tell them he was betting on the future of Sierra Leone, repeating a smoothly polished talking point: “We believe the real diamonds of Sierra Leone are the people.”
The Rapaports are Orthodox Jews, and Martin says that institutionalizing the Peace Diamond model in Sierra Leone would be an example of tikkun olam, a kabalistic concept that translates roughly as “repair of the world.” Essentially, it’s the idea that Jews should work to benefit the world at large, not only their own communities. This, and the family’s connection to Israel, is worth mentioning in part because many of the local buyers in Kono who acquire rough stones from diggers—the people the Peace Diamond model would disrupt most directly—are of Lebanese descent. For years, Martin has complained that some of the money entering the black market from West Africa’s artisanal mining trade ends up funding terrorist organizations. Intelligence reports from Western countries and testimony in the trials of al-Qaeda members support this.
The model the Rapaports envision would let diggers and supporters take their stones directly to a countrywide network of auction houses, which the Rapaport Group would help set up. The company generally takes a 5 percent commission for its auctions, according to Ezi; in Sierra Leone, this would be reduced or eliminated. Sales would be regularly scheduled and broadcast online to bidders from around the world. The national government would take a big cut of the sales, as much as 60 percent, leaving 40 percent with the miners (proportions that are technically already on the books for exported diamonds, but are often disregarded, leaving the government with nothing). Additionally, the government would be required by law to spend at least a quarter of its share on projects in the community where the diamond was found. These are the terms Momoh ultimately accepted for the sale of his diamond.
One day, Rapaport left the confines of the Radisson and made the rounds of Freetown’s government buildings, hoping to drum up political support for the plan. Morie Manyeh, the minister of mines and mineral resources, listened with interest as Rapaport outlined the auction idea at his ministry. Manyeh grew up digging for diamonds himself, and he’s convinced that the “resource curse”—the notion that small countries blessed with natural resources end up suffering as a result—is real. He guessed that local miners would embrace the auction idea but pointed out that their relationships with local buyers sometimes spanned decades and extended to informal loans. “The diggers can in difficult times go back to those people and say, ‘You remember I sold my diamonds to you? Well, my son is sick,’ ” he explained. “And they will give them a little something. That does not happen if you go to the government.”
Rapaport next visited Samuel Koroma, the acting director of the National Minerals Agency, which oversees Kimberley Process certifications in Sierra Leone and enforces mining and mineral export regulations. In a steamy office building full of scales and loupes and filing cabinets, Rapaport told Koroma that instead of trying to register, license, and monitor every artisanal digger in Kono, he should instead encourage them to sell directly to the government, as Momoh had. The idea didn’t land well; it was as if he’d told a lifelong drug enforcement officer to turn a blind eye to drug deals as long as the police department was getting a cut.
“Then you’re just making everyone illicit!” Koroma said.
Rapaport placed his hands on the table. “To tell you the truth, that’s not that bad,” he said. “It’s better for the government if nobody has licenses, and everybody pays 40 percent.”
The same day, Rapaport toured the offices of some other parliamentarians, several of whom posed a common question: Why should Sierra Leone listen to the Rapaport Group, whose auction for the Peace Diamond attracted a winning bid that was less than the one the government got and rejected?
“Well, now, that’s a very interesting question,” Rapaport answered. Making a bid wasn’t the same as delivering the payment, he said. That initial bidder had offered only $3.5 million when the diamond was put up for sale in New York. “I’d be surprised if they would have gotten the money,” Rapaport said. It isn’t unusual for local auctions to produce bogus bids. “And where did the money come from? Maybe it’s black market money. Maybe there’s a reason he wants to clean his money. I don’t know.”
But lobbying politicians could take Rapaport only so far. The diggers had to buy into the concept, and for that to happen, they had to see, and not simply be told, that a new method of selling would deliver benefits.
“The people of Koryardu, of the Kono District at large, want to see tangible development,” Saa Emerson Lamina, the chairman of Parliament’s mining committee, said. “Nothing else will satisfy them.”
To get to the mining pits where the diamond was found, Momoh trudges down a steep trail that’s been hacked out of the forest. Rapaport and several dozen villagers follow behind. Momoh brushes past ferns, carefully jumps over an advancing column of biting ants, crosses slick and mossy boulders in a shallow stream, and blindly tromps on a rubbery black centipede shining in the mud. The brisk hike takes about 25 minutes.
A few diggers stand in one of the pits, wading in cloudy brown water and sifting gravel in sluice pans. One of the villagers accompanying Momoh and Rapaport carries a video camera, and another hefts a large speaker, which he places on the pit’s sandy lip. Music starts blasting, and five men begin dancing in a tight group, flashing poses and hand signals before the camera.
“They’re shooting a music video,” Rapaport says. He’d gotten in touch with them during a previous visit to the country and encouraged them to come up with a song that might promote the Peace Diamond idea. He nods toward a man lip-syncing into a dead mic. “They’re the communicators around here—the musicians. They’re an important part of getting the message out.”
The men encourage Rapaport to step into the frame with them. He consents, swaying to the music and gamely testing a few moves while one of the vocalists mugs for the camera and raps: Rapaport family says we are the diamonds.No more blood diamonds!Wanna tell you ’bout the Peace Diamond!We are the diamond!Wanna celebrate the Peace Diamond!Rapaport family, thank you for everything.Rapaport family, thank you for coming to rescue me! 
During a pause in the filming, Rapaport offers some lyrical advice. “You gotta reduce all that ‘Rapaport’ stuff,” he tells the singer. “More about the people! The people!”
The music flares up again, and the performers resume dancing. Rapaport walks over to stand near Momoh, who watches the spectacle without expression. The rappers eventually surround the pastor, trying to coax him into the shot, but he stares straight ahead, his face a mask of determined noncompliance.
Frustration has been slowly building inside Momoh from the moment he arrived in Kono. Every time he visits his village, he’s met by neighbors who are increasingly impatient because the Peace Diamond still hasn’t paid off for them. They were told they’d get new roads, a medical center, a school. Momoh can’t help but feel that they hold him responsible for their disappointment.
The tour of the mining pits complete, Momoh leads the way back to the village, via a clearing where felled tree trunks lie in the dirt. A few workers wearing hard hats and reflective construction vests mill about, one wearing a T-shirt under his vest that says, “Jesus is Coming—Look Busy.” These men are employees of a Chinese company with which the government contracted to deliver the promised infrastructure improvements to Koryardu. Momoh notes that the workers have been clearing the area for months, and they’re still not done. In the dirt near the workers’ feet, there’s an empty foil sachet of Black Commando gin.
“The people are not pleased,” Momoh says.
His frustrations come to a head after a local teacher confronts him, angrily demanding to know what’s going on with the new school building. To find out, Momoh walks toward another would-be construction site. A partial cement-block perimeter wall, a foot or two high, is all he finds. No workers have touched the site for weeks, he’s told.
“It’s as if we’re begging!” he says, his deep voice rising, fraying a little at the edges. “And to be frank, with the money they have for this village, they could demolish the whole village and build it again! The money is there! I have seen all the documents! The money is there!”
Momoh’s patience has dissolved. “Where’s the foundation? This is the only school! There’s no other school besides this! They are taking advantage of the people here because they are just villagers. This is very bad!”
Rapaport tries to calm him, but concedes that the projects must move faster if other local diggers are ever going to follow Momoh’s example. “I’m telling the government that they have to be completely transparent and put up a picture and a sign saying exactly when the projects will be finished,” he says. “And they should buffer it up, manage expectations—allow enough time for them to actually be able to deliver. They can do this.”
That evening, Rapaport ventures into Koidu, a city about 45 minutes from Koryardu where the regional diamond trade is largely based. It’s a riot of raw capitalism, full of low-slung brokerage houses with barred windows and stores selling shovels and sluice pans. In the middle of it all he finds the Kay Marie Lounge, a darkened nightclub with a bright electric sign: THE HEARTBEAT OF KONO.
Inside, a dozen people gather in the sticky gloom of a VIP section. It’s an impromptu meeting of the leaders of the Kono District Miners Union, a syndicate with about 500 members, most of them artisanal diggers. Rapaport talks to them about the importance of ethics and transparency, and they tell him about how the local buyers—“cartels,” they call them—collude to underpay them for their stones. Rapaport outlines his plan to bring Peace Diamond-style auctions to Kono. “Maybe we could get a higher price for you than the cartels you have over here,” he says. They nod receptively. One woman, who says she represents the district’s female diggers, sounds almost desperate for help. “If you had an office here,” she tells him, “we would know we have somewhere to run to. To rescue us.”
When the diggers sell to the local brokers, they’re paid on the spot. If periodic internet-broadcast auctions were established here, the diggers would have to sit on their finds for a while until bids could be placed. “How long could people wait to get the international price?” Rapaport asks the room.
“That’s the thing,” says one of the miners. “We are hungry. We need to eat.” The man consults briefly with the others, and they settle on a time limit: two weeks, maximum.
Rapaport had been thinking a monthly auction would be about right. He tells them, “We have to be positive, we have to be persistent, but we also have to be patient.”
In the months since their company bought the Peace Diamond, the experts at Graff Diamonds have been peering deeply into the stone, noting its colors, charting its mazy imperfections, strategizing how to maximize its value. “As sometimes happens, the rough is extremely hard, so it takes more time and effort to cut,” says Graff, the purchaser. He’s hopeful a polished, premium-quality pear-shaped diamond larger than 100 carats can be extracted, along with numerous other smaller diamonds. The stones will be laser-inscribed, certified by the Gemological Institute of America, then displayed in Graff showrooms and at exhibitions around the world. The potential value that might come from the stone’s community-oriented backstory, Graff says, was one of the reasons he made the winning bid.
After the auction last December, the government promptly paid Momoh his share—about $2.5 million. Momoh paid his five diggers about $130,000 each. He also made similar contributions to Kono’s paramount chieftain and to the village chief, and he’s been paying tithes to his church. That’s left him, after taxes, with about $1 million, he says. So far, Momoh has invested mostly in real estate, buying three houses in three different regions of Sierra Leone. He also bought a plot of land near the house he bought in Freetown, where he has started to build a school.
Momoh and all the diggers he employed now spend most of their time in the capital city, not in the village. If anyone believes this amounts to a betrayal of their community, that person probably has no idea what life is like in Koryardu. “If I want to improve my life,” says Komba Johnbull, the 19-year-old who first spotted the diamond in the gravel, “then I can’t stay in my village. There would have been no way for me to further my education there.”
That might not be the case if the government finishes the village school. The day after he visited Koryardu, Momoh returned to Freetown in his truck and promptly got on the phone with federal mining officials, arguing that the pace of construction had to be addressed. They assured him, and later Rapaport, that the projects were going forward, the money was accounted for, and the government was committed to seeing this through. By late 2018 frustrations over the pace of building spurred the government to suspend the Chinese company’s contract, and it began reviewing the possibility of awarding the project to a different outfit. The Rapaports, for their part, installed solar electricity in a building in the village, with lights and cellphone charging stations for the residents.
Despite his occasional frustrations, Momoh seems the ideal ambassador for the auction project. He exudes self-assurance. He’s polite but doesn’t suffer fools. He speaks about everything that has happened to him in the past year from an impressively wide-angled and practical perspective. The worst thing he could do, he says, would be to blow his money on frivolous extravagances. His dream is to achieve financial self-sustainability through his school project, which would be financed through private tuitions. He could be a walking example of how to respond to good fortune. When he talks about his goals, they are always community-based, and most of them involve funneling benefits back to Koryardu.
There’s one project he dreams about, however, that isn’t strictly practical. In addition to the basic infrastructure projects that the government has started to build in Koryardu, Momoh would love to see something symbolic take shape.
He dreams of a clock tower. A structure of brick and stone that rises above everything else in Kono. Maybe the names of all those who buy Peace Diamond stones—starting with Laurence Graff—could be inscribed into a stone at its base. It would be a monument that everyone would pass every day, for generations.
The government has told him to forget the idea. He’s well aware that reasonable people can argue that Kono needs a lot of things before it needs a clock tower. But he’s not so sure it’s true.
“We need something that we can look at with pride,” he says. “A reminder of good things happening. We need to be reminded of that.”

When money and connections mean you can invest in just about anything, anywhere and over any time frame, what winds up in your portfolio?
Yes, the rich are buffeted by the same forces affecting everyone else: rising rates, trade wars and global populism. But in the rarefied world of ultra-high-net-worth investors, diversification doesn’t mean index funds or assembling a standard stock/bond/cash mix.
With prospects for equities uncertain, Bloomberg canvassed wealthy investors and advisers to find unusual opportunities in 2019 open to those with big fortunes and a taste for the exotic. Following is a sampling of the possibilities.
“The hedge funder’s new Ferrari” is not Italian, fast or even a car, according to financier-turned-art dealer Asher Edelman. It’s a high-octane financial maneuver tied to the sale of artwork that’s part insurance policy, part betting slip.
Offering a guaranteed minimum price to those putting fine art on the block has become standard at top auction houses. Sellers like knowing that works won’t go unsold. In return, if the art sells for more than the guarantee, some of the profit above the prearranged bid goes to the guarantor.
To offload risk, auction houses are negotiating more “irrevocable bids”—also known as “third-party guarantees”—with investors who may see it as a display of financial prowess. With the art market peaking, opportunities abound but carry greater risk and should be approached with caution.
The biggest profit for a guarantor was last year’s auction of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” at Christie’s. Guaranteed to sell for more than $100 million, the painting was hammered at $450 million. Philip Hoffman, founder of the London-based Fine Art Group, estimated that the guarantor made as much as $150 million.
For those on a tighter budget, a Chinese company  plans to finance the purchase of a $75 million Michelangelo painting by issuing 7.5 million restricted shares at $10 a pop. Yulong Eco-Materials Ltd. said it’s offering “the opportunity of its acquired masterpieces to anyone with a brokerage account.”
Some hedge fund managers are content with the “old” kind of Ferrari, as in a real one. But even so, there are Ferraris and then there are Ferraris.
A red 1962 250 GTO owned by technology executive Greg Whitten sold in August for a record $48.4 million. Just 36 were made. (And yes, it reportedly went to auction with a financial guarantee.)
More owners are buying and barely driving supercars because low mileage means a higher price later on, said Ferrari expert and racer Todd Morici. (He calls those cars “garage art.”) Vintage autos as a category returned 288 percent in the past decade, according to the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index, or more than twice that of the S&P 500 Index.

Morici, 62, owns five Ferraris and builds collections for European and Middle Eastern buyers through his Morici Motor Sports LLC. Buying the right car is like buying the right stock, he said: “You can pay more to buy the best, because at the end, it will be worth more.”
Mere money won’t always get you one. Ferrari allows only clients who race in its motorsports program to buy the special edition 488 Pista Piloti. Morici has a Blu Tour De France Pista Piloti on order for $500,000.
In any case, buyers aren’t plunking down piles of cash. The line of credit Morici has with Ferrari enables him to borrow up to 70 percent of the appraised value at what he calls “a friendly rate.”
Weed is so 2018. Next year, cutting-edge investors are going psychedelic.
Those pushing boundaries aren’t wearing tie dye and driving VW buses, but are at work in the lab and treatment room. There’s a renewed wave of research and testing the use of hallucinogenic compounds, primarily psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms,” to alleviate treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and other conditions.
In the U.K., Compass Pathways has produced a synthetic version of psilocybin for a large-scale clinical trial launched in September. The trial is taking place in Europe and North America over the next year or so, with healthy volunteers taking the drug under the supervision of psychiatrists, according to the life sciences company.
“It just feels like a cultural shift going on,” said billionaire Mike Novogratz, who’s an investor in Compass Pathways. “It’s been around for thousands of years; people kind of know its side effects.”
Other backers include German investor Christian Angermayer and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Angermayer’s family office founded Atai Life Sciences AG, which is backing studies of psilocybin to treat depression and has a stake in Compass Pathways.
In the upper echelons of wealth, bespoke products abound, and that includes tailored investments.
A product Citigroup Inc.’s private bank may offer clients in 2019 is tied to the electric vehicle market. The firm’s analysts expect the majority of vehicles to be battery powered by 2030, and that the $22 billion industry will swell to $100 billion by 2025. While the consensus view is that the lithium-ion battery industry has low margins, Citigroup believes “very efficient manufacturers will generate higher profit margins over time,” said David Bailin, the unit’s chief investment officer.
Bailin envisions a security that would track the performance of seven stocks exposed to battery manufacturers and the mining of raw material used in their production. If projected price targets are reached, the portfolio would have a 36 percent average return over the first 12 months, Bailin said.
Buyers will get their initial investment back at maturity, while receiving 70 percent of any performance gains. The fee on a five-year note would be 1.75 percent.
“Clients can choose when to get in but won’t be taking a significant capital risk if the note-writer pays it off at maturity,” Bailin said.
For most entrepreneurs, the business they own or operate is their portfolio. For Steven Millstein, co-founder of Ridgewood, New Jersey-based Stro Cos., that means owning commercial real estate. While Amazon.com Inc.’s dominance has caused countless retail rivals misery, Millstein has seen a more felicitous effect: It has driven up rents for his warehouses.
“For me, the Amazon effect is primarily that 53 percent of sales on their platforms are from third-party sellers,” Millstein said. “Those sellers are often tenants in my buildings.”
Amazon’s decision to open a satellite headquarters in  Long Island City, New York, “was huge for us, and further justification for adding to this asset class,” Millstein said. Stro has about 2 million square feet and 26 buildings in Northern New Jersey and plans to add another in early 2019.
Millstein describes himself as “a generational owner” with no plans to sell. One measure of the return on his investment: “In the last few years, we’ve purchased buildings and within a year to three years were able to get all of our equity out through a refinance,” he said. “We have all of our risk off the table, and we coupon-clip going forward.”
Cryptocurrencies had a  horrid year, but there’s still a play for 2019 with the potential to do well in good and bad markets.
That’s the hope of investors in crypto-tax software startups, including San Francisco’s CoinTracker, Seattle’s ZenLedger and TaxToken. In a world where Bitcoin’s price has tumbled about 80 percent, it’s telling that the next product on ZenLedger’s agenda is a tax-loss-harvesting tool.
Tracking capital gains and losses in crypto can be a nightmare, even for accountants, and the Internal Revenue Service has stepped up its enforcement actions. The agency looked into how many Form 8949s, where taxpayers report dispositions of capital assets, had property descriptions it deemed “likely related to Bitcoin.” The answer: a paltry 800 or 900 annually for the years 2013 through 2015, which is likely understated.
Vestigo Ventures, Castle Island Ventures and Initialized Capital are among the investors who have backed some of the startups.
The wealthy have the luxury of being able to buy what they love, even if the payoff isn’t immediately apparent. For Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder of  Tiger 21, an investment network for the rich, that means bulk estates of photographers, including those connected with iconic images of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley.
Purchases typically run into the millions of dollars and can include cameras, lenses, tripods, thousands of photos, and undeveloped rolls of film and video, along with the potential to license the images. “You need a 20-year plan to think of how you build a world-class photo collection,” Sonnenfeldt said.
One of Sonnenfeldt’s purchases was the estate of Hungarian-American fashion photographer Andre de Dienes, who Sonnenfeldt said “literally discovered Marilyn Monroe” after she was sent to him as a 19-year-old model for a photo series he was shooting of nudes.
Sonnenfeldt got thousands of photos, including many prints of Monroe from age 19 to 24, the intellectual property rights, book rights and negatives. More recently, he bought the bulk estate of Alfred Wertheimer, known for a famous photo of a young Elvis Presley kissing a girl backstage.
“If you go to the licensing convention in Las Vegas, the three most iconic images of the 20th century are Elvis, Marilyn Monroe and Muhammad Ali,” Sonnenfeldt said.

Research shows that reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes by as much as 96 percent would improve public health, Lynn Hull, a pharmacologist at the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, said Thursday in a webcast summary of recent studies on the matter. BAT fell as much as 5.4 percent and Imperial declined as much as 7 percent before paring some losses.
The lecture, preceded by a disclaimer that it doesn’t formally represent the FDA’s position, sparked speculation that tough measures may be on the way. The agency said in March it plans a proposal on nicotine reduction, though analysts say it will take years to implement.
“Making all cigarettes minimally addictive could significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by smoking,” Hull said.
With an estimated 480,000 deaths due to smoking related causes each year in the U.S., FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is developing a plan to change regulation over traditional cigarettes and new alternatives to smoking.
The presentation “demonstrates that the FDA is committed to building a body of evidence to support its nicotine reduction agenda,” Pamela Kaufman, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in note to clients. The next step is for the agency to publish its proposal, she said. Hull declined to comment in her presentation on when that might be.
Hull also summarized findings from a paper the Center for Tobacco Products published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March. Assuming nicotine limits are implemented in 2020, the study forecast the measures would prevent 33 million people from starting to smoke and 8 million deaths by 2100.
The new rules may increase the use of noncombustible nicotine alternatives after they’re implemented, but overall consumption should decline over time, Hull said. Studies also show that a sudden reduction in nicotine levels won’t lead smokers to compensate by smoking more, she added.
Both BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes, and Imperial, which manufactures Winston, erased some of their early declines, with the former down 1.5 percent at noon in London and the latter dropping 4.4 percent.
Altria Group Inc. shares closed 2.9 percent lower Thursday. The FDA webcast took place at noon New York time that day.
Some analysts said the presentation only repeated previous statements and summarized past studies.
“There is really nothing to see here,” wrote Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies, who said that while some concern is understandable, the research doesn’t include any studies with independent data-gathering. The estimates of public health gains by 2100 were published in June, he added.
Cutting nicotine to the levels cited by Hull would require difficult, expensive genetic modification of tobacco plants, Bennett wrote. Still, some companies claim a big reduction is possible, including 22nd Century Group Inc., which is developing strains of tobacco with less nicotine.
Separately, Gottlieb and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar wrote in a Washington Post editorial that e-cigarettes shouldn’t be allowed to become a gateway to        teenage addiction. Imperial Brands makes e-cigarettes in the U.S. under the Blu brand.

Tobacco stocks are rallying the most in a decade following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s announcement that it’s cracking down on e-cigarettes in an effort to combat youth vaping.
Altria Group and British American Tobacco gained the most intraday since 2008, rising as much as 7.7 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. Philip Morris rose the most in more than three years. The agency has asked that the five top-selling national e-cigarette brands submit plans on how they will address youth access and use of their products.
Tobacco investors have grown increasingly concerned that the widespread popularity of e-cigarettes is having a negative impact on the old-school industry, a headwind expected to grow as its products from companies like Juul continue gaining traction with consumers. Big tobacco has yet to find a productive way to meaningfully compete against Juul, making the FDA’s move a positive for the companies, according to Cowen analyst Vivien Azer.
If the ban were to happen, Altria Group is mostly likely to benefit, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in the note today.
“Given the market’s overarching concerns about Juul’s impact on cigarettes, especially Marlboro, we think a potential ’ban’ on Juul would be positive for MO,” Herzog wrote.
Jefferies is also bullish on how the FDA’s actions will affect major tobacco players.
“Anything that slows down Juul market share is a positive and this is what we think we will see in all possible outcomes around the ’60-day’ action,” Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said in reference to the 60-day window the FDA is giving manufacturers to submit their plans.
The five brands the FDA has addressed are: Juul, Vuse, MarkTen XL, blu e-cigs and Logic."
63,CRAY,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-13/uber-s-arch-nemesis-on-driver-pay-sues-before-new-law-even-inked,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-13/uber-s-arch-nemesis-on-driver-pay-sues-before-new-law-even-inked,"September 13, 2019, 5:00 AM EDT",Uber’s Arch Nemesis on Driver Pay Sues Before New Law Even Inked,"It didn’t take long for attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan to deploy a new weapon in her six-year war with Uber Technologies Inc. over driver pay.
Within hours of Uber thumbing its nose at a pending California labor law that could upend its business model, the Boston-based lawyer filed yet another lawsuit against the ride-hailing giant, part of her campaign to make gig-economy businesses pay their workers better.
Until now, Liss-Riordan has had limited success. Uber came out unscathed from a marathon battle she began in 2013, ending this year with a $20 million settlement allowing the company to keep classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.
But this time, Liss-Riordan may have more leverage. This week, California lawmakers approved Assembly Bill 5, which guarantees workers employee status if their duties are in the usual course of a company’s business. The measure may force companies to start paying a minimum wage and overtime, and to provide benefits such as sick leave and health insurance.
Uber’s chief legal officer, Tony West, said Wednesday that the company would carry on the legal fight in defense of its position that drivers are contractors. Uber will continue to argue that its core business is technology, not transportation, meaning that its drivers won’t qualify as employees under the law’s new criteria, he said.
Those combative comments are what prompted Liss-Riordan to take on the company again in court.
“It was somewhat stunning that a company would be so defiant, with a state that has strongly stated that workers need to be protected,” she said Thursday in an interview. “Having dealt with Uber for many years, not surprised in a way, but it was stunning they would say that blatantly.”
All eyes are now on Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat elected last year who was expected to sign the bill into law but on Wednesday was reportedly still open to negotiating with Uber and its rival Lyft Inc. regarding possible exemptions from the legislation.
Liss-Riordan has specialized for 20 years in litigating on behalf of low-wage workers in a variety of industries, from exotic dancers to truckers. She has become the gig economy’s chief antagonist in court, at one point opening an office in California while fighting with Uber, Lyft and other Bay Area-based startups that rely on a casual workforce to keep costs down.

She has also leveraged her status as a labor advocate to get into politics, now campaigning to take on U.S. Senator Ed Markey in the Massachusetts Democratic primary next year.
The case that Liss-Riordan brought against Uber in 2013 posed a threat to the company when she won class-action status to represent as many as 385,000 drivers in California and Massachusetts. That momentum was undone by an appeals court ruling last year that allowed Uber to force the vast majority of those workers into arbitration. That whittled the class down to about 13,600 drivers who were eligible for the $20 million settlement reached in March.
As recently as early May, Uber was facing more than 60,000 complaints filed by drivers in arbitration over their classification as contractors, including many brought by Liss-Riordan’s law firm. Just before the company’s initial public offering, Uber said it had settled “a large majority’ of those claims for between $146 million and $170 million.
Liss-Riordan’s new complaint in San Francisco federal court was filed Wednesday as a class action on behalf of all California drivers. An Uber spokesman on Thursday had no immediate comment on the complaint.
Liss-Riordan said she’s counting on recent court rulings, including one Wednesday from a Philadelphia federal appeals court, to get around Uber’s argument that drivers are barred by their arbitration agreements from suing as a group.
AB 5, if signed by Newsom, would codify a 2018 California Supreme Court legal test for defining when a worker is an employee. Liss-Riordan said her new lawsuit could include hundreds of thousands of drivers going back four years if California judges determine the high court’s ruling applies retroactively.
Whether the new suit will take six years to resolve, like her last one against Uber, she couldn’t say.
“This is why I’m running for the U.S. Senate,” Liss-Riordan said. “People are sleeping in their car. Corporations are trampling on rights and working people need a voice. That’s why I’m running. This needs to be nationwide. That’s why I want to go to Washington.”
The case is McCray v. Uber Technologies Inc., 19-cv-5723, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., a maker of server computers, gave a profit forecast that topped Wall Street estimates, signaling progress on its efforts to cut costs and reshape its business to higher-margin products.
Adjusted earnings, excluding some items, will be 43 cents to 47 cents a share in the period ending in October, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected 43 cents. The company also raised its fiscal year forecast for adjusted earnings to $1.72 to $1.76 a share from its May guidance of $1.62 to $1.72.
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri has sought to prepare the hardware maker for a future increasingly defined by cloud-based software. HPE said in June that it would offer its products as a service, with servers, storage hardware, networking gear and software available through subscriptions or pay-per-use models by 2022.
Neri also formed a partnership with Google to help clients adopt a hybrid model and announced a $1.4 billion acquisition of Cray Inc. to bolster HPE in supercomputers. All the while, the CEO has tried to reduce the company’s spending to make it more profitable, especially with inconsistent sales growth due to weakening demand for servers and storage hardware.
“I would characterize the quarter as strong operational performance in an uneven market, driven by the macroeconomic challenges we’re all facing,” Neri said in an interview. “The trade escalation continues to create uncertainty. Customers take a little bit longer to decide their investment strategy.”
The hardware maker’s operating margin improved by 1.1 percentage points to 10.8% compared with a year earlier, with the biggest gain in the Hybrid IT segment, which includes the company’s servers and storage hardware products.
HPE shares gained about 4% in extended trading after closing at $12.93 in New York. The stock has declined 2.2% this year.
Hardware makers have seen weaker corporate demand for their products, with NetApp Inc.’s disappointing results causing concern for the industry. Analysts expected hardware sales could be hindered by weakening global economies and uncertainty because of the U.S.-China trade war.
HPE’s revenue declined 7% to $7.22 billion in the fiscal third quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $7.28 billion. Revenue fell in most HPE segments in the period ended July 31, with server sales dropping 12% and storage hardware decreasing 5% compared with a year earlier.
“It’s more competitive out there,” Neri said. “The market feels slower than before and we need to navigate through it.”
HPE’s revenue has contracted on a year-over-year basis in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Neri has been trying to reverse that trend by modernizing the company’s products and services with the moves to subscriptions and edge computing, which lets clients process information closer to their source rather than at far-away data centers. Analysts estimate the effort may begin to pay off by the second half of 2020."

He’s also on the boards of HPE and health insurer Anthem Inc.
Since 2015, when HP split into HPE (networking and consulting) and HP Inc. (PCs and printers), Neri has helped define the enterprise business’s scope, leading key acquisitions and the development of advanced servers while shuttering underperforming product lines.
The cloud has to move closer and closer to where the data is being generated. It’s cheaper to move the cloud to where the data is, not the data where the cloud is, so we promised last year, at HPE Discover in Las Vegas, to invest $4 billion to develop that set of road maps and technologies.
There’s no doubt that many of the workloads have moved to the public cloud. But big customers realize it’s cheaper for them to run things on their premises in their data center or in a sort of hybrid model. We believe that’s going to be the world as we go along, and there is a ton of opportunity to modernize that infrastructure and help customers decide what is the right mix.
Well, listen, we’re competing with everybody, you know? We compete on one spectrum with the public cloud vendors, on the other spectrum with the equipment vendors. But we have a clear understanding and strategy. And if you look at our latest results, we’re making significant progress.
The situation we’re in creates uncertainty, and when there is uncertainty, customers tend to step back a little bit. Obviously, there needs to be a fair approach to trade, but we live in a global economy, and the supply chains we’ve put in place over the last few decades are complicated.
More and more intelligence comes through the security analytics that make infrastructure more autonomous. Valuations tend to be a little bit erratic of late, but if it makes sense, we’ll consider it.
No, not at all. We’re focused on executing our strategy and making this company relevant for the future, to become a trusted adviser to our customers. And I have to say, we’re having a ton of fun.
First, you have to have a clear vision for yourself, where you want to be, and establish clear milestones. Second, you have to deliver what you say. Build a network of people who will take an interest in you. And then, taking risk is important. Sometimes you have to move sideways to move upward. • Listen to Bloomberg Businessweek With Carol Massar and Jason Kelly, weekdays at 2 p.m. – 5 p.m. ET on Bloomberg Radio

66,CRAY,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-25/trump-s-latest-china-salvo-betrays-alarm-over-supercomputer-race,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-25/trump-s-latest-china-salvo-betrays-alarm-over-supercomputer-race,"June 24, 2019, 9:30 PM EDT",Trump's Latest China Salvo Betrays Alarm Over Supercomputer Race,"The Trump administration’s latest assault on China is aimed at forestalling advances in super-computing: a sector with profound military and technology implications -- and one where the world’s No. 2 economy poses a credible threat to U.S. dominance.
Washington’s campaign to contain the ascendancy of a potential global rival has expanded beyond telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. to a quintet of Chinese enterprises that embody a nation’s effort to build ever-faster computers. Those ultra-powerful machines, which process calculations on an unimaginable scale, support critical fields from massive data-crunching to artificial intelligence.
On Friday, five Chinese entities joined Huawei on a blacklist that bars them from buying American technology, just days ahead of an important summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Washington raised national security concerns because their computers were developed for military uses or in cooperation with the Chinese military. At the same time, U.S. pressure could have the effect of crimping China’s high-performance computing effort, which has produced some of the world’s fastest machines.
“China’s HPC business development will slow down for sure for both technology and business. However, there are other vendors that will narrow the gap as long as they are not put onto the list,” said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst with Forrester Research.
Among the five was government-backed Sugon, which claims to be the country’s leader in supercomputer sales. It’s one of a coterie of increasingly aggressive supercomputer projects backed by Beijing that are winning credibility in a field pioneered by American names that have fallen on hard times. The storied but money-losing Cray Inc., for example, agreed this year to be acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.
“There’s a broader concern about what China is going to do with supercomputers, particularly when it comes to military applications,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at the Eurasia Group.
Another addition to Washington’s blacklist is Higon, which Commerce identified as a Sugon subsidiary and partners with the U.S. chip maker Advanced Micro Device Inc. in a Chinese joint venture. AMD uses that venture -- Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. -- to license microprocessor technology to clients such as Higon in the world’s biggest PC market. Lisa Su, AMD’s chief executive officer, told a recent conference in Taiwan that AMD would not license newer technologies to Chinese clients. The company said Friday it will comply with the order.
Higon in turn part-owns another two on Trump’s list: Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit and Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology. The fifth entity is the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology, which Commerce said was owned by the People’s Liberation Army’s 56th Research Institute. That agency’s mission was “to support China’s military modernization,” according to Commerce.
Sugon itself is open about working with the Chinese government and hopes to “build a cloud data service network covering hundreds of cities and sectors to provide a wealth of intelligent applications and services for the government, industry and the general population,” according to its website. The U.S. however accused the company on Friday of being “involved in activities determined to be contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.”
“Sugon is pretty small, but it’s symbolic,” said Triolo. “You can argue there’s a clearer national security case with Sugon than with Huawei.”
Taking Sugon out of the equation will hamper but not kill Beijing’s supercomputing endeavors. While the company and its units claim to be the volume leader, there are other outfits considered more advanced technically. They include Inspur Ltd., a computer and cloud services provider with government ties, and a plethora of projects backed by prestigious institutions. Those include an advanced earth ecosystem simulator inside Tsinghua University capable of processing 100 tera-floating-point operations a second.
If “chipset makers in the U.S. stop the supply of product that Sugon has been largely relying on for its high performance computing business, the impact on Sugon’s HPC business will be fatal,” Dai said.

Profit, excluding some items, will be $1.62 a share to $1.72 a share in fiscal 2019, an increase of 6 cents per share from the company’s guidance announced in February. Analysts, on average, projected $1.64.
Shares, which had jumped almost 5% in extended trading on the forecast, gave back all of the gains when executives said on a conference call that the trade war between the U.S. and China had caused uncertainty for the company. The stock closed at $14.34 in New York and has climbed 8.6% this year.
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri is trying to make the company a key hardware vendor for big-data needs, seeking to take advantage of technology trends from artificial intelligence to the internet of things. HPE said last week it would acquire Cray Inc., which makes high-performance computers used to process vast amounts of information, in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. What may prove more consequential is the U.S.-China trade war, which threatens to curb HPE’s revenue and raise some component costs.
Sales fell 4.3% from a year earlier to $7.15 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended April 30, the San Jose, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts projected $7.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted profit was 42 cents a share compared with analysts’ average estimate of 36 cents.
HPE’s sales have contracted on a year-over-year basis every quarter but one since 2017, and Neri has been keen to reverse that trend -- betting $4 billion on edge computing, which lets clients process information on hardware far away from centralized data centers.
The company’s “performance reflects our continued progress on shifting our portfolio to higher-margin products and services, to deliver positive and consistent earnings growth,” Neri said on a conference call with analysts.
The U.S.-China trade war is creating “uncertainty” for the hardware maker, which reported declining revenue from China in the quarter, executives said during the call. HPE generates revenue and profit from a joint venture in China that sells its products, H3C Technologies. Tsinghua Holdings owns 51% of the company. The joint venture underperformed expectations in the quarter, HPE executives said. The company is selling fewer products to H3C, which is offering more China-developed hardware for “profitable growth.”
While HPE has an option to sell its stake in H3C in the next three years, Neri said the company plans to hold on to the investment because it’s strategic and a valuable source of revenue.
“We’re very satisfied with our presence there,” Neri said in an interview. He doesn’t see the Trump administration’s crackdown on companies doing business with China affecting the joint venture because HPE is not sharing intellectual property with H3C, he said.
HPE may have to pay more for some assembly costs as well as minor components that come from China, such as batteries and electronics, said Anand Srinivasan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. HPE builds products for the Asia-Pacific region in China, but also manufactures in the U.S., Mexico and Europe.
The hardware company has had “execution issues” in North America while selling its Aruba networking devices, which include Wi-Fi routers and switches. Aruba product revenue fell 8% in the quarter compared with a year earlier. Neri said the company was reorganizing the way it sold to different tiers of clients, which has delayed some purchases.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. has agreed to buy U.S. supercomputer maker Cray Inc. in a deal valued at about $1.4 billion as the firm works to become more competitive in high-end computing.
Cray investors will get $35 a share in cash, the companies said in a statement on Friday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg report. That represents a premium of about 17% above Thursday’s closing price. The deal values Cray at $1.3 billion net of cash, the firms said in the statement.
Cray jumped 17% to $34.89 at 9:49 a.m. in New York trading after earlier touching $34.96, the biggest intraday gain in a year. Palo Alto-based HP Enterprise gained about 2% to $14.82.
The deal will help HP Enterprise strengthen its position against International Business Machines Corp. It could also become HP Enterprise’s biggest since it started trading in 2015, surpassing its acquisition of Nimble Storage Inc. for about $1 billion more than two years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
HP Enterprise has mostly been paring down since it was created from the breakup of Hewlett-Packard Co. In 2017, it completed a spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corp. It’s also separated some software assets in an $8.8 billion deal with U.K.-based Micro Focus International Plc.
Still, the company has also committed $4 billion through 2022 to initiatives to develop artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and distributed computing offerings. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri, who succeeded Meg Whitman last year, said in November that HP Enterprise would start to see a return on that investment over the next two years.
Loss-making Cray traces its roots back to a company founded in 1972 by Seymour Cray, known as the “father of supercomputing.” This month, it signed a deal with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build a new $600 million system for research on artificial intelligence, weather, subatomic structures, genomics and physics.
HP Enterprise’s own high-end computer systems are used by the University of Notre Dame, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and chemical giant BASF SE, according to its website. Last year, it won a $57 million contract to provide supercomputers to the U.S. Department of Defense for helicopter design and weather forecasting.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is heading straight to the campaign trail Thursday following a morning television appearance where he’s expected to announce that he’s making a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
He is scheduled to appear on ABC’s “Good Morning America” program and then fly to Iowa, where caucuses next February will formally kick off the nomination contest. He’s following that with a trip Saturday to South Carolina, another crucial early voting state.
NBC News reported on Wednesday that de Blasio would declare his bid on Thursday, citing an unnamed campaign spokesperson. Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for de Blasio, declined to comment.
A Facebook post by the Democratic organization in Iowa’s Woodbury County offered a welcome to the new candidate: “Come meet NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray.”
De Blasio, who was first elected mayor in 2013 after serving as the city’s public advocate, becomes the 23rd active candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. His campaign will underscore his advocacy of major investments in education and health care, warnings about income inequality. His high profile as the leader of the largest U.S. city could make his candidacy stand out in a very crowded field of people competing to challenge President Donald Trump in November 2020.
Earlier: De Blasio Targets Trump Buildings in Touting NYC Green New Deal
The race has been re-shaped by the presence of former Vice President Joe Biden, who has emerged as the front-runner since he announced his candidacy on April 25. Yet still more Democratic politicians have entered the contest since then, most recently Montana Governor Steve Bullock earlier this week.
De Blasio’s decision to run reverses a vow made in 2017 during a televised debate as he campaigned for a second term, when he looked straight at the camera and declared: “I will serve for four full years.” He began backtracking from that promise in January, when he told reporters, “the world has changed in the last couple of years.”
The message de Blasio’s presidential campaign intends to sell is a vision of New York as a successful city, with high employment, improved high school graduation rates and low crime.
His six years running City Hall have been a mixture of success and failure.
Both were on display earlier this year when Amazon.com Inc. chose Long Island City in Queens for a second headquarters -- then abruptly withdrew amid a fierce local backlash, chiefly over subsidies that had been offered to the company. The mayor and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a political rival, came under harsh criticism for conducting negotiations in secret, and then failing to salvage the deal.

The de Blasio administration created a universal pre-kindergarten program that now serves 70,000 students, and has embarked on a pre-school plan for 3-year-olds. A two-decade trend of decreasing crime has brought reports of murder and shootings to levels not seen since the 1960s.
And de Blasio and Cuomo earlier this year joined forces to win passage in the state Legislature of a congestion pricing plan that would charge motorists to drive in parts of Manhattan at peak times, and use the revenue to promote mass transit.

Marking the museum’s 50th anniversary, the event drew about 800 guests Thursday to the Park Avenue Armory and raised almost $4 million.
But there was Golden, the museum’s director, on a packed dance floor -- the band was playing Whitney Houston -- giving her full attention to an assistant curator at the Art Institute of Chicago as Citigroup Vice Chairman Ray McGuire and New York City’s first lady, Chirlane McCray, swirled by.

She could afford to ignore them for a moment; somehow she always manages to get to everybody. And anyway, the party was so full of energy and interesting people to talk to, chances were high that a brush with Golden was going to be one of 50 highlights of the night.
There was the juxtaposition of Wall Street types with creatives. Goldman Sachs Chief of Staff John Rogers and former Merrill head Stan O’Neal were seated close to David Adjaye, the architect for Studio Museum’s planned expansion, and DJ Hannah Bronfman.

Key to the gala’s alchemy was having something big to celebrate: the museum’s critical role in advancing black artists. They’ve gained visibility and influence and an appreciation of their responsibility to “combat historic amnesia"" through their work, said artist Sanford Biggers. He’s working on marble sculptures that are hybrids of African and Greco-Roman figures, some of which will be shown at Art Basel Miami Beach.

S&P futures are well off their highs (though still positive) as the other theme from Monday, the Boeing jet crisis, continues to weigh, with Singapore and Australia now joining China and others in placing restrictions on the aircraft.
Airline stocks broadly shrugged off the crisis, with only Southwest (with the highest number of the jet model in question) ending the day in the red. The tape was clearly more concerned with taking last week’s 3.4% breather/consolidation/mini ""correction"" as an excuse to get long early in the week. Analysts in recent weeks had been pointing to a lack of participation among many individual investors in the January rally, and so that dip, and the payrolls overhang removal (maybe even a clearing event?) may have been that excuse to jump in.
Morgan Stanley strategists did caution early Monday that the ""correction"" was likely not over. They wrote one shouldn’t trust the “strong"" rally off ""bad"" fourth quarter results, and that the correction won’t end until pressures on margin stabilize. Mike Wilson has been cautious for a while, and has one of the lowest S&P targets for year-end 2019, so the call for defensives to ""resume leadership"" shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. That being said, the analysts are only referring to the S&P 500 now as just ""modestly"" overvalued. They get ""more interested"" below 2600.
The post earnings season exhaustion is likely setting in, and with the exception of Broadcom, Adobe and Oracle later this week, stock-specific plays become fewer and further between. But today’s action brings opportunities in four names widely followed by the Street (three of them hedge fund hotels): Wells Fargo, in which Warren Buffett holds a sizable stake (>$21 billion as of WFC’s last close) goes before the House of Representatives, while earnings from three relatively recent IPOs (with wildly different performances since their offerings), Stitch Fix, Coupa Software and Switch Inc. are digested.
Wells Fargo shares may come under some additional pressure (no surprise it was the 3rd worst performer in the BKX Monday), with only CMA and NYCB performing worse (they faced their own demons in the form of a weaker than expected slides presentation and a downgrade, respectively) as the megabank will be the subject of hours-long scrutiny from Congressional members of the House of Representatives that will surely look upon the megabank will less favor than the prior Republican-held Congress. The title of the hearing should tell you all you need to know: “Holding Megabanks Accountable: An Examination of Wells Fargo’s Pattern of Consumer Abuses.” More about WFC’s and the upcoming hearing can be found here.
Coupa Software (with 18% of its shares held by hedge fund managers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg) reported post market, and, despite the expected volatility that had been priced in, is looking flat in the pre-market. Analysts from Morgan Stanley noted a beat on billings and margins and that the company deserves its premium, but ultimately the risk/reward is ""balanced.”. The software developer serving the public and private sector will also host an analyst day later today. Needham analysts heading into the print wrote that expectations were ""high"" given its “premium valuation,” and would be buyers on any weakness. Forecasts were a little light for 2020 earnings, but Coupa for the most part exceeded expectations.
To add to confusion today, Stitch Fix (24% held by hedge funds including Bill Miller’s Miller Value and Jackson Square Partners; its also a favorite short seller target), reported post market (not to be confused with and ahead of fellow hedge fund hotel Switch Inc., which reports later today), and blew out expectations for revenue, Ebitda, net revenue forecasts. Piper Jaffray analysts ""remain on the sidelines"" despite the better than expected results, citing the company’s ""muted"" plans to compete in U.K. while the valuation assumes ""above industry terminal EBIT margin."" The high short interest may be responsible for the share movement in the pre-market, with a possible mini squeeze with shares up more than 25%.
And Switch, due later today and boasting 35% of its outstanding shares held by the hedge fund community is in for a ride, with options pricing in an implied move of nearly 14%. BMO analysts earlier in the week wrote that they had been ""disappointed by the lack of revenue visibility"" in the name, but noted the company’s ramping eBay business could offset some of its other sales delays.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise was cut to sell at UBS, which also slashed its price target to a Street-low of $13 as it expects the company’s on-premises hardware sales to face a rising headwind from cloud-computing growth. Increased cloud adoption “will likely grow into a bigger headwind as it moves up from a 20% share,” analyst John Roy wrote. The 15% average selling price growth HPE’s serves saw “is unlikely to repeat,” and “we do not see a 2H19 recovery.” UBS is expecting a revenue decline of 2% in 2019, compared with growth of 7% last year. Shares are down about 2.5% pre-market.
HSBC expects Cola-Cola to go flat, downgrading the stock to hold and dropping its target by $14 to $50. The firm sees “both new and unresolved old problems” as the company transitions to a total beverage model, and is skeptical of how well it can execute the move. “Coke is trying to grow the pie, requiring it to drive revenues but with low-margin brands that may take years to scale up,” analyst Carlos Laboy wrote, adding that KO “can afford to do it only if bottlers go along.” However, “convincing bottlers to believe is getting harder” as the brands with the fastest growth aren’t profitable enough, and “the brands that pay the bills hardly grow.” In addition, HSBC sees new competition from brewers, who are “increasingly integrating beer and soft drinks to compete better,” along with rising sugar taxes and regulation.
Also in the beverage space, BMO Capital Markets cut its view on Monster Beverage to market perform from outperform, seeing “limited upside” to the company’s, ahem, “monster premium.” The current valuation “may be as good as it gets given cloudier growth outlook and dwindling likelihood” of a long-hoped-for buyout by Coca-Cola. Analyst Amit Sharma also sees “modest, if any” gross margin expansion in the U.S due to inflation, a greater contribution from lower-margin products, and the risk that the company may have to promote more in order to protect its volume share. Meanwhile, Red Bull is expanding its price cuts while the energy drink Bang is capturing a lot of the category’s growth, “with MNST being the biggest share donor.”

Source: Bloomberg
Seeking to draw a contrast with Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden said Wednesday that the country is “not electing a planner.”
Warren, who is statistically tied with Biden in recent state and national polls, has released a flurry of policy proposals, a practice that has developed into a campaign slogan: “Warren’s got a plan for that.”
For the most part, Biden has refrained from criticizing his rivals, but his rebuke of Warren may signal a more aggressive approach as he seeks to regain his lead in the polls.
“More important than my plan is my promise: I will get this done,” Biden, who is trying to position himself as a more moderate pragmatist, said Wednesday evening in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Later, he continued, “There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I have.”
Bernie Sanders dismissed criticism that his campaign failed to disclose that he had been diagnosed with a heart attack for three days, and said he “misspoke” when he told reporters he would scale back his campaign schedule.
“That’s nonsense,” the Vermont senator said in a brief video clip of an interview that will air Wednesday evening on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt. “I don’t know what people think campaigns are, you know we’re dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on really.”
When his campaign first divulged that Sanders had been hospitalized and had two stents implanted in Nevada on Oct. 2, it was described as a episode of chest pain. It wasn’t until three days later that the campaign revealed he had suffered a heart attack, though doctors say a blood test would have been conducted immediately to diagnose the heart attack and he likely would have known right away.
NBC also reported that in the interview Sanders walked back comments to reporters outside his Vermont home Monday, when he said he would reduce his campaign schedule and “change the nature of the campaign a bit.”
“I misspoke the other day, I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,” Sanders said. “We’re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.”
He indicated, though, that that wouldn’t happen right away. “I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up,” according to NBC News. -- Laura Litvan
If the 2020 election is decided on the economy, historic trends suggest that President Donald Trump would win by 5 percentage points, according to a new analysis by the economic forecasting firm Oxford Economics.“A record-low unemployment rate, subdued inflation and only moderately cooler income growth will favor the incumbent party despite some party fatigue,” according to the analysis. Trump could even survive a slight downturn, it concludes.
Oxford Economics reached that conclusion based on a model by Ray Fair of Yale University, who has studied the economic factors that best predict presidential elections dating to 1916.
But the analysis carries a big caveat: “Non-economic factors are likely to play an outsized role in this election.” Those factors include the impeachment inquiry announced by House Democrats and Trump’s likability. The model also doesn’t take the Electoral College vote into account. -- Gregory Korte
Joe Biden has a strong foothold in North Carolina, with a double-digit lead over the rest of the Democratic field thanks to overwhelming support from black voters, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released Wednesday.
The finding is good news for Biden, who is either tied with or trailing Elizabeth Warren nationally and in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Among all likely Democratic voters in the state, Biden tops the field with 39%, while Warren had 22%. They were followed by Pete Buttigieg, who had 9%, and Bernie Sanders, who had 6%. While white voters prefer Warren over Biden 31% to 26%, Biden has 63% support among black voters, compared with 3% for Warren.
Biden’s two strongest states are now North and South Carolina, where his black support pushes him into a solid lead.
Still, Warren has room to expand her support from black voters in North Carolina, said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling. She has a 69% favorable rating with 9% seeing her as unfavorable. Biden has an 84% favorable rating with 6% viewing him as unfavorable. -- Emma Kinery
The Human Rights Campaign Foundation will host a town hall at the University of California at Los Angeles devoted to LGBTQ issues on Friday. Candidates scheduled to attend are: Warren Cory Booker, Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Julián Castro and Tom Steyer. Sanders, who has been recovering from a heart attack, also is scheduled to appear, but his campaign hasn’t said whether he still plans to attend.
The fourth Democratic debate is scheduled for Oct. 15th at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. Twelve candidates are slated to take part: Biden, Warren, Sanders, Booker, Buttigieg, Castro, Harris, Klobuchar and O’Rourke, as well as Tulsi Gabbard, Steyer and Andrew Yang.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union will host forums in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidates on Oct. 13. Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, Harris and Michael Bennet have confirmed that they will attend.

Four years later, she’s considering his rival.
“We’re getting to the time that we have to go Conservative,” Khoda said after attending a boisterous all-candidates debate at a community center in Richmond Hill, Ontario, a city just north of Toronto. “The Liberals are going to lose seats.”
Like Ohio in the U.S., the sprawling suburbs around Toronto will likely dictate who will win the Oct. 21 election. After sweeping the diverse, immigrant-rich region four years ago, the Liberals are facing a difficult battle against Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer in the bellwether region known for its 905 area code.
While polls tip Trudeau to win the most seats, his party is riding neck and neck with the Conservatives in the popular vote. If the Liberals sink to a minority government, or lose the election, chances are it will be because Trudeau lost support in this key area over his handling of foreign policy issues such as Iran and China, and the soaring cost of living.
Khoda came to the evening debate seeking answers from Liberal incumbent Majid Jowhari on his position of resuming ties with Iran -- a country she fled 33 years ago -- even though she has made her choice. The Liberals’ views on Iran, and “upsetting” efforts dealing with the U.S. on trade, led her to switch support to Conservative candidate Costas Menegakis.
Others packing the gym suggest a close two-way battle between the Liberals and Conservatives in a riding pollsters say favors the incumbents.
“I think Majid Jowhari has a good chance,” said Mohammad Mahmoudzadeh, 66, chairman of a local construction firm, though he no longer expects the Liberals to win a majority government.

The Richmond Hill riding has about 110,000 people with a median total household income of C$73,563 ($55,245), similar to Ontario’s provincial average. Three out of every five people here are immigrants, of which 72% are from Asia -- led by China, Iran and Hong Kong, according to the country’s statistics agency. Almost two thirds of the population view themselves as “first generation” Canadians.
Richmond Hill is one of 25 ridings in the 905 that includes the cities of Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan and Markham. They’re family-oriented communities whose homeowners carry large mortgages, leaving little left over for spending elsewhere and often commute to Toronto for work, where lack of public transit is a perennial complaint.
“This is a community that’s been really hampered in its growth by the lack of a subway station,” said Karen Mortfield, executive director of the Richmond Hill Board of Trade, which hosted the debate. “That’s a big deal.”
In 2015, the Liberals captured all of Toronto’s 25 ridings and all but three of the suburban districts, helping Trudeau win a majority government with 184 of the 338 seats in Parliament. But the seats often flip. In 2011, Stephen Harper’s Conservatives captured most of the suburbs and parts of Toronto to gain a majority. The two regions together make up 50 seats, accounting for 15% of the entire country.
“Since the early 1960s the suburban belt around Toronto has determined which party comes to power and whether it’s going to be a majority or minority,” Nelson Wiseman, a University of Toronto political science professor who specializes in Canadian politics, said in a phone interview. “And in this election, the Liberals are going to sustain significant losses -- they might lose half of those seats.”

Winning this region involves swinging votes by a couple percentage points and the Liberals are playing defense versus 2015, when Trudeau’s “Sunny Ways” mantra of hope appealed to Canadians wanting change after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Wiseman said. He anticipates lower voter turnout this time, especially among younger Canadians, which favors the Conservatives since they tend to gain the older vote.
The Liberals have 36% support compared to 35% for the Conservatives, while the New Democratic Party is third with 13%, according to a Nanos Research survey published Wednesday by CTV News and the Globe and Mail. Seat projections compiled by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. put Trudeau on track to win in 153 districts, short of the 170 required for a majority. 
At Hillcrest Mall, one of Richmond Hill’s biggest shopping centers, voters were divided. For Soroush Yousefi, 23, voting Conservative is a no-brainer even though he backed Trudeau four years earlier. Scheer’s tax cuts and promises to boost the economy.
“Back then, a lot of the things Trudeau promised seemed better, but since he’s been in power, everything has been going downhill,” said Yousefi, a sales associate, who points to the lofty cost of housing. “Everything just keeps getting more and more expensive and the jobs aren’t paying enough to keep up with your expenses.”
A few stores away, employee Emma Hamilton said she’s probably voting Liberal.
“I’ve been working 40 hours the entire summer each week just to save up for school so my biggest concern is everybody’s stance toward education and I don’t like the direction the Conservatives are going,” Hamilton, 20, said while closing shop after a late weeknight shift. “I feel like Trudeau’s all talk as well, so I’d like to vote NDP, but they never win.”
Noone at the mall or community center took issue with Trudeau’s blackface controversy, photos of him in dark make up as a younger man, released earlier in the campaign.
Even Richmond Hill’s mayor wouldn’t predict the outcome of the federal contest in his backyard during an Oct. 2 phone interview.
“It’ll be very close and it might end up being a party where the two governments have to work together,” Mayor Dave Barrow said.

Source: Bloomberg
Bernie Sanders says he will “change the nature of the campaign” after a heart attack last week, scaling back the number of rallies and appearances in early primary states.
“We were doing, in some cases, five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,” he told reporters outside of his Burlington, Vermont, home after visiting his cardiologist Tuesday. “I don’t think I’m going to do that.”
Sanders also acknowledged that the heart attack would likely raise questions about his age. “Everything that happens every day weighs on how people think about you. You look at the totality of who a candidate is,” he said.
The fifth Democratic presidential debate will be held in Georgia on Nov. 20, the Democratic National Committee said Tuesday.
The forum co-hosted by the Washington Post and MSNBC will have a higher bar to qualify than previous debates. Candidates must have contributions from 165,000 donors, up from the 135,000 threshold for the Oct. 15 debates in Ohio. And the donors must be geographically dispersed, with a minimum of 600 per state in at least 20 states.
There will also be a change in the polling requirements: Candidates can either show 3% support in four qualifying national or single-state polls, or have at least 5% support in two qualifying single-state polls released between Sept. 13 and Nov. 13 in the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.
Eight candidates have already qualified: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang.

Bernie Sanders’s daughter-in-law, Raine Riggs, has died just days after being diagnosed with cancer. She was 46.
Riggs, a neuropsychologist who lived in Pennsylvania, died Saturday, the same day Sanders returned to his home in Vermont to recover from a heart attack. Her obituary, on the web site of Lee & Martin Funeral Home in Burgettstown, said she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer two days before her death.
She met Bernie Sanders’ son Levi while the two worked at an emergency food shelter in Vermont. They had three children, the obituary said. She was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School for several years and also owned Riggs Geriatric Psychology in Windsor, Vermont.

Elizabeth Warren stood by her story that she was forced out of a teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, after the conservative news website Washington Free Beacon disputed her account.
“All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else,” Warren told CBS News in an article published Monday night. “The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job.”
She also defended her account on Twitter on Tuesday, telling her 3.3 million followers she wanted to speak out about her experience because such discrimination “still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.”
At campaign events, Warren cites the event as a key milestone in her life story, saying the principal of a New Jersey public school “showed me the door” after her first year when she was visibly pregnant. The Free Beacon found “minutes” at the time that say Warren was approved by the school board to teach the following year.
Her exit from the job occurred in an era when women were often fired or pushed out of jobs for being pregnant. In 1978, Congress sought to outlaw the practice by passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.
Elizabeth Warren inched ahead of Joe Biden to top the RealClearPolitics polling average of Democratic candidates for the first time on Tuesday.
Warren squeaked past Biden by a mere 0.2% in the aggregate of polls, averaging 26.6% to his 26.4%. The boost was the result of a Quinnipiac Poll where she was on top with 29%, followed by the former vice president with 26%, but still within that poll’s 4.7 percentage-point margin of error.
Warren had long been trading places with Bernie Sanders for second or third place, while Biden enjoyed a comfortable lead. She decisively overtook Sanders in mid-September and has been eroding Biden’s edge since then.

President Donald Trump is feuding with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over who should pay the bill for the police deployment at a campaign rally in the city this week.
The city told the Target Center, where the Oct. 10 rally is scheduled to be held, that it would have to pay the $530,000 security costs, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. The arena, according to the Star Tribune, then allegedly told the Trump campaign that it would have to cover the bill or would not be allowed to hold the rally there.
In response, Trump fired off a tweet accusing Frey of trying to block his visit and calling him a “lightweight.” And Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, issued a statement accusing the mayor of “abusing the power of his office” while the campaign’s lawyers sent the city a lawyer threatening a lawsuit.
Frey responded with a tweet: “Yawn ... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bill, we govern with integrity, and we love our neighbors.”
Parscale later said in a statement that the dispute had been settled and that the campaign “has not agreed to pay any additional funds.” The Trump campaign still owes nine cities at least $841,219 in total for police security for previous rallies, according to a report from the Center for Public Integrity. -- Emma Kinery
Joe Biden unveiled an education plan Tuesday that focuses on making colleges more affordable and strengthening pathways to the middle class that do not require a bachelor’s degree.
The proposal calls for a $750 billion investment in educational opportunities after high school that would be financed, according to the campaign “by eliminating the stepped-up basis loophole and capping the itemized deductions the wealthiest Americans can take to 28%.”
It would provide two years of community college tuition free while also helping students in the two-year institutions with textbook and transportation costs and other expenses.
The plan also includes a $50 billion investment in work force training, doubling the maximum value of Pell grants and increasing the number of students eligible to qualify for the grants. It would also halve payments on undergraduate federal student loans and revamp the public loan service forgiveness program. The proposal also calls for investment in historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, including $18 billion in grants to those schools.
“It’s about our economy because when students like mine get the chance to learn, we’re all better off,” Jill Biden said on a conference call with reporters Monday night. The former vice president’s wife, who still teaches English at Northern Virginia Community College, helped shape the plan.
Many of Biden’s primary rivals, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have rolled out plans for higher education. Warren proposes to cancel 95% of student debt while Sanders says his plan would eliminate all student debt and abolish tuition for public colleges and universities. -- Tyler Pager
The Human Rights Campaign Foundation will host a town hall at the University of California at Los Angeles devoted to LGBTQ issues on Friday. Candidates scheduled to attend are: Warren Cory Booker, Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Julián Castro and Tom Steyer. Sanders, who has been recovering from a heart attack, also is scheduled to appear, but his campaign hasn’t said whether he still plans to attend.
The fourth Democratic debate is scheduled for Oct. 15th at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. Twelve candidates are slated to take part: Biden, Warren, Sanders, Booker, Buttigieg, Castro, Harris, Klobuchar and O’Rourke, as well as Tulsi Gabbard, Steyer and Andrew Yang.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union will host forums in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidates on Oct. 13. Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, Harris and Michael Bennet have confirmed that they will attend.

Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg’s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.
The  victory of the Socialists in Portugal contrasts sharply with the ebbing of center-left parties elsewhere in Europe, be it at the hand of the Greens or the far-right. The challenge for Antonio Costa in his second term will be to deliver the social gains that he promised while maintaining ambitious budget targets amid a slowing economy. Critics say Costa didn’t use the good times to carry out long-needed reforms and prepare the indebted Iberian nation for the next downturn. Growth is already at half the pace it was two years ago. 
Still Talking | U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson  remains defiant about Britain leaving the EU on Oct. 31, but only has  until the end of this week to convince Europe’s leaders he has a realistic proposal in time for their next summit. Wonder where we’re headed? Robert Hutton answers your questions here.
Retirement Blues | Pension funds across Europe are  struggling to generate the returns they need to cover their growing obligations. The industry is now urging the  EU Commission to change the rules, especially since a complex mathematical formula constructed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority is not working as intended. 
Migration Debate | Home affairs ministers will debate the state of play on migration tomorrow as a recent spike in arrivals to Greece is pushing the issue  back to the top of the EU’s agenda. Emma Vickers and Caroline Alexander explain why migration is expected to swell in the years ahead, but also how it benefits economies and can actually  reduce crime rates. 
German Sluggishness | German factory orders and industrial production readings this week will give vital clues on the health of Europe’s biggest economy. The output data for August will provide the pivotal indication on whether gross domestic product declined for the second successive quarter, the official definition of a recession.
Tariff Reaction | Cheeses from France, Italy and the Netherlands, wines, Scotch whisky and Greek canned peaches are just some of the European exports whose prices are set to rise in the U.S. after the Trump administration announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of EU products starting next week.  Here’s how the continent’s producers plan to react. 
Aircraft Probe | Boeing’s ventures with Embraer face a deeper antitrust probe from the EU, as regulators said the transaction threatens to knock out an important rival to the world’s biggest planemakers. The  European Commission is worried the deal would “remove Embraer as the third largest global competitor” to both Boeing and Airbus, which “may therefore result in higher prices and less choice.”
Spanish Polls | Spain’s Socialists would once more be the most voted party in an electoral rerun but would still fall short of a majority, according to an IMOP Insights poll published by El Confidencial. The country is heading to its fourth election in as many years next month, and the survey suggests it may end up in the same stalemate. 
Maltese Mystery | And now to  some spying news. Read  how the strange case of a missing Maltese professor and former campus adviser is now one of multiple threads entangled in the dispute over Donald Trump’s efforts to show he was the victim of foreign meddling in the 2016 election and not the beneficiary of interference by Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
Bulgarian Star | Hot on the heels of Ukraine’s comic-turned-president, another showman wants to take on the political establishment — this time in nearby Bulgaria, the EU’s poorest member-state. Satirical TV host Stanislav Trifonov vows to fight against the “thick line dividing the party aristocracy and the Bulgarian people,” Slav Okov reports from Sofia. 
Breakaway Vote | Kosovo’s opposition parties won an early general election,  signaling a turn away from politicians who rose to prominence as guerrilla fighters against Serbia in the 1990s. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his country was ready to resume talks to normalize relations with whomever forms a new government in Kosovo if  punitive trade tariffs are lifted.
Turkey has been reinforcing army units at the Syrian border, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signaled an  imminent cross-border operation against U.S.-backed Kurdish militants in Syria. The White House said U.S. forces  won’t stand in the way.

Joe Biden declined to say Friday whether he’d vote to convict and remove President Donald Trump from office if he were still in the Senate.
“I am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,” he told reporters in Los Angeles. “I’m a former vice president, I know what occurred in Ukraine, I know what occurred in terms of China, I know what occurred in terms of Russia. This is a president trying to get two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, to decide who he runs against.”
He added: “This guy, like all bullies, is a coward. He does not want to run against me.”
House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry against Trump to determine whether he acted improperly by asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for releasing aid. The president has also called on China to investigate the Bidens for “corruption.” There is no evidence either Biden or his son committed any wrongdoing.
A vote to impeach in the House would have to be followed by a trial in the Senate.
Elizabeth Warren’s campaign fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after investigating allegations of “inappropriate behavior.”
Campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement that over the past two weeks senior leaders of the campaign “received multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior” by McDaniel. The campaign hired outside counsel to conduct an investigation, she added.
“Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,” Orthman said.
The campaign did not specify the nature of the complaints. -- Emma Kinery and Sahil Kapur
Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock raised $2.3 million in the past three months, the smallest third-quarter take disclosed so far by a campaign.
The campaign said he doubled the number of individual contributions and his average online donation was $24. It did not say how many unique contributors he had.
Bullock, the governor of Montana, who has made getting big money out of politics a major theme of his campaign, raised far less than the fundraising leader, Bernie Sanders, who brought in $25.3 million, or author and political novice Marianne Williamson, who took in $3.1 million.
The Bullock campaign said it would apply to the Federal Election Commission for taxpayer-financed matching funds, which would add up to $250 for each contributor’s aggregate donation. In exchange, the campaign will be limited to how much it can spend in the primaries -- set at $48 million in 2016. That application will require approval from the FEC, which doesn’t have a quorum of four commissioners to make decisions.
Bullock currently polls at less than 1% in the RealClearPolitics average. He didn’t qualify for the Democratic debate in September or for the next one, in Ohio on Oct.15. -- Bill Allison
Joe Biden said his son Hunter would join him on the campaign trail, despite attacks from Donald Trump over his business dealings in Ukraine, but equivocated on where or when.
In an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal on Thursday, Biden was asked whether Hunter would campaign with him.
“Yes,” he answered. But when pressed, Biden said that Hunter Biden lives in the West, and that they hadn’t worked out any specifics.
Trump has accused Biden and his son of “corruption” over Hunter’s involvement with a Ukrainian energy company. House Democrats have begun an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Trump acted improperly by asking the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens in exchange for U.S. weapons. There is no evidence either Biden or his son committed any wrongdoing.
Hunter Biden has not made any appearances with his father during the campaign to date. When asked why Hunter would be an asset, he replied: “Because he’s my son,” he said. “He’s a fine young man.” -- Max Berley
Elizabeth Warren reintroduced her Accountable Capitalism Act on Friday, a measure that would require companies to allow employees to select at least 40% of a corporation’s board of directors.
The legislation, introduced with Representative Ben Ray Lujan, Democrat of New Mexico, stands no chance of progress while Republicans control the White House and Senate, and her earlier effort didn’t succeed. It would change the way large corporations operate, in keeping with Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign pitch to regulate business and tackle inequality.
Warren accompanied the announcement with letters to the CEOs of multiple companies -- including Amazon.com Inc., General Motors Co., Walmart Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP PLC, AT&T Inc., Comcast Corp., Cigna Corp., and Union Pacific Corp. -- asking what they intend to do to serve their workers. -- Sahil Kapur
Marianne Williamson raised $3.1 million for her long-shot presidential campaign, roughly doubling the amount she collected in the previous period.
She ended the quarter with $655,276 cash on hand, and has 140,000 unique contributors since starting her campaign, according to a statement released by her campaign manager, Patricia Ewing.
“It’s the American people who decide which candidates have a voice that needs to be heard, not the gatekeepers,” Ewing said.
Williamson failed to meet the fundraising and polling requirements to participate in the debate of Democratic candidates last month and didn’t qualify for the next forum on Oct. 15 in Ohio.
Williamson, who’s polling at less than 1% in the RealClearPolitics average, lags far behind top fundraisers like Bernie Sanders, who brought in $25.3 million, and Pete Buttigieg, who raised $19.1 million. Candidates must officially report third-quarter totals to the Federal Election Commission on Oct. 15. -- Bill Allison
Democratic candidates will attend a presidential forum hosted by the 2 million member Service Employees International Union in Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday. So far, Cory Booker, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Julian Castro are set to attend.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union will host forums in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidates on Oct. 13. Biden, Booker, Harris, and Buttigieg and Michael Bennet have confirmed they will be there.

Subscribe via Pocket Cast or  iTunes.
Helena Morrissey left Legal & General Investment Management amid reports that she was interviewed to take over from Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England.
Morrissey stepped down after close to three years as head of personal investing at the London-based asset manager, according to a company statement on Friday. The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported last month that Morrissey, a prominent Brexit backer, had been sounded out for the BOE’s top job. Carney is due to step down at the end of January.
“I see a changing Britain and have a lot of ideas and other things that I want to achieve,” Morrissey said in the statement. “I am looking forward to the next phase of my career at a time of great change and opportunity.”
The BOE succession is clouded in uncertainty as Brexit consumes the government’s time. The appointment was originally scheduled to be made this autumn, but the Treasury has pushed back the timeline as the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union approaches.
“The process is on track and we will make an appointment in due course,” the Treasury said.
A spokeswoman for Morrissey said she couldn’t comment on the speculation.
Before joining LGIM in 2017, Morrissey was chief executive officer of Newton Investment Management for 15 years. Hers is the second major departure from the asset manager this year, following ex-CEO Mark Zinkula’s exit.
In her role, Morrissey helped launch the Future World GIRL Fund, which favors companies that have achieved higher levels of gender diversity. She will be replaced in the personal-investing role by Honor Solomon, currently head of retail for EMEA, and Emma Douglas, head of defined contribution.

The sale smashed Banksy’s previous auction record of 1.04 million pounds set last year when another of his paintings, “Girl With Balloon,” famously self-destructed. A shredding device installed within the piece was remotely activated after the final bid had been accepted.

Source: Bloomberg
Joe Biden’s campaign said he raised had $15.2 million during the third quarter, putting him behind lower-polling candidates Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.
The announcement came less than an hour after Biden himself disclosed the fundraising total at a private fundraiser in Palo Alto, California.

The Biden campaign said that its average donation was $44 and that 56% of those contributing in the third quarter gave for the first time. The last week of the quarter was Biden’s best for online fundraising since early May when the campaign solicited donations around his kickoff rally in Philadelphia.
“The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond,” said campaign manager Greg Schultz. “Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.”
Biden’s haul puts him behind both Sanders and Buttigieg, who raised $25.3 million and $19.1 million in the last quarter. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million and Elizabeth Warren has yet to announce her third quarter fundraising numbers.
The former vice president spent much of the last week holding private fundraisers, including five last week in Southern California. The reporting period runs from July through September, so the total doesn’t include some of Biden’s fundraising after news broke that President Donald Trump had pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.
President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that he’s preparing for a possible face-off against Elizabeth Warren as the Democratic nominee in the 2020 presidential election.
Calling her “Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren,” Trump reprised a favorite slur for the Massachusetts senator who’s surging in polls of candidates for the Democratic nomination. Trump said he thought his use of the nickname had ruined Warren’s prospects in the Democratic primary, but now sees her as a potential victor over long-time front-runner Joe Biden.
Trump said he likely would aim new attacks at Warren in anticipation of a head-to-head matchup. “Now we’re probably going to have to do it again because I don’t see Sleepy Joe making it,” he said during a speech at The Villages, a retirement community in Florida. “I thought she was gone.”
Most of Trump’s speech was devoted to health care. He promised his elderly audience that Medicare “will never be taken away from you,” and criticized Democratic plans to expand health insurance coverage either by putting all Americans in Medicare or by creating a government-run “public option” plan.
“All the Democrat plans would devastate our health care system,” he said. “The last administration was frankly moderate compared to the maniacs you’re hearing from today. These are maniacs.” -- Alex Wayne
Any of the three leading Democratic candidates for president would beat Vice President Mike Pence in Ohio if he became the 2020 Republican nominee in the event Donald Trump is impeached, according to an Emerson University poll released Thursday.
Joe Biden would beat the vice president, 54% to 46%, and Pence would lose to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both at 51% to 49%.
The Democrats would also defeat Trump. Biden and Sanders both lead in a potential head-to-head match-up, 53% to 47%. Warren is ahead, 52% to 48%.
The Ohio survey is the first Emerson poll on Pence’s prospects at the top of the ticket if Trump is removed from office. The poll used land-line telephones and online surveys, and has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.
Barack Obama carried Ohio in 2008 and 2012. But Trump flipped the state in 2016. Ohio has voted for the winner of the presidential election in every contest since 1964. -- Gregory Korte
Joe Biden is unveiling a $6 million advertising blitz on broadcast and digital platforms in four early nominating states, his campaign announced.
So far, Biden has spent an estimated $600,000, all in the Iowa market. The new campaign, which will also run in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, aims to synchronize Biden’s messaging across broadcast television, social media and other digital channels, including streaming services. The Democrat’s campaign said the ads won’t just be targeted to voters, but were also intended to mobilize his supporters and build his grassroots fundraising base.
“We know that Vice President Biden’s campaign pillars like protecting and building on Obamacare and restoring the soul of the nation are resonating in communities across America,” campaign manager Greg Schultz said. The campaign said earlier ads, highlighting Biden’s themes of fighting for the soul of the nation and protecting access to health care, had been successful, but didn’t say whether it would continue to run those spots or develop new ones for its most recent buy.
Biden has been the front-runner in national polls, but Elizabeth Warren has surged into a virtual tie with him in several recent surveys. Warren has booked $6.6 million worth of air time in early states starting in January 2020, according to data from Advertising Analytics, which tracks spending on political commercials. -- Bill Allison
The White House had thought about taking a swipe at Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All plan -- and then thought again.
The administration recast the title for the health-care executive order President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign Thursday to “Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation’s Seniors” from “Protecting Medicare from Socialist Destruction.”
Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and Trump has tried to brand all his Democratic opponents as socialist radicals. Sanders’ signature plan would eliminate private insurance in favor of a government-run program that offers Medicare, which provides health-care coverage those over 65, to younger Americans.
Trump is to travel to Florida Thursday where he’ll speak about health policy. His remarks will focus on Medicare Advantage, a program in which private insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc. provide benefits in place of the government, administration officials said.
“I don’t know that we did change the name to be honest with you,” Joe Grogan, head of the White House domestic policy council, told reporters Thursday. “We’re protecting the program for our nation’s seniors and protecting it from a socialist vision of the program.” -- Jennifer Jacobs
Snubbing her California colleague in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein is co-hosting a fundraiser for Joe Biden on Thursday in San Francisco.
Feinstein had said she would support Biden even before he entered the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, choosing him over California Senator Kamala Harris, who has been endorsed by many California politicians.

“My candidate would be Joe Biden,” Feinstein told reporters in January. “I watched him as vice president. I’ve seen him operate. I’ve seen him perform and I think he brings a level of experience and seniority, which I think is really important.”
Co-hosting the event are Feinstein’s husband, Richard Blum, and Denise Bauer, who was ambassador to Belgium in the Obama administration. Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992.
Biden will attend multiple fundraisers in the Bay Area on Thursday before heading to Los Angeles to participate in a labor forum on Friday. -- Tyler Pager
Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker on Thursday unveiled a plan that he says would cut childhood poverty by two-thirds through a proposed child tax credit and by bolstering existing welfare programs.
The tax credit would give a $300-a-month “child allowance” to families with “younger kids,” and $250 to families with children up to the age of 18. The credit would be indexed to inflation. Booker, New Jersey’s junior senator and a former mayor of Newark, also proposes to increase the maximum Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit by 30% and reform the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to inflation-adjusted levels -- a 40% increase in funding.
Booker, who is currently polling at 1.4% nationally, has made addressing poverty and preparing children for success a key point of his campaign through ideas like Baby Bonds, which would give every newborn a $1,000 bond that would be placed in a low-risk account managed by the U.S. Treasury. Recipients could get the funds upon turning 18 and use them toward things like college or buying a home.
“In the richest country in the world, we have a moral responsibility to look after each other and make sure that every child living in America has the opportunity to grow and thrive,” Booker said in a statement.
An analysis of the plan by Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy cited by the campaign estimated that it would decrease the childhood poverty rate from 14.8% to 5% -- raising 7.3 million children out of poverty -- and would cost $65 billion a year. -- Emma Kinery
Democratic candidates will attend a presidential forum hosted by the 2 million member Service Employees International Union in Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday. So far, Booker, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Julian Castro are set to attend.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union will host forums in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidates on Oct. 13. Biden, Booker, Harris, and Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bennet have confirmed they will be there.

Zamira Hajiyeva, who was unmasked last year as part of a British crackdown on foreigners linked to overseas corruption, won’t be sent to her home country, Judge Emma Arbuthnot said Thursday at Westminster Magistrates Court. Arbuthnot said that while Hajiyeva gave no explanation for where her money came from, she was worried about the Azerbaijan legal system’s ability to deal with a case that raised political issues.
Hajiyeva, who had no income of her own, attracted attention from British authorities after splashing 16 million pounds ($19.8 million) in funds across Europe, including at London’s Harrods department store. Her husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, the former head of International Bank of Azerbaijan, is serving a 16-year prison sentence in the country for abuse of his office. Even though his annual earnings as a state employee never went beyond $70,000, his wife owned a pair of properties in the upmarket Knightsbridge area in London.
“The combination of a judiciary which is not independent of the executive, lawyers who are punished if they take on cases of interest to the state, the approach of the court and authorities to Mr. Hajiyev’s trial, all lead me to conclude that there is a real risk that Mrs. Hajiyeva, whose case is high-profile and sensitive and not a normal criminal case will suffer a flagrant denial of justice,” the judge said.
The government plans to appeal.
A lawyer for Hajiyeva declined to comment, citing ongoing proceedings. She’s set to fight the anti-corruption order in the Court of Appeal later in the year.
Hajiyeva, who was arrested last year, won’t get a fair trial in Azerbaijan, her attorney Hugo Keith said at hearings earlier in the year. The former Soviet republic under President Ilham Aliyev has seen the legal profession “terrorized,” he said.
Still, the judge said there appeared to be a strong case against Hajiyeva regarding a conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime. “There has been no explanation for the money that she spent,” she said.

Thomas Cook Group Plc filed for compulsory liquidation in the early hours of Monday after last-ditch rescue talks failed. The company that invented the package holiday ceased to operate overnight, with all of its flights and bookings canceled.
Thomas Cook will now be handed over to administrators who will seek to sell what they can to pay off creditors who owed about 1.9 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).
AlixPartners, a global consultancy firm, will oversee the liquidation and KPMG will help manage some Thomas Cook subsidiaries. Shareholders will be completely wiped out, while creditors will recover a fraction of their original investment from proceeds of asset sales. This process can be spread across multiple distributions and take years.
In a report drafted before Thomas Cook filed for liquidation, AlixPartners said bondholders could get back between 2.2% and 6.3%. Lenders may get as much as 16.7% back on a revolving credit facility.
Unlikely. A compulsory liquidation usually means the company ceases trading, according to Emma Shipp, partner at law firm Hewitsons. Rivals may snap up parts of the business, thereby ensuring their survival, but there’s little sign of any potential buyers.
“It may be that certain parts of the business will be bought out in which case the employment contracts of staff working in that area will be transferred with the business but that depends on buyers coming forward very quickly and there seems no indication of that,” she said.
Thomas Cook is the latest European travel company to file for administration or go through liquidation in the past decade. In the airline sector, Air Berlin Plc, Germany’s second-largest carrier, filed for administration in 2017. Iceland’s Wow Air closed down in November after a failed merger with Icelandair, and French airline Aigle Azur will cease business at the end of the month.
Other high profile cases involved Monarch Airlines in October 2017 and more recently, construction company Carillion, which collapsed in 2018.
Thomas Cook liquidation ends months of talks that had led to an agreed $1.1 billion rescue led by Fosun Tourism Group. The plan involved injecting new capital and swapping debt for shares in the company which would have handed majority control of the tourism arm to Fosun. Creditors would have taken over the airline unit. Negotiations collapsed after Thomas Cook was unable to find backers for an additional 200 million pound credit line requested last week by its largest banks. The U.K. government turned down a request for financial help but will have to foot the bill for bringing home more than 150,000 Thomas Cook customers stranded overseas.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the decision to refuse the bailout that he said had been requested, to the tune of 150 million pounds. ”That’s a lot of taxpayers’ money,” he told reporters. ”It sets a moral hazard.”
That repatriation is twice the size of that arranged for customers of Monarch Airlines, a carrier which went insolvent two years ago, which cost about 50 million pounds, the government said.
Thomas Cook’s collapse wipes out shareholders. Its shares were suspended after it entered into liquidation. Through to the close of trading on Friday, the shares had fallen 89% in 2019, the worst-performing stock in the FTSE All-Share in the year-to-date. The company’s euro bonds lost more than two-thirds of their value on Monday to trade and now they will be part of the claims creditor will try to recoup during liquidation.
For hedge funds and other investors who bought credit default swaps insuring exposure to the company’s debt against default, the situation is different. The liquidation is likely to trigger the payout on their holdings, which may amount to as much as $250 million.

Amazon in February pledged to disclose its carbon footprint sometime before the end of the year and said that half of its shipments would be carbon neutral by 2030. The company also continues to invest in clean solar and wind power to offset some of the energy consumption of its logistics network and cloud-computing server farms.
A group of the retail and technology giant’s employees is staging a walkout on Friday, part of a global strike aimed at calling attention to the risks of climate change. Amazon Employees for Climate Justice said on Twitter earlier this month that more than 1,000 employees planned to participate.
The employee group has been pressuring Amazon for almost a year to release a public report detailing how it’s preparing to deal with business disruptions caused by climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels blamed for that warming. A shareholder resolution calling for the same was rejected at Amazon’s annual meeting."

Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Bill de Blasio each spoke for about 20 minutes at a tree-stump podium. Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard were both supposed to attend, but pulled out of the event. Sanders did not attend so he could rest his voice after experiencing hoarseness.
In their speeches, the candidates fired off zingers at President Donald Trump, generating laughs and cheers from the large crowd.
“I’ve faced worse kinds of incoming than a tweet full of typos,” Buttigieg said as he emphasized his military experience and reassured voters he could face off against Trump.
The event, outside Pee Dee Farms General Store, is usually held in the spring of even-numbered years, but given the historically large Democratic field and South Carolina’s importance as an early primary state, it was pushed up to allow voters to hear from candidates before the primary in February.
President Donald Trump could bank more than $15 million for his re-election effort during a two-day fundraising swing through California later this week.
A lunch in the Bay Area on Tuesday is expected to generate at least $3 million, while a pair of events in the Los Angeles area could bring in $8 million and a fundraiser in San Diego could yield $4 million, according to a Republican Party official who requested anonymity to discuss the fundraising totals.
The events, first reported by the Associated Press, will benefit a joint fundraising committee shared between the president’s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee.
The haul should help pad Trump’s already substantial advantage over his Democratic opponents. The president’s campaign committee had more than $56 million in cash on hand as of his last fundraising report filed at the end of June.
Aides say that advantage is why the president can afford to compete in states like New Mexico – where he’s holding a rally on Monday – that Democrats have largely won in recent election years. -- Justin Sink
Bernie Sanders will embark on a swing through half a dozen Iowa counties that flipped to President Donald Trump after backing Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, aiming to show that he can bring those voters back into the Democratic fold.
The Sanders campaign says the candidate will demonstrate he can defeat the incumbent in 2020 in those counties, which it considers key to taking the state and winning the general election.
The “Bernie Beats Trump” tour next week will highlight his progressive plans on health care, eliminating medical debt, boosting public education and other issues. Iowa has 31 counties that flipped from Obama to Trump, more than any other state the nation, the campaign says.
Sanders leads Trump by an average of 7 percentage points in national polls taken between July 7 and Sept. 5, according to RealClearPolitics. Three other leading Democratic presidential contenders also consistently best him. Former Vice President Joe Biden does even better than Sanders, with an edge of 11.5 points in the RCP average. Senator Elizabeth Warren beats Trump by 5.2 points on average and Senator Kamala Harris has a 4.2 point average lead.
Sanders has the support of one in three of the 2020 Democratic donors in the counties across the U.S. that went for Obama in 2012 and for Trump in 2016, Sanders’ campaign said. -- Laura Litvan
The Working Families Party, a key progressive grassroots coalition that backed Bernie Sanders in 2016, endorsed Elizabeth Warren on Monday.
Endorsements from groups like WFP are critical for candidates seeking support from working-class voters and labor unions. Warren was chosen in the first round of voting after a three-month process featuring house parties, debates, discussions and online forums. Sanders came in second.
Elizabeth Warren
“Senator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the WFP. “Our job now is to help Senator Warren build the mass movement that will make her transformational plans a reality.”
Influential unions like the Service Employees International Union and American Federation of Teachers have yet to endorse, but Sanders has received the backing the United Electrical workers in August, and Joe Biden was endorsed by the International Association of Fire Fighters shortly after he announced his candidacy. -- Emma Kinery
Candidate Andrew Yang says he raised $1 million over the weekend following the third Democratic presidential debate, attributing it to the announcement in his opening statement that he would giveaway $1,000 a month for a year to 10 families.
Andrew Yang
Yang, founder of Venture for America, is running on his signature proposal for a universal basic income plan that would offer every American over 18 $1,000 a month. At the Houston debate Thursday, the entrepreneur used his opening statement to announce a “Freedom Dividend,” giving $1,000 a month to 10 families who enter a raffle via his campaign website, which also solicits donations.
The eyebrow-raising use of a debate opening statement to offer cash to voters prompted questions about whether it would run afoul of campaign laws, but Yang said on CNN Sunday that his lawyers have concluded it’s “perfectly legal.”
Yang has been drawing about 3% support in most recent polls. -- Emma Kinery
Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Bill De Blasio will gather around the Galivants Ferry Stump in South Carolina to address voters as part of a local Democratic Party tradition dating back to the 19th century.
Elizabeth Warren gives a major anti-corruption speech Monday evening in New York City’s Washington Square Park.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union will host forums with Democratic presidential candidates on Sept. 29 and Oct. 13. Michael Bennet, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have confirmed they will attend.

Shull, who joined San Jose, California-based TiVo in May, said in an interview he wants to complete a spinoff of the company’s patent portfolio by the first half of 2020. That business, which throws off much of the company’s profit, would also assume the bulk of TiVo’s debt and tax credits. A second business, which will likely retain the TiVo name, will focus on consumers looking to navigate the shifting TV landscape.

TiVo pioneered the DVR and online program guide: In the 2000s people didn’t record shows, they “TiVo-ed” them. But the company lost its way in recent years as rivals such as Roku Inc. and Apple Inc. introduced set-top boxes that were easier for consumers to install and use.
Litigation has been a distraction, too. The company’s patent portfolio, while lucrative, forces it to sue some of its best customers: TV manufacturers and cable-TV providers that have been designing products that mimic TiVo features.
The shares reflect all those troubles. After soaring early in this decade, they have declined for years. The stock traded at $8.20 Tuesday in New York, down almost 13% for 2019.
Between now and the spinoff, Shull plans other steps to put the company in fast-forward.
Later this month, TiVo plans to announce new international customers, and in October it will unveil a new product, TiVo Plus, that better integrates new streaming services with the company’s core TV console. After that, Shull said he’d like to design a more unified interface for the company’s 22 million customers and seek additional sources of revenue other than monthly subscriptions, such as advertising.
Shull has a background in TV technology, including 10 years at Dish Network Corp., where he negotiated contracts with programmers such as Walt Disney Co.
More recently, he served as CEO of the Weather Channel, which may serve as a model for TiVo. That company’s data business and website were sold to IBM Corp. in 2015 for $3 billion, while its cable network was bought by entertainment entrepreneur Byron Allen for $300 million last year.

It was close to 1 a.m. when Boris Johnson’s Conservatives exited the House of Commons, to cries of “shame on you” over the prime minister’s five-week suspension of Parliament.
His “do-or-die” plan to quit the European Union on Oct. 31 has alienated many.  Earlier, he suffered his sixth defeat in as many days, and now he has to somehow conjure a plan B for the mess he — and the U.K. — are in. Another attempt to force an early election before the Brexit deadline was also rejected.
By law and through gritted teeth, he must now negotiate a deal with the EU — or find a way around one. It would be an irony lost on few if his predecessor’s thrice-rejected deal was resuscitated, given a different coat of paint and put to a vote. Would a worn-down Parliament finally cave in?
In another day of drama, Speaker John Bercow announced he’d resign on the Brexit date. Bercow is a divisive figure — a defender of the chamber’s backbenches who has politicized the role of objective arbiter.
To the cheers of the opposition and silence of Johnson’s allies, Bercow warned: “We degrade this parliament at our peril.”
Trade tension | The Chinese Communist Party’s flagship newspaper criticized Peter Navarro, an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, as the two countries prepare for face-to-face trade negotiations. The state-run People’s Daily said Navarro’s repeated accusations of China’s “seven deadly sins” were intended to “throw cold water on international markets” — a reminder of how deteriorating ties left global investors reeling last month.
Follow the leader | Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement lacks a clear leader — a major reason it’s sustained momentum — and Carrie Lam’s government doesn’t know with whom to negotiate. After protesters’ weekend march to the U.S. consulate, she pushed back yesterday against their calls for the passage of U.S. legislation that would require annual assessments of the city’s special trading status and asked them not to damage public property.
  Sanders’s dilemma | Bernie Sanders has a problem: The Democratic presidential candidate is locked in a second-place tie with his progressive rival Elizabeth Warren and isn’t closing in on front-runner Joe Biden for the 2020 party nomination. Unlike 2016, as Laura Litvan and Emma Kinery explain, the race this time offers several center-left choices, and Sanders needs a breakout moment at the candidates’ debate in Houston on Thursday. 
Testing while talking | Hours after saying it was willing to restart talks with the U.S. on its nuclear weapons program, North Korea fired two “short-range projectiles” into its eastern seas. The regime has tested nearly 20 short-range ballistic missiles in recent months, even as a June meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un raised hopes of a return to dialogue.
Philosophic shift | Germany’s worship of fiscal discipline is being challenged by a looming recession and cheap credit. As Birgit Jennen reports, a silent revolution is under way at the country’s Finance Ministry, where a new chief economist is trying to raise awareness that perennially low interest rates may let Europe’s biggest economy heed calls from its peers to loosen its purse strings.
What to Watch
And finally ... Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett could have collectively lost hundreds of billions of dollars in net worth if presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax plan had been in effect and they’d done nothing to avoid it. According to a new paper by French economists who helped her devise the proposed tax, the 15 richest Americans would have seen their net worth decline by more than half to $433.9 billion had the plan been in place since 1982.

When two U.K. power plants shut down almost simultaneously in London’s first major blackout for a decade, it triggered a storm of questions about how to avoid another failure.
As National Grid Plc, the regulator Ofgem and plant operators investigate what happened, last Friday’s failure underlined the need to bolster an electricity grid increasingly fed by intermittent flows from renewables such as wind and solar. One way is by encouraging construction of new storage assets such as hydropower and batteries that can be called upon almost instantly.
“The power outages boost the case for better system flexibility in the U.K.,” said Emma Champion, an analyst at BloombergNEF. “For instance, competitive sources of dispatchable generation, like batteries, can help manage intermittency and unplanned outages.”
The blackout came at a time when the U.K. power industry is facing increased political scrutiny. The opposition Labour Party has promised to re-nationalize some parts of the network if it wins the next election, and the government is concentrating on leaving the European Union, which will upend trade ties and the case for investment in the U.K.
“There’s no point when you’re covered for everything that might go wrong,” said Tim Green, co-director of the Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London. “You’re only covered for the things you foresaw and the things you paid for. There’s no gold-plated solution where no one would ever get a power cut.”
A few minutes of lost power led to massive blackouts 
Source: Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service

The U.K. is convening the Energy Emergencies Committee, a partnership between the government, Ofgem and industry, that will probe the outage. Ofgem has also requested that National Grid provide an “urgent interim report” on the event by Aug. 16.
To improve the power system’s ability to cope with plant failures, the government should change its capacity market, a backup system, by guaranteeing prices for storage assets for 10 to 12 years to help attract institution investors, according to Peter Dickson, a partner at Glennmont Partners, a clean energy investment firm in London.
That would unlock “huge orders of capital” to fund storage projects for renewable energy sources, he said.
On Friday, it was a gas plant and an offshore wind farm that cut out. About 10 years ago there was a similar blackout when a coal plant and nuclear plant shut down in quick succession. Regardless of whether they’re powered by fossil fuels or renewable energies, power plants can fail simultaneously.
National Grid Chief Executive Officer John Pettigrew’s comments on LinkedIn
National Grid Plc dismissed any notion that the intermittency of renewable energy played a role in the power cuts.
“It is a product of low inertia and not the fuel mix delivering the power, it is an electrical engineering issue,” said Erik Nygard, chief executive officer at Limejump Ltd., a virtual power platform owned by Royal Dutch Shell Plc that can be called on to help balance the market in almost real-time. “There are solutions that exist, so it’s just a question of how these solutions are incentivized in the market.”
Orsted A/S, the operator of the Hornsea-1 offshore wind farm, said it is working with the National Grid to understand why the outage happened.
National Grid does have plans in place to pick up the slack when one source goes down, but there may be a limit to what’s practical. The company could pay for enough capacity in case two power stations go out in a few minutes, but that cost would fall to the consumer. And then what if a third goes out?
“It’s not that the grid doesn’t plan for this,” said Tom Edwards, an analyst at Cornwall Insight. “It is possible to essentially never have these things happening but you’d have to ask who’s going to pay for that?”
The price tag might not be too painful. Doubling the current spending on frequency response, which helps balance supply and demand in the grid, would add about 2 pounds ($2.4), or about 0.4%, to an average annual household bill for electricity, analysts at Aurora Energy Research Ltd. wrote in a note Tuesday.

Since the contraceptive pill transformed women’s lives almost 60 years ago, there’s been precious little innovation in birth control for women. Now a company in San Diego claims to be on the verge of something that could advance the field: a gel women can apply an hour before sex, without having to mess with their hormones. “There hasn’t been innovation in this category in decades,” Evofem Biosciences Inc. Chief Executive Officer Saundra Pelletier says. “It’s time that women have the opportunity to have sex on demand, like men have had with condoms for years.”
That’s a powerful message. But look more closely and Evofem’s product, Amphora, is also a case study in why real advances in birth control are so rare. With plenty of consumer interest in an easier-to-manage female contraceptive, you’d think there’d be many more choices. Yet Amphora is a ­little-changed version of an over-the-counter lubricant cleared for sale more than a decade ago.
The reason there aren’t more and better options for women is simple: money. In the era of $20 billion blockbusters such as the arthritis drug Humira and $2 million-a-patient gene therapies to treat rare diseases, the pharmaceutical industry doesn’t see a big payoff in rolling out products﻿ that don’t have record-breaking potential. Bayer AG’s Yaz family of medicines, one of the best-selling lines of birth control pills, ­generated about $1.4 billion in revenue at its sales peak. Evofem estimates its birth control gel could top out at just under $1 billion in annual U.S. sales. “Pharmaceutical companies don’t really see the benefit,” says Emma Gargus, who leads ­contra­ceptive projects at Northwestern University’s Woodruff research lab.

That argument means little to the many women who are ready for improved contraceptive choices. Those on the market today may be complicated to use, and they can hijack hormones, leaving some users with headaches, bloating, or depression. Although the pill is tried and true, it comes with its own baggage, including an increased risk of high blood pressure and blood clots. Long-term options such as intrauterine devices can have side effects—not the least of which is heavy bleeding every month. “Women today are basically using the same birth control methods for the most part that our grandmothers did,” says Nomi Fuchs-Montgomery, deputy director of the family planning program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “If we don’t galvanize the field and nothing changes, this will be true for our daughters and sons as well.”
The industry funnels only 2% of annual revenue from contraceptives back into research and development, according to the Gates Foundation. That works out to about $100 million, less than a sixth of what a company might spend to bring a single cancer drug to market. Even though the government often backs patient trials—the most expensive and riskiest part of bringing a treatment to patients—for birth control medicines, the progress is still slow.
Diana Blithe, who heads the National Institutes of Health’s contraceptive development program, contrasts the plodding advance of an innovative contraceptive with the pace of testing a tumor drug. A cancer trial can enlist a very small number of people and usually needs to show a single key result: that patients don’t die as quickly. Side effects are less of a concern. A contraceptive, on the other hand, must be safe for vast numbers of healthy individuals, a far higher hurdle. Women seeking a birth control method “have other options,” Blithe says. “Their lives are not generally at risk.”
That safety hurdle has made the ­contraceptives industry a target for waves of lawsuits starting back in the 1970s, when drugmaker A.H. Robins pulled its Dalkon Shield intrauterine device from the market after 2.5 million women had used it. Robins eventually filed for bankruptcy. Bayer faced more than 11,000 Yaz-related lawsuits over risks including blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes. Over the past three years, the courts dismissed two multidistrict litigation cases involving an IUD known as Mirena for lack of evidence. Bayer says it remains committed to the IUD market and is investigating ­nonhormonal approaches and smaller devices.
Still, the litigious landscape has resulted in few companies being willing to push forward with a new product, says Régine Sitruk-Ware, a scientist at the Population Council’s Center for Biomedical Research. That leaves the job mostly to academics and nonprofits.
The Population Council, which conducts medical research, developed Annovera, a vaginal ring that lasts longer than others and won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval last summer. A year later, the device still hasn’t reached potential clients. TherapeuticsMD Inc., which licensed the ring, expects a full introduction next year, when it’s had time to build its manufacturing processes.
The Gates Foundation plans to boost its contraceptives spending to as much as $56 million a year by 2021—more than double its investment of $26.4 million in 2015. Spurred in part by that funding, some academic labs are looking to make more than incremental improvements. Researchers at Northwestern, for example, are exploring gene networks to find ways to control ovulation and perhaps also maintain fertility, Gargus says. But such measures are at best years off.
The road to market for Amphora, the Evofem gel, shows how long and winding it can be for contraceptives.﻿ About 20 years ago, Rush University’s labs in Chicago developed a version of the gel at a time of surging interest in products that could tackle both birth control and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. Amphora works by keeping vaginal pH, which usually spikes in the presence of semen, artificially low to create an inhospitable environment for sperm. The approach dates back to ancient Egypt, where a sticky paste made with acacia and honey may have acted as a crude contraceptive.
Spermicide gels failed to halt the spread of HIV, though, and most drug developers gave up, recalls NIH’s Blithe, who was involved in early studies of some of the products. That left Amphora as “the last gel standing,” Evofem’s Pelletier says. Evofem—then called Instead Inc.—got FDA clearance in 2004 to market the gel as a vaginal lubricant, arguing that it was basically the same as two products already on the market. But the lubricant was never sold.
Now, Evofem is basing its business model on getting the gel—with the same recipe as the 2004 version, but what it says are better versions of some of the ingredients—approved as a prescription medicine. The company says it’s aiming for a list price similar to that of branded contraceptive pills, about $140 to $170 a month.
Still, U.S. regulators already rejected the prescription version once. Evofem is planning to resubmit its application by the end of this year. Pelletier says that should be quick enough to bring Amphora, after all its twists and turns, to the market by mid-2020. “It isn’t just a kitschy lifestyle category,” she says. “It’s something that’s really serious and meaningful.”
This sentiment can’t override that pharmaceuticals companies will never be able to sell birth ­control drugs at anything like the prices they get on new treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, or heart disease, lowering interest in reproductive health medicine.
“The pill is as cheap as chips,” says Anna Glasier, honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh. “So everything has to be not much more expensive than that.”

Follow @Brexit, sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, and tell us your Brexit story. 
Boris Johnson has dramatically boosted public spending since taking office, fueling speculation the U.K. prime minister is preparing not only for Brexit by Oct. 31, but a general election as well. The two are likely to be linked.
On Monday, Johnson -- in office less than two weeks -- travels to Lincolnshire, eastern England, to lay out details of his 1.8 billion pound ($2.2 billion) boost for the National Health Service, delivering on his 2016 Brexit campaign vow while maintaining a focus on domestic policies. It follows recent pledges to hire more policy officers and increase infrastructure spending, including on railways.
It’s part of what the government calls economic “boosterism” as it prepares for Brexit on Halloween; it includes a cash injection of 2.1 billion pounds to prepare the economy for a no-deal split from the EU. But despite Johnson’s public words to the contrary, politicians are increasingly taking the rapid domestic policy roll-out as proof he’s gearing up for a snap poll. On Sunday, even Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly didn’t rule it out.
“We’re not going to initiate a general election,” Cleverly told Sky News, a nod to the fact that the most likely trigger for an early national poll -- the next isn’t until 2022 -- would be a no-confidence vote in Parliament put forward by the main opposition Labour Party.
On the same program, Labour’s health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said an election could be “very soon,” suggesting the NHS cash boost was a government tactic to win over voters. The party has strongly hinted it will pursue a confidence vote when Parliament returns in early September.
Last week’s special election in the Welsh constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire showed the potential risk to the government of an early vote.
Defeat for Johnson’s Conservatives reduced his working majority in Parliament to just one, making it that much harder to get any Brexit deal he negotiates with Brussels ratified by lawmakers. One theory is the prime minister will seek to reset the parliamentary arithmetic before he tries.
Yet the result also showed that Johnson’s “do or die” pledge to deliver Brexit in the fall hasn’t yet neutralized the threat from Nigel Farage. In Brecon, the Tories would have won had their candidate secured the 3,331 votes that went to Farage’s Brexit Party. Instead, the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats took the seat.
Aware of the electoral threat, more than 10 Tories have asked the Brexit Party not to run against them, the Mail on Sunday reported.
None of which makes a compelling case for the government to pursue a snap poll. But after Brecon, Johnson is even more vulnerable to a no-confidence vote, especially given there are plenty of potential Tory rebels, including former cabinet ministers, opposed to a no-deal Brexit -- though whether they would vote to bring down their own government is debatable.
The Plan to Avert Banking Chaos in a No-Deal Brexit: QuickTake
According to the Telegraph, Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, told ministers last week that Parliament won’t be able to stop a no-deal Brexit even if the government loses a no-confidence vote, because the prime minister would be able to schedule an election for after the Oct. 31 deadline for the U.K. to leave.
Cummings is already planning the Facebook campaign for a “people versus the politicians” general election after Brexit, the Financial Times reported late Sunday, citing a government official it didn’t identify.
That would put Johnson closer to a more optimal scenario of fighting a general election on his domestic agenda, having already delivered Brexit. But he’s unlikely to get there without a fight in both Parliament and the courts, where anti-Brexit activist Gina Miller is seeking to block any attempt to get Brexit through while the legislature isn’t sitting.
“There are a number of things the House of Commons can do, including bringing down the government and setting up a new one in its place,” prominent Tory rebel Dominic Grieve told BBC radio on Sunday. “There are quite a number of colleagues who, I think, share my very considerable concern about no-deal, which is something which has never been put to the people as an option.”
On Sunday, Labour’s Ashworth said cross-party efforts to prevent a no-deal divorce from the EU would gather pace once the government puts the legislation it needs for Brexit to Parliament in September.
“We will work to stop no-deal,” he told Sky News."

The sumptuous palace in Abu Dhabi was a world away from the shattered homeland he’d left behind. But as the former architect who was now prime minister of Yemen arrived in June for talks with a crucial ally, a more seismic jolt awaited.
Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed had come to the United Arab Emirates wanting cash to get his government through the next stage of its four-year war with Iran-backed rebels who control the Yemeni capital and swaths of territory. Instead, he was bluntly told that the U.A.E. would withdraw its troops from the conflict by the end of the year.
The premier tried to explain to the U.A.E.’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, that a pullout could swing Yemen’s balance of power in favor of Iran and threaten battlefield gains, according to a senior Yemeni official with knowledge of the meeting. But, he was told, the decision had been made.
The U.A.E.’s plan to scale back its role in Yemen is the clearest sign yet that it’s reevaluating its entanglement in Middle East conflicts against the backdrop of a U.S.-Iranian confrontation that has threatened to tip the Persian Gulf into a regional war.
The drawdown points to a clash deep inside the axis that President Donald Trump built to curb Iranian influence after he abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal: some smaller Gulf states may support Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy in theory, but their economies -- and their security -- are vulnerable to a prolonged standoff.
“Iranian tensions are making the Emiratis concerned that any clash could result in the triggering of a general conflict,” said Ryan Bohl, a Middle East analyst at Stratfor.
“An expatriate exodus could happen with few Iranian rockets,” he said. “The Europeans and Americans working there would be the first to flee and that would cripple financial services and real estate.” The U.A.E.’s economic model is based on foreign workers, who comprise more than 80% of the population.
On Tuesday, the U.A.E. sent a delegation of coast guard officials to Iran in the first such visit since 2013. The trip was evidence that the “U.A.E. continues to be one of the savviest foreign policy actors in the Middle East, hedging their foreign policy bets as necessary and willing to walk away from sunk costs,” said Emma Ashford, a research fellow at the Cato Institute.
Attacks on tankers off the U.A.E. had earlier led Emirati officials to call for a rapid deescalation of the crisis. Significantly, they broke with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia in refusing to name Iran as the likely perpetrator of the attacks near the entrance to the Gulf, through which more than a third of the world’s seaborne oil moves. Tehran denies involvement.

The U.A.E. entered the Yemen war in 2015 alongside Saudi Arabia to restore an allied government ousted by the Iranian-backed Houthis, who come from Yemen’s north. An aerial bombardment that officials expected to secure victory within months became a quagmire that sucked in Emirati troops. Since then, 70,000 people have died due to fighting and most Yemenis don’t have enough food. The Houthis continue to send drones and missiles deep inside Saudi Arabia and have the potential to reach the U.A.E.
The stalemate is one example of the increasingly apparent limits to Sheikh Mohammed’s aggressive foreign policy, much of it carried out with his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. There are others.
An assault on the Libyan capital by U.A.E.-backed commander Khalifa Haftar ground to a halt on the city’s outskirts. In Syria, military interventions by Russia and Iran enabled Bashar al-Assad to crush opposition forces supported by the Emiratis and other Gulf states. Now, some U.A.E. officials privately say it was a mistake for Arab countries to burn bridges with Assad, freezing him out of the Arab League and shutting communication channels, while Iran and its proxies built their influence.
“It’s in our interest to do whatever we can to support stability,” a senior U.A.E. official said in a recent briefing with reporters. “We’ve also taken a position that the nuts and bolts, whether they are in Yemen or Sudan or Libya are local issues” that need to be agreed by political factions, the official said.
The U.A.E. has been delivering the same message in private since tensions spiked after Trump tightened sanctions on Iranian oil exports in May, according to a Western official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“It’s no doubt a very difficult decision for the U.A.E. to disengage from Yemen short of their objectives but also in a setting where it has the appearance of leaving the Saudis on their own,” said Barbara Leaf, U.S. ambassador to the U.A.E. until March 2018.
OPEC’s third-biggest producer began shifting from its traditional caution after the Arab Spring toppled longtime leaders in 2011, and Islamists who were strident opponents of hereditary Gulf monarchies took power.
The U.A.E. supported the ouster of Egypt’s first democratically-elected president, Mohamed Mursi, and restoration of military-backed rule. Mursi, who died in June in a Cairo courtroom, was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a region-wide Islamist movement that’s outlawed and fiercely repressed in the U.A.E.
The Emiratis enthusiastically joined the Saudi-led embargo of Qatar, claiming the gas-rich state was too friendly to both the Brotherhood and to Iran.
Dubai, the U.A.E.’s business hub, has long been a conduit for trade with Iran. But Abu Dhabi, the political power center, considers the Islamic Republic’s revolutionary founding principles a mortal danger.
The U.A.E. hasn’t confirmed plans to pull troops out of Yemen but says it has begun to scale back its military presence in the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeidah, after extensive discussions with the Saudis, as part of the Stockholm peace process agreed in December. Its presence elsewhere in the country will “ebb and flow” depending on the situation, the senior U.A.E. official told reporters in the recent briefing.

The strategic rethink took shape as the Yemen imbroglio, and the U.A.E.’s close ties to Riyadh, damaged its global standing.
Anger over the war and the murder of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi fueled bipartisan demands in the U.S. Congress for a ban on weapons shipments to both Gulf countries, a move Trump vetoed July 24. The European Union has called the humanitarian crisis in Yemen the world’s worst, and Germany imposed a ban on all arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia.
The U.A.E. remains aligned with the Saudis on overall strategy, but it is reordering its priorities amid the crisis over Iran.
In Yemen, the U.A.E. had for some time been supporting southern separatists in their bid to fully defeat the Houthis, while the Saudis backed Saeed’s government and focused more on securing the kingdom’s southern border.
Both countries “have been looking for an exit strategy out of Yemen, but one that preserves their respective interests,” said Firas Maksad, adjunct professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School for International Affairs and former executive director of The Arabia Foundation, a research center that was close to the Saudi Arabian government.
The Houthis’ stepped-up targeting of Saudi civilian infrastructure since late last year “has confirmed Saudi suspicions that the Houthis are behaving as a pressure tool for Iran in its ongoing confrontation with the U.S.,” he said.
Something had to give in the relationship, according to Leaf, the former ambassador.
“Nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of armed conflict,” she said. “Any sort of clash, however limited, between U.S. and Iranian forces would naturally put the U.A.E. along with Qatar and Bahrain in a very vulnerable setting.”

Now, caught in the squalls of a shift in global trade and technological change, the nation is pouring money into ideas that could define the way cities are built and run in future, making it a test bed for urban innovation.
The island has few natural resources, hardly any land and faces many of the challenges that beset bigger developed nations such as Germany and Japan -- an aging society, resistance to immigration, reliance on global trade. More than a third of the nation’s exports go to Greater China or the U.S., putting it on the front line in the trade war and battering its latest export figures.
Economists now see Singapore growth in 2019 around 1.4%, down from 2.2% in June, according to a Bloomberg survey.

On the other hand, Singapore offers political stability -- one party has ruled since independence -- world-class transportation and infrastructure, a strong financial system, low crime rates, and a location in the center of some of the world’s fastest-growing economies.
Here are some of the ways the “little red dot” is trying to get ahead in the race to create the city of the future and reinvigorate its economy.
With 5.6 million people on an island half the size of Houston, Singapore’s urban plan has long been to build up. Most citizens live in high-rise public housing developments that are up to 50 stories tall. As space runs out, the city is also putting more unusual amenities in the air.
As well as the world’s highest infinity pool at its iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel, Singapore has rooftop football pitches, parks, vegetable gardens and even a farm with chickens and ducks. The city’s prized pangolins and other animals can scamper across a 62-meter (203-foot) “ecological bridge” connecting two nature reserves without being flatted by the traffic on the six-lane highway below.

But the greening of Singapore’s buildings goes beyond a space constraint. The 160-foot high Supertrees at Gardens by the Bay, or the plant-swathed Parkroyal Hotel in the central business district are part of a plan by the city state to create a “vertical green city.”
The National Parks Board pledged in 2009 to foot the bill for half of installation costs of rooftop and vertical greenery. The aim is to help cut carbon emissions by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030 and by the same time to produce 30% of the city’s nutritional needs locally.
Step aside, millennials. “It’s not a matter of age -- it’s a matter of attitude.”
So says Tan Su Shan, group head of institutional banking at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Southeast Asia’s largest bank wants its senior employees to be at the forefront of training in new digital initiatives.
The bank has hired and trained 80 iPad-toting seniors to assist elderly clients navigate digital banking, said Yeo Wenxian, head of DBS & POSB branch banking. Last year, DBS launched a health and payment program for seniors, complete with a “Smart Sleeve” device that can track daily steps and make everyday payments.

Singapore’s median age is set to rise to 46.8 by 2030 from 39.7 in 2015, making the populace more than a decade older than the global median, according to United Nations projections. The government has responded with an array of programs for older citizens, from fitness groups in local parks, to “digital clinics” at community centers for those who want to master smartphone skills.
It won’t all be fun though. A longer life could soon mean a longer working life too, with the government expected to raise the retirement age from 62.
A limited population with higher wages and fewer young people entering the workforce equals robots. Singapore has its very own micro-city to test autonomous vehicles and a new program for delivering baggage at the city’s award-winning international airport -- two symbols of just how much it’s betting big on robotics.

The nation’s first robot masseuse, Emma, from AiTreat Robotics started work almost two years ago now and Changi airport’s autonomous cleaners, developed by local manufacturer LionsBot International with the Singapore University of Technology and Design, will fan out across the island by year’s end.
The airport’s automated baggage handlers, developed by ground-handling firm SATS Ltd., are being tested and aim to deliver cargo to and from planes in as little as 10 minutes.
One solution to climate change is to make your own climate.
The city state’s late founding leader, Lee Kuan Yew, liked to keep things cool in the equatorial nation and today the city’s air-conditioned skyscrapers are increasingly connected via mazes of underground passages that keep pedestrians clear of the blistering heat and sudden downpours.

Climate control isn’t just for humans. The Cloud Forest biome pampers venus flytraps and eerie epiphytes in a misty world enclosed by 12,000 square meters of glass, including its own Lost World at the top of the dome. Changi’s vast Jewel shopping mall has a similar science-fiction feel, with airport trains zipping along raised tracks around the world’s tallest indoor waterfall.
The nation’s ambitions to control nature go beyond chilling out, though. The city has constructed barrages across the mouths of its main rivers to keep out the sea and create reservoirs of fresh water. And 15 minutes’ drive from the bustling business district, it has built a massive detention tank that can divert 15 Olympic pools’ worth of water to prevent flooding from the nation’s frequent dowpours, operated by automated sensors.
In a smartphone-addicted world it’s no surprise that Singapore is spending billions on fostering digital technology startups and research.
The government plans to build a digital district in the northern suburb of Punggol, where technology companies, startups and the Singapore Institute of Technology can share work spaces to try to foster innovation. It would have a central delivery point for goods to reduce traffic, centralized building management and a district-wide underground vacuum-pipe network to collect waste without trucks.
As a major financial center, one of the focuses of innovation is fintech, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore is doing its part. Officials have created “regulatory sandboxes” that allow selected fintech firms to test out innovations alongside their regulators. Every November it throws a sort of industry party: the FinTech Festival, which attracted 45,000 attendees in 2018, about 50% more than the previous year.
The approach of trying to incubate technology firms from government organizations has even spawned one that’s trying to get people to use technology less.
Plano came from a project led by founder Mo Dirani at the Singapore Eye Research Institute. With 5 billion people predicted to suffer from myopia by 2050, Dirani’s app is designed to warn parents and modify the behavior of children to stop them from being glued to their phones. That would be a breakthrough indeed.

Not many ingredients can bounce comfortably among the worlds of healthy fast-casual bowls, boozy brunch cocktails, and elaborate Michelin-starred menus while also maintaining credibility in the beauty aisle. But perhaps the prettiest entry in this tiny category, which includes turmeric and açai berries, is sea buckthorn.
The vibrant berry comes in a range of oranges and reds and is the Nordic answer to a hit of lemon. Behind its tartness, the pulpy fruit has a light carroty sweetness; if you eat a whole one, it pops tantalizingly in your mouth.
It’s also especially rich in vitamin C (about 12 times as much as an orange) and vitamins. Unlike most plant foods, sea buckthorn contains B12, a nutrient usually found in animal products, making it popular with vegetarians. It’s also one of the few edible plants that has all four omega fatty acids, which can promote collagen growth. In skin products, the berry extract is often applied to sunburns because it’s thought to ease inflammation.
The sea buckthorn bush is native to Asia and Europe and has an affinity for sandy soil. It grows in places as diverse as the Himalayas, Russia, and the Canadian prairies around Manitoba. Its berries ripen in the fall but are challenging to harvest because, true to its name, the bushes are thorny. Alexander Cruz, a partner in Ecole-B, a Quebec-based specialty food marketing company that sources North American products, says that harvesters wait for the branches to freeze and then shake the berries off.
He estimates that demand has grown tenfold in the past decade and lauds the berries’ versatility: “With strawberries and blueberries, there’s just one or two varieties. Sea buckthorn has around 20, more like apples, with flavors that range from 0% acidity, like passion fruit, to super bitter, super tart.” But since they’re hard to harvest and shipped frozen, they can top $15 a pound.
In spite of the expense, sea buckthorn has crept onto menus. At the Russian-celebrating Kachka in Portland, Ore., chef and co-owner Bonnie Morales used the berry in everything from a honey soda drink to a relish for machanka, a Belarusian meaty gravy served with blini, as well as in a vinaigrette for the raw fish dish, scallop stroganina.
In New York, ABCV chef Neal Harden features the juice in a breakfast smoothie bowl. “There’s lots of talk about things like açai, but buckthorn grows closer to home,” he notes. “It also has a tropical fruitlike funk to it and a bracing acidity.” Emma Bengtsson, chef at Michelin two-starred Aquavit, features the berry in her signature Arctic Bird’s Nest dessert with blueberries and goat cheese. “I needed something yellow to symbolize the egg yolk that could also brighten up the richness of the goat cheese parfait,” she says.
At his San Francisco live-fire grill, Prairie, chef Anthony Strong uses it in a healthy-ish gin cocktail made with Cocchi Americano, lime, and ginger. He first mixed it with alcohol at a Beyoncé show, hence the drink’s name: Becky With the Good Hair. “This is exactly the type of drink Becky would drink four of at brunch,” he says. “It’s both cool and not cool—a detox and a retox.”

Exports are falling, and even NBA star-turned-vintner Yao Ming isn’t immune.
A decade ago, basketball legend Yao Ming was such a celebrity in China that he carried the Olympic torch into Tiananmen Square.
But these days, not even the 7-foot, 6-inch Yao can fight his way through the U.S.-China trade war.
Yao’s trouble involves, of all things, wine, his post-NBA business in Napa Valley. Across California, the state’s signature wine business is getting hit by the tit-for-tat tariffs coming out of Washington and Beijing.
China’s latest round of retaliatory tariffs put the combined tax rate on a bottle of American wine at 93%, pushing prices out of reach for much of the Asian country’s growing middle class. Yao Family Wines, started by the Hall of Famer in 2011, has seen its export business drop by half over the past year, said Tom Hinde, the vineyard’s president and winemaker.
California vintners large and small who have spent years building relationships with China are now seeing their work undone by the tariff dispute. Their travails illustrate the far-reaching effects of President Donald Trump’s trade war, where carefully laid business plans from fishing rod suppliers to soybean farmers can turn on the latest headline, meeting or tweet.
“There’s indecisiveness in the outcome, so that puts a pall over the buyers’ enthusiasm,” Hinde said. “We’re hurting ourselves.”
The value of U.S. wine exports to China dropped by 25% in 2018, when the first retaliatory tariffs hit, from 2017, according to the San Francisco-based Wine Institute, an advocacy group for California’s wine industry. The state, which accounts for more than 90% of America’s wine sales to other countries, has borne the brunt of the decline.
While China is the industry’s fifth-largest export market, it’s been viewed as a big opportunity for growth. Vintners worry that years of work cultivating business in the country could be ruined if tariffs persist and Chinese wine drinkers come to view American bottles as too expensive. And even if the levies end, business wouldn’t automatically snap back.
“It’s not like we’re selling socks and we’re suddenly back on the shelf,” said Emma Swain, chief executive officer at St. Supéry Estate Vineyards and Winery in Napa Valley. “Regaining consumer confidence takes time.”
Wine drinkers may not understand that the price they pay is the result of different layers of people passing on the higher tariffs: importers who buy the bottles from the producers; the distributors; and finally the stores or restaurants who sell it to the imbibers.
At M on the Bund, a popular Shanghai restaurant, Swain’s sauvignon blanc before the latest round of tariffs cost the equivalent of $120, about $50 more than a comparable one from New Zealand not subject to the same burden, she said. Now, the restaurant is probably selling it at $220, if it still has it in stock -- Swain said her orders from China have essentially fallen to zero.
Swain and other vintners are looking to countries elsewhere in Asia to fill the void. But there, too, they’ve been undercut by Trump. One of his first acts as president was to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That has lowered the appeal of California wines in Japan, on which import duties remain in place, while those on Australian and New Zealand competitors will eventually go away.  Australia already exports more wine than the U.S.
If the trade war with China grinds on, “we’re going to have open other markets around the world,” said Anthony Hsu, CEO of Maxville Winery in Napa County’s Chiles Valley, where exports have dropped by almost half over the last 10 months. The producer, whose parent is a Chinese company, is now looking to expand its sales in Vietnam and Thailand.
Vintners have been leaning on their elected representatives to bring them relief. It’s unclear if they’ve had any impact on the teetotaler president, who himself owned a Virginia winery that’s now run by his son Eric.
In June, Trump said on CNBC that “California guys” have  complained to him that their wines are charged a lot in France while the U.S. levies a lesser burden on French vintages. He’s vowed to do something about it. Earlier this month, the administration announced it will investigate a French plan on technology companies, a move that has precipitated new tariffs before.
Honore Comfort, vice president of international marketing at the Wine Institute, disagreed that retaliation is the way to go.
“We would rather be in free trade agreements,” she said. “Those comments don’t necessarily help us.”
As for Yao, whose most popular offering sells for $95 and most expensive bottle tops out at $258, the tariff effects are so extreme that his vineyard may accelerate plans to produce wine in China to avoid the levies. That would be a first for a U.S. winery, according to Hinde.
“People aren’t going to stop drinking wine in China because the U.S. and China have a tariff dispute,” Hinde said. “It would be nice if we can wrap this thing up and we can all go back to our business as normal.”

Come for the harmonic pairing of Beyoncé and Donald Glover as they sing the Elton John classics, stay for the comedic fireworks of Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner in Walt Disney’s live-action The Lion King.
That’s the standard take from the reviews of one of Disney’s crown jewels this year, which hits theaters nationwide Friday. But critics have given this version of the beloved tale a frosty reception—only 60% are recommending it, according to aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. With an estimated $175 million-plus opening weekend, it’s still likely to record the second-biggest opening of the year so far, behind only Avengers: Endgame.
“I don’t think critics’ reviews are going to matter as much with this film,” says Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro. Robbins predicts it will generate more than $1.3 billion globally, which would overtake Beauty and the Beast as the biggest of the live action re-imaginings the studio has been plugging away at since the success of Alice in Wonderland in 2010.
The strategy has helped introduce the studio’s most popular characters, from Belle to Aladdin, to a new generation of consumers. It is also contributing to a year in which Disney is exerting a dominance over Hollywood the likes of which Tinseltown has never seen. Since it closed a $71 billion offer for a swath of 21st Century Fox assets in March, the studio’s domestic market share has risen to nearly 35%, more than double its closest rivals, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures.
One of the key indicators that helps explain why audiences will turn out to Lion King, whatever the critics say, is the dominance of Disney’s so-called “event films.” The top-five grossing films so far this year—four of which are Disney movies—account for 36% of the box office ticket sales. In 2018, that sort of box office concentration was less than 23%.
Doug Creutz, analyst at Cowen & Co., has been studying this evolution. He expects that by the end of summer, the top-four-grossing movies from Hollywood’s most lucrative season will account for more than half of all ticket sales. This level of consolidation has happened last year, too, and in 2015. But it was pretty rare before then: From 2001 to 2014, there was only one year in which the top four films exceeded even 40% of the total.
2019 has the potential to be “highly concentrated,” Creutz says. With upcoming sequels of Star Wars and Frozen still on the way, he says it’s possible that the year will set a record for the fewest number of movies that account for the biggest share of the box office. “Nobody wants to put their movie next to Disney’s big movies,” he says.
Compounding the issue is that there is a record number of wide releases this summer—34 of them, compared to the 18-year average of just 24. This makes the odds of success lower for anything that isn’t a huge event at theaters, and the fallout will be born by smaller studios trying to compete with Disney, according to Creutz. Producers and distributors have a tougher choice to make about whether a movie has the ability to survive in a theatrical release, or if streaming is a better fit.
Even this year’s Aladdin, which was widely panned, managed to swing a sizable profit, raising $964 million globally. (Dumbo, which flopped in March, appears to be the rare exception.) The Lion King has already opened in China, the second-biggest movie market, and has bested the results of The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. 
Fans of Beyoncé are doing their part to ensure The Lion King’s success, using the singer’s lion character Nala as their profile pictures on social media as a way to raise the profile of the movie. But for some critics, the fierceness of the singer’s stage persona doesn’t translate. Nala’s “Lions, are you with me?” rallying cry is no “Okay ladies, now let’s get in formation.”
Catalina Combs, of the review site Black Girl Nerds, notes that the best song of the movie isn’t Beyoncé’s but the comedians’ “Hakuna Matata.” “The voice work, combined with the hyperreal CGI during the more emotional scenes, comes off as bad dubbing,” she wrote. “At times, it sounds incredibly cheesy.”
At the screening I attended last week, it was hard to know if what you were seeing was real or digital. Visually, the film is stunning, mixing technology from the gaming world, virtual reality, and real sounds and views of Africa. That seems to have come at the cost of facial expressions that might allow you to connect with a character.
Others were disappointed that the film is a play-by-play of the original 1994 animation. To David Ehrlich of Indiewire, the movie is “a creatively bankrupt self-portrait of a movie studio eating its own tail.”
It isn’t the most powerful Hollywood property when factoring merchandise and other revenue streams—that title might go to Pokémon—but Lion King ranks high and has had remarkable staying power, in large part because of some $9 billion in ticket sales to its stage show, which has run through more than 9,000 performances.
And unlike such Disney properties as Marvel, which are driven by toy sales, the movie merchandise tie-ins include a cosmetic collection by Luminess and Sir John, Beyoncé’s makeup artist, along with $75 crown rings, courtesy of jeweler Pandora. There’s a hat line from milliner Gigi Burris, and Bloomingdales will have its own in-store “Style Kingdom.”
But the fact that even Beyoncé can’t make the movie a resounding success on all measures is perhaps a warning for the studio’s many remakes in store. A live-action version of Lady and the Tramp for Disney’s new streaming service is scheduled for later this year. Mulan is set for a March 2020 release, and Cruella, a reboot of 101 Dalmatians starring Emma Stone, is cued up for 2020. For a remake of The Little Mermaid, Disney is trying to keep the franchise current by casting black actress and singer Halle Bailey as Ariel. The studio has live-action versions of its animated hits scheduled through 2023.

On July 15 a key medicine acquired in the transaction yielded positive results, a small victory in Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley’s bid to overhaul the British drugmaker.
Seeking to catch rivals in the race to produce blockbuster drugs—and silence critics who see Glaxo as a lumbering giant—Big Pharma’s first female CEO is engineering a radical shake-up, taking a different path than Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda Pharmaceutical, and AbbVie, which are reinventing themselves with megadeals.
Walmsley has replaced about 100 of her top 125 managers since she took over in 2017. She hasn’t stopped there—almost a third of the experimental drugs in Glaxo’s pipeline are gone, as well as 3,800 employees. And she’s revealed plans to separate Glaxo’s consumer-health business through a  joint venture with Pfizer Inc. that combines products ranging from Sensodyne toothpaste to Advil.
Glaxo’s path has resembled those of European companies like Volkswagen AG and Nestlé SA, corporate titans that have found themselves vulnerable to disruption from new technologies and market shifts. The largest pharma companies are grappling with ballooning development costs, mounting pushback on prices, and daunting odds—studies suggest more than 90% of potential drugs fail to make it through human testing to the market.
Before Walmsley settled into the role, Glaxo had pulled back in cancer treatment, whiffing on a wave of therapies that have revolutionized the field and led to top-selling products for competitors. Now she’s rebuilding Glaxo’s position in oncology to revitalize its list of drug candidates.


Data: Compiled by Bloomberg
Still, the company’s stock has barely moved since April 2017, reflecting investors’ lack of enthusiasm for Glaxo’s new direction. Shares of British rival AstraZeneca Plc have surged about 30% over the same period. “What understandably people want to see is evidence of a future pipeline that’s going to drive growth,” Walmsley says.
Her strategy has revolved around focusing on fewer, but potentially more lucrative, opportunities rather than massive takeovers, such as AbbVie’s agreement in June to  buy Allergan for $63 billion, Bristol’s  $74 billion deal for Celgene, and Takeda’s  $62 billion acquisition of Shire. While Walmsley has signaled interest in more transactions since the Tesaro purchase and a partnership struck in  February with Merck KGaA, she questions the logic of huge deals. “Companies can die of indigestion just as easily as they can die of starvation,” she says. “I’m not completely convinced that scale is a huge advantage.”
Walmsley wasn’t the obvious choice to lead the drugmaker into the next frontier of therapies to fight cancer and other diseases. After 17 years at cosmetics company L’Oréal SA, she moved in 2010 to Glaxo’s consumer unit, home to brands including Tums and Nicorette. That experience led some investors to incorrectly assume she would hang on to that business.
The Oxford-educated CEO is relying on a new team of high-profile specialists to help carry out her plans. She hired Hal Barron, a drug hunter with close ties to the California biotech sector, as head of research and poached Luke Miels from Astra to run the pharma division. “What has surprised me is how much impact changing even a few people can have,” Walmsley says, adding that her mission is to achieve a “culture shift.” Of the roughly 100 management changes she’s made, about 1 in 3 new leaders comes from outside Glaxo.
Walmsley has eagerly sought experts’ opinions and turned her lack of pharma experience into an advantage, says Laurie Glimcher, a Glaxo board member and CEO of the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “Coming from the outside to a fresh area is sometimes the best thing you can do.”
Ultimately, Walmsley will be judged on whether she brings Glaxo back into the top tier of R&D performers. The company has launched a shingles vaccine that quickly achieved $1 billion in annual sales, rolled out HIV treatments, and moved ahead with three oncology drugs it hopes will be available in 2020. Glaxo in May revamped the way it pays sales reps to better reward individual efforts, reversing a policy introduced several years ago following allegations that it improperly promoted some of its products.
With a slimmer but sharper stable of drugs, patience is required. “Her biggest challenge is time,” says Darrell Baker, the former head of Glaxo’s respiratory business who left in 2015. “It’s like a rosebush in the winter. After the pruning stage, you have to wait to see how much it’s going to blossom.”

The appointment of Symonds, currently the deputy chairman at HSBC Holdings Plc, still needs to be finalized and is subject to approval from banking regulators, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
Glaxo will announce a new chairman “in due course,” the company said in an email, declining to comment further. According to the person familiar with the talks, that could happen in coming weeks.
Symonds would replace Philip Hampton, who said earlier this year he was stepping down. The next chairman will help steer the British drug company as it splits its consumer-health business from the pharma and vaccines units, moves into the lucrative cancer field and deals with uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
Hampton has overseen a number of changes over the past four years, including the appointment of a new chief executive officer, Emma Walmsley, in 2017. Glaxo last year agreed to create a consumer-health joint venture with Pfizer Inc., a prelude to its separation.

Waterproof shoe compartments, stain-resistant suedes, and secret pockets are the latest in a new class of professional purses.
Clockwise from top left: Anya Hindmarch Postbox Bag, Caraa Studio Tote, Knomo London Derby Leather Tote, Prada Nylon Pouch, and Lo & Sons Seville. 
Handbags with organizational compartments aren’t known for being chic. They’re more the realm of busy soccer moms than fashion influencers. But with the ongoing popularity of athleisure and new social-media savvy lines such as Dagne Dover and Caraa, convenience and functionality are a bigger part of the pitch to professional women on the go. Sales of traditional handbag makers in the U.S. were down 7% during the 12 months ending May 2019, says Beth Goldstein, analyst for fashion and handbags at research firm NPD. One bright spot in the industry—valued at $8.6 billion in the U.S.—are bags with innovative organizational techniques. “The meaning of luxury is starting to change,” Goldstein says. “Consumers are responding to these brands that are solving problems. They are seeing a lot of value in that.”
For instance, New York-based Lo & Sons specializes in a two-in-one tote called the  Seville ($428), which has an interchangeable shell design to transform it into a travel bag. 
The Jemma handbag line, launched in 2015, features a model called the Emma ($395) with pockets dedicated to every item you can think to put in a purse—a tablet sleeve, a phone pocket, a lipstick holder, a credit-card pocket—plus a nifty central zipper pocket that can be detached and worn as a smaller crossbody bag.
In its Traveler configuration, there’s also a back pocket that can be unzipped at the bottom, creating a sleeve that slides onto the handle of a carry-on suitcase, allowing you to secure it while rushing through a busy airport.Joanna Lau, founder and chief executive officer of Jemma, created the purse after striking out in her search for a handbag she could carry to work as a trader on Wall Street. “Many from established brands don’t include these pockets,” she says. “People are constantly digging for things that go missing in their bags.”
Professional organizer Kacy Paide recommends totes from the Montreal-based brand Want Les Essentiels for its sleek lines and luxury look. The company’s Lesage Leather Work Tote ($895) has three distinct sections and multiple interior pockets with magnetic closures, which are easier to use than sliding zippers.   
The Knomo London Derby Leather Tote ($349) also has a cleverly concealed top compartment for such items as your phone, wallet, and keys that you want accessible but hidden, while the large interior pocket can fit a water bottle and a pair of shoes.
For Laura Cattano, a professional organizer in New York who has worked with Lena Dunham and Misty Copeland, the key to avoiding handbag clutter is going through your purse at the end of each day. But she recognizes that many people don’t have the time or inclination to do so.  She turns to British label Anya Hindmarch, whose bags have small interior slots for credit cards and cash. “Her whole angle is about organization,” Cattano says of the designer. “I have some of her smaller bags. It has a little wallet inside the bag.” 
The purses don’t sacrifice style for functionality. For instance, Hindmarch’s Postbox Bag ($1,550) has a handmade vintage-gold frame and a shoulder strap that you can personalize. 
Melanie Charlton, a founder of closet design firm Clos-ette who has worked with Beyonce and Jay Z, says some of her clients are using Prada’s new pouches to store items in their purses. The brand’s Nylon Pouch ($480) is made with Saffiano leather and offers two zippered internal compartments, along with two external pockets.  Multiple compartments are also ideal for bags that need to transition between the office and the gym. Carmen Chen Wu, founder of handbag line Caraa, recognized the need for a combination purse and gym bag that looks more professional than a Nike duffel. 
She designed the  Caraa Studio Tote ($225), which has adjustable and removable backpack straps to transform the bag and distribute the weight between shoulders. And it has a waterproof built-in shoe compartment that keeps smelly sneakers and clothes separate from other items. “Our lining is antimicrobial, so it won’t mold and will never start smelling,” Wu says. “The interiors of our bags are all wipeable.”
For a further multitasking option, the Senreve Voya Tote ($895) has eight interior pockets and a roomy main compartment that’s big enough to fit a spare pair of flats or a change of clothes. A suede, removable laptop sleeve gives you two bags in one, while the Italian scratch-resistant leather can handle a haul from the office to the gym to happy hour.
Avoid the tote trend that’s “just a bucket,” Cattano says. “Sections are good,” she says. “If you just throw everything in the bag, then you don’t know where anything is.”

Today in Brexit: Can the next prime minister suspend Parliament? The Queen might have something to say about that.
Boris Johnson, the front-runner to become prime minister, has repeatedly refused to rule out suspending Parliament to push through Brexit against its will.
It raises lots of thorny constitutional questions — former Prime Minister John Major has threatened to take Johnson to court if he tries to send lawmakers home to pursue a  no-deal divorce without them. But the  main obstacle might be the Queen, Bloomberg’s Robert Hutton and Kitty Donaldson report. It’s up to the monarch to issue the order, which she traditionally does on the advice of her prime minister.
“The question constitutional experts are all debating is whether the Palace could say ‘No,’” said Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government. “It’s all something of a gray area in our system.”
One of the long-standing goals both of Buckingham Palace officials and civil servants has been to shield the monarch from political controversy. “The Sovereign does not become publicly involved in the party politics of government,” according to the Cabinet Manual, the official guide to Britain’s unwritten constitution.
Government aides would be likely to urge the prime minister not to put Queen Elizabeth II in a difficult position by asking the question, according to Haddon.
But if she was asked anyway, the Queen would still have options. She could ask him to reconsider. Or she could stall — giving Parliament the time to do what it was trying to do.
Getting involved in politics might not be good for the monarchy’s long-term chances of survival. It could stir republican sentiment and revive dormant questions about its relevance. Add Britain’s muddle-along approach to a constitution to the list of things put in question by Brexit.
Need a flowchart for the weekend? Here’s our latest take on where we are, and where we might be going:
—  Emma Ross-Thomas
 Next Chancellor? | Treasury Minister Liz Truss — a prominent supporter of Johnson’s bid to become prime minister —  said the Conservative Party should make the case for a Thatcher-style, low-tax economic policy to boost growth after Brexit. At a lunch with reporters in Parliament, she also made no secret of her ambition to be chancellor.
Braced for Brexit | The risks of a no-deal Brexit have increased, the Bank of England said, warning that such an outcome could slam the pound, government bonds and house prices. It would bring “significant market volatility and asset-price changes,” along with “material economic disruption.” Most of the threats to cross-border banking services have been mitigated, it said, though more action on the EU side is needed.
Fear Nor Favor | Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told U.K. diplomats to speak “truth to power,” after the leak of the Darroch memos led him to quit. Johnson’s failure to back the ambassador could be an opportunity for Hunt, the underdog in the Tory leadership race.
Not Done Yet | Fewer than half the Tory members picking the next prime minister have returned their vote slips, The Times reports. That suggests there’s still time for Hunt to pull ahead. Both candidates will be interviewed on the BBC on Friday night.
Rate Cut Call | The Bank of England will cut interest rates in November, analysts at the Royal Bank of Canada said, the first prediction of policy easing this year. They reckon the central bank won’t be able raise rates, even in the event of a smooth Brexit.
On the Markets | The pound traded 0.2 % higher at $1.2545 early on Friday. It’s down about 5% from this time last year — the day Prime Minister Theresa May published her controversial plan for what Britain’s post-Brexit  relationship with the EU should be. That prompted Johnson to resign from her Cabinet.

The British Virgin Islands is home to more than 400,000 companies that hold $1.5 trillion in assets. You wouldn’t know it if you walked through Road Town, the capital of this Caribbean archipelago. Hens and roosters compete brazenly with cars on the single narrow lane of Main Street. Law firms that set up and serve thousands of offshore companies occupy modest buildings next to brightly painted wooden houses that host cheap beauty salons and clothing shops with names like Goodfellas.
Besides a few mangled green street signs on Main Street, few roads are marked. The BVI doesn’t have mail delivery; its businesses and 32,000 residents use post office boxes as their addresses, which is why one P.O. box in Road Town can be the nominal home to thousands of companies from around the world. Hundreds of lawyers, accountants, and company agents work from buildings dotted around the main island of Tortola. In some tax havens—Luxembourg,  Monaco, or even parts of the Cayman Islands—money is dripping off every corner. In the BVI, the wealth passes through almost without a trace.
When I visited in April, my first stop was Tobacco Wharf, a collection of anonymous-looking houses tucked off the main road, where the global accounting company BDO Ltd. occupies a four-story green-and-beige building surrounded by palm trees. Inside I was greeted by Ryan Geluk, a lanky, bearded accountant who serves as the company’s deputy managing director on the island, and Neil Smith, the BVI’s director of international business. Geluk started tapping away on a keyboard to show me the database he’s so proud of: the Beneficial Ownership Secure Search System, or BOSS, which the BVI started using in 2017 to satisfy international demands that it keep track of the owners of its companies. A screen on the wall showed a dataset. He clicked on Almighty Dollar, a company registered to P.O. Box 9272 in Road Town in December 2007, with a passport number and date of birth for its owner, John Zykov-Wumu.

Almighty Dollar isn’t a real company but rather a prototype, which is all Geluk could show me. Even though he helped get it up and running, Geluk doesn’t have permission to scan the whole database. In fact, only two people, a pair of unnamed employees of the BVI’s Financial Investigation Agency, are able to search the entire system, which holds details on about 600,000 owners who have directly or indirectly controlled companies here. It’s thought that roughly a third of all offshore companies globally are registered in the BVI.
Geluk said BOSS uses encryption that’s never been hacked. “If someone accesses it from somewhere unusual like North Korea, it will be shut down immediately,” he told me, adding that the data are housed in a secret location known only to him and his team. “All I can say,” he said, “is it’s held in a G-7 country, and it’s not the U.S.” 
Change is coming to the BVI, though not if the politicians and businesspeople here—as well as plenty of less-connected people—can help it. Last year the U.K. Parliament voted to force transparency on the BVI and the 13 other British Overseas Territories, a collection of former colonies where the flags display the Union Jack, the queen appoints a governor to control foreign affairs and law enforcement, and the judicial system is based on English common law. It was a rare moment of cross-party consensus among British members of Parliament, who have been in gridlock since 2016 over the terms of leaving the European Union. The crucial part of the transparency legislation is a requirement that each Overseas Territory produce something like BOSS and make it public.



The BVI’s place in the dark offshore economy was illuminated by the 2016  Panama Papers leak, in which 11.5 million documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca were released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The disclosures sparked probes worldwide into money laundering, sanctions violations, and tax avoidance, and it didn’t pass without notice that more than half the companies outed in the leak were registered in the BVI. (The scandal should have been called the BVI Papers, more than a few people suggested.) It was clear from the disclosures that BVI regulation was inadequate, and that remains a concern today: Last year, BVI regulators conducted only four on-site inspections of financial firms.
People here are well aware of the outrage over hidden wealth and lost tax revenue. They just don’t believe they’re to blame, and many people deny that their country is even a tax haven or a secrecy jurisdiction. The BVI is, in fact, one of the most vocal opponents of the worldwide transparency drive, which makes the success or failure of its pushback a barometer of whether the global squeeze on the offshore industry is working.
When you walk the dusty streets of Road Town, it isn’t immediately clear why local people would be invested in the transparency fight. The companies registered here don’t pay taxes. Entire islands in the 60-island archipelago are owned by rich people from other countries (Richard Branson owns  Necker Island; Google’s Larry Page owns Eustasia), and there are few signs that wealthy people who use the BVI spend much money in the local economy. Damage from Hurricane Irma, which swept over the BVI in September 2017, is still evident everywhere. But islanders up and down the economic scale answered my questions about transparency the same way: The BVI would be a much poorer place without its financial-services industry. The government charges a $450 fee to form a company with fewer than 50,000 shares and another $450 a year to maintain registration. As modest as that might sound, it’s what makes the economy go. Financial services account for 62% of the BVI’s $372 million in government revenue, and the number will probably decline if it adopts a public register of company owners.
Over the past few years, the EU has threatened to  blacklist the BVI and other territories unless they adopt rules to prevent global corporations from avoiding taxes by shifting profits to shell companies in zero-tax offshore jurisdictions. Corporate profit shifting is estimated to result in $600 billion in lost tax revenue annually for countries around the globe, according to the International Monetary Fund. Under new rules that take effect this year, any company that declares itself a tax resident of the BVI must have “economic substance” on the ground in the form of a local office, employees, and appropriate expenditures. Other, more developed offshore centers will be bound by the same rules, but the impact on the BVI is likely to be more pronounced, potentially forcing thousands of companies to shut down or try to scale up in Road Town, with its tiny population and severely limited infrastructure. Some locals are worried that companies may simply go elsewhere.
But the U.K. transparency push is seen as the bigger threat. The law passed by Parliament requires the government to order Overseas Territories to create public registers by 2020. Concerned it might cause a revolt from the former colonies, the U.K. government opposed the move by MPs and interpreted the ambiguously worded legislation to mean it could give the territories until 2023. MPs backing the rules say they can force adherence to the original deadline. “They trade under our flag, and they have to accept our values,” says Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative Party MP who pushed for the rules. “Unless you have the transparency that open, public registers bring, you can’t join up the dots and spot clever money laundering and malfeasance.”
The standoff has put the legacy of the British Empire in stark relief. Parliament can legislate for the territories, but islanders, who are U.K. citizens, can’t vote in U.K. elections unless they live in the U.K. Many in the BVI view the imposition of a public register as a violation of their constitutional relationship with Britain. More than 1,000 people marched in protest last May in Road Town, with placards that read “No Imperial Legislation” and “End Colonial Rule.” The then-deputy premier, Kedrick Pickering, declared “open war against the U.K.”
One evening during my visit, islanders lined up in the waiting room of the BVI’s House of Assembly, a tired beige building where pictures of Queen Elizabeth II and the BVI’s newly elected premier, Andrew Fahie, hung side by side. They were all waiting to see Fahie, a stout man in a dark suit who plays piano with the gospel choir at his church. Fahie was elected in February after leading a working group that supported giving Overseas Territories veto power over laws that Parliament passes which affect them. Years ago a previous premier nicknamed Fahie the Brown Bomber, after boxer Joe Louis, reportedly because of his tenacious approach to politics. The name stuck.
On a break from late-night budget talks, Fahie told me the BVI won’t introduce public registers until they’re adopted worldwide. “We’re not complying when the U.K. pushes it, but when it becomes a global standard,” he said.
Not surprisingly, many people in Road Town argue there are perfectly legitimate reasons to use a jurisdiction such as the BVI. The Panama Papers leak revealed, for example, that British actress Emma Watson bought her London house with a BVI company to prevent stalkers from tracing where she lives. The BVI is seen as a convenient neutral territory for basing international joint ventures without an additional layer of taxation. Silicon Valley investors, for example, might feel more comfortable investing in a Russian tech venture based in the BVI, with its English common-law system, instead of Russia, where courts remain prone to corruption.
But transparency threatens none of that. What it threatens is the BVI’s crucial role in often elaborate attempts to conceal the identity of the ultimate owners of assets, making it difficult to trace funds in business disputes, tax investigations, and money laundering probes.
Ownership arrangements also often use that other legacy of the British Empire—the Crown Dependencies of the Channel Islands,  Guernsey, and Jersey. A simple structure to camouflage the ownership of funds might look like this: A wealthy individual sets up a trust in Jersey to own a BVI company that in turn has a Swiss bank account. “They call that entry level,” says John Christensen, who worked as a forensic investigator in Jersey at Deloitte, the global accounting company, before joining Tax Justice Network, a group that campaigns against tax havens. “For bigger players it would be many more jurisdictions.” The Crown Dependencies don’t tax most companies and don’t disclose who ultimately owns the companies registered there, but they, too, are about to change. After British legislators also threatened to impose public registers on them, the Channel Islands, Guernsey, and Jersey announced in June they would do so voluntarily by 2023.
The implications are far-reaching. The offshore industry is a sort of Jenga tower, with each tax haven like a block that supports the elaborate structure of the world’s hidden finances. The moves of the past year are akin to pulling out multiple blocks at once. The BVI is near the base of the tower, and if it can be made to shift beyond a certain point, the offshore industry as we know it might crumble. 
The man who helped invent the modern-day offshore industry is an 81-year-old Oxford-educated lawyer named Michael Riegels, who moved to the BVI in the early 1970s to escape civil unrest in his home country of Tanzania. I visited him at his hillside villa, where a large living room opens up onto an expansive terrace with views of the Caribbean Sea. Sitting on a wicker chair next to the pool with his wife, Norma, he recalled that when he first came to the BVI, it was like stepping back in time. “Men would take their hat off and say, ‘Morning, sir. Good day to you,’ ” he said. “Then we were discovered by some New York lawyers.”
Calls from New York were unusual back then; undersea cables for the BVI’s international telephone lines weren’t laid until a few years before. At the time, the U.K. and the U.S. had a double tax treaty that extended to the BVI. If an American company set up in the BVI, the treaty reduced its U.S. withholding tax rate on dividends paid out of the U.S. from 30% to 15%, which could then be applied as a credit against the BVI tax of 15%—and presto! Zero tax. Riegels, who was a partner at the local law firm Harneys, says he helped Bob Marley, Cat Stevens, and other musicians set up BVI companies to avoid paying tax on their royalties. (Stevens called his 1973 album Foreigner because he moved to Brazil as a tax exile that year.)
The U.S. government issued a critical report on tax havens in 1981, saying the treaty was costing it hundreds of millions of dollars, and canceled it soon after. “That was a bit disappointing to us,” Riegels said. “We were doing quite nicely.”
That’s when Paul Butler, a partner at the New York law firm Shearman & Sterling, suggested BVI law be rewritten to make it attractive to international investors. Five lawyers, including Riegels and the then-attorney general for the islands, Lewis Hunte, set about drafting the new legislation, pinching from statutes around the world but borrowing heavily from Delaware, which had made selling shell companies a big business. With their help, the BVI government approved the International Business Companies Act in 1984. The Bahamas and the Cayman Islands adopted similar legislation.
“It took off like an express train,” Riegels said. “Within two years, we celebrated forming a hundred companies in a month, which was beyond our wildest dreams at that time.”
Plenty of international companies used the BVI not necessarily to avoid taxes but to escape regulations, Riegels said. But some companies, and the people who owned them, were clearly using the BVI to avoid scrutiny. Riegels remembered a man who came into his office in the 1980s with a paper bag stuffed with $300,000 to buy a yacht from one of his clients. He said he thought it was odd but took the money without asking too many questions. Later he saw reports that the same boat had been seized, full of drugs, by U.S. officials.
“When I read about it, I thought, I shouldn’t have done that,” he said. “We should have realized this eventually would be used by the morally challenged. We were extremely naive to think all our clients were respectable businessmen. We didn’t ask a lot of questions.”
It wasn’t until the late 1980s that the BVI became one of the world’s most popular destinations for company registrations. Riegels said the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama forced that country’s nascent offshore industry to move to the BVI. Around the same time, Hong Kong investors, led by billionaire Li Ka-shing, the founder of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., started using BVI companies to hold assets before the 1997 handover to China. By the 1990s, Riegels said, his firm was incorporating 1,000 companies every month, with the biggest source of business being wealthy Chinese. “The 1990s was the boom period,” he said.
Over the past decade, scandals have repeatedly washed over the BVI. Some of the offshore feeder funds that collected money from investors and funneled cash to prop up Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme were based in the BVI, as were some companies involved in the $230 million tax fraud by Russian officials that was exposed by Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009 after  uncovering the scheme.
Then, in 2013, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists began rolling out stories based on a leak of 2.5 million offshore documents. The investigation, dubbed Offshore Leaks, would turn out to be the first of many disclosures that made the BVI look like the jurisdiction of choice for money laundering and tax evasion. Everyone from arms dealers to wealthy Americans and Indonesian billionaires had BVI companies.
Offshore Leaks spurred global regulators to attack the secrecy of offshore jurisdictions. That year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Europe established a standard for the automatic exchange of financial information, endorsed by the Group of 20, allowing countries to trace funds that were “unknown or unknowable.” More than 100 jurisdictions signed up.
When the Panama Papers hit, the fallout was severe. This time politicians worldwide were among those shown to have undisclosed offshore accounts. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the U.K. should consider imposing  direct rule on the Overseas Territories if they continued to condone tax evasion on an “industrial scale.” (The U.K. government set up its own public register after the Panama Papers, revealing for the first time who owns or controls companies in Britain.)
The succession of leaks put enormous pressure on BVI authorities to do something that would save their financial industry while satisfying global regulators. In June 2017 the BVI enacted legislation requiring company formation agents—there are now roughly 140—to upload information on the beneficial owners of companies to a private database. Hence BOSS, which makes it harder for individuals who control a company to hide behind nominee shareholders if U.K. law enforcement agencies start asking questions. Most companies registered in the BVI since 2016 need a real person standing behind them with passport details, a name, and an address. Those details can be shared with British investigators. But loopholes exist, allowing, for instance, trusts and corporations listed on stock exchanges to escape scrutiny. 
Perched on a sloping hill in Road Town, surrounded by palm trees, is a gated white mansion that serves as the office of the BVI’s 40-year-old governor, Gus Jaspert, a blond, blue-eyed, soft-spoken Brit. Sitting next to a picture of Queen Elizabeth II, who appointed him to the post in 2017, Jaspert sounds like the quintessential diplomat, stuck between British MPs intent on forcing transparency on the Overseas Territories and a BVI government determined to fight them every step of the way. He says the BVI is already doing a good job of providing the U.K.’s National Crime Agency with information on individuals with companies in the BVI. Jaspert, who oversees the BVI’s Financial Investigation Agency, says it turns around 90% of requests in 24 hours. He suggests a compromise could be found by somehow designing a public register that would also safeguard people’s privacy.
“It’s quite easy to throw around buzzwords like transparency,” Jaspert says. “What a final register looks like, that’s still in development.”
If BVI officials get their way, the register will be far from fully accessible to the public. One idea under consideration is a system to notify individuals that their information is being sought and by whom, allowing them an opportunity to stop the release of details. Another idea I heard: making it accessible only in the BVI, forcing people to physically go there to see the information. How exactly these ideas would work and whether the U.K. would greenlight them remains unclear, but it sounds like an attempt to create a public register in name only if the BVI is backed into a corner.
When British MPs voted to impose public registers on the Overseas Territories, the islands were still reeling from Hurricane Irma. Bishop John Cline of the New Life Baptist Church, who helped lead the march against public registers, said the U.K. was undermining the local economy when it was most vulnerable. “It’s nothing more than modern-day colonialism,” said Cline, sitting in his Road Town office, where he’s hung a picture of Martin Luther King Jr. “I don’t see how you can oppress us on the one hand and on the other hand expect us to function in any viable way.”
That said, Cline thinks the BVI’s dependence on financial services has skewed the economy, taking the focus away from building infrastructure that might help the tourism industry flourish. “The financial industry became almost the cash cow, and right now the cash cow is sick,” he said.
The mantra on the ground is that the U.K. should clean up its own act before imposing more stringent rules on the BVI. The BVI’s company agents are required to check the identity and source of funds of owners before setting up companies. In the U.K. there are no agents, which means you can form a company in less than a day for only £12 ($15) by simply logging on to the Companies House registry’s online system and uploading three pieces of personal information. For all the transparency of the U.K. system, anticorruption campaigners say it’s been used for fraud and money laundering. In the $230 billion money laundering  scandal that has engulfed Danske Bank, regulators traced money flowing from Russia via Baltic banks using U.K.-registered companies as well as BVI shells.
Law enforcement officials in the U.K. say the BVI has helped them with ongoing investigations, but BVI regulation still doesn’t look rigorous, given the low number of on-site inspections. It’s telling that although regulators fined Mossack Fonseca $440,000—the largest fine ever in the islands—after the Panama Papers leak, the firm retained its license to operate until it shut down last year.
I wanted to explore this with the BVI Financial Services Commission, which is in charge of licensing and inspecting company agents. But for weeks before my visit, no one answered the phone numbers listed on the commission’s website and various officials ignored my countless emails. I went to the commission’s office on the east end of Road Town, where a sign outside the building reads “Vigilance, Integrity, Accountability,” and spoke briefly with the commission’s deputy managing director, Kenneth Baker, explaining I was writing a story about the BVI. He told me to leave a note for the commission’s communications chief. A few days later, the FSC finally responded, but only to decline my requests for an interview. Elise Donovan, the head of BVI Finance, the industry trade body, told me later that the territory is compliant with global anti-money-laundering regulations and carries out more checks on company owners than the U.K. does.
One of the most passionate and prominent opponents of public registers is the Canadian lawyer and fraud investigator Martin Kenney. Sitting in his office in Road Town, surrounded by towers of papers, Kenney said transparency will simply cause the fraudsters to use more devious means to avoid detection and migrate to black holes like the Seychelles, or even Delaware, where he said it’s more difficult to get information than in the BVI. That will only make it harder and more expensive to track them down, he said. “Al Capone isn’t stupid. Whatever mousetrap you build, they will find ways to get around it.”
He told a long and complex story about his recent recovery of millions in stolen assets tied to a bankrupt Brazilian energy company, whose principal shifted the ownership of assets into offshore companies in multiple jurisdictions and established dummy nominees to shield them from Brazilian bankruptcy court. In a process that required court orders in three countries, Kenney proved that the nominees—two Costa Ricans, one of whom owned a small laundry shop and the other a computer repair shop—were fronts. He clawed back the assets. “The system worked,” Kenney said emphatically. “If you disrupt it, I fear the costs and the risks from the victim side will go up and up.”
Anticorruption campaigners disagree with Kenney’s whack-a-mole theory, arguing that just because the bad guys might pop up elsewhere doesn’t mean regulators shouldn’t attempt to crack down where they can. At any rate, the global push for transparency may be unstoppable. Last year the EU passed new rules requiring public registers in all member states by January 2020. Germany and the Netherlands have led the way. There are some in the BVI who say the only way to survive is to embrace the changes.
At the Island Roots cafe in Road Town, I talked with Colin Riegels, Michael’s 47-year-old son, who sipped an iced latte while reggae music blared and lawyers and accountants mingled. Just a bit older than the BVI’s offshore industry itself, Riegels is carrying on his father’s mantle as Harneys’ managing partner for the BVI. He was sanguine about the new rules, saying public registers were inevitable. He observed, too, that with all the changes afoot, the BVI’s model of pocketing a steady stream of fees from an ever-rising number of offshore incorporations was likely to falter anyway. Since 2014 the number of companies registered annually in the BVI has fallen by 16%. “There’s been a fairly steady move from what you might call a more Wild West type of environment to a much more closely regulated and transparent business environment,” Riegels said. “It’s a bump in the road, but the road isn’t coming to an end.”
Fahie, for all his talk about defying the U.K. on increased transparency, is also developing a vision of a transformed BVI. He said he wants to diversify the economy to reduce reliance on company formations, rebrand the islands as a tourist destination, and get into cryptocurrencies. It was a little vague. What was clear was that he recognized the BVI is not entirely in charge of its own destiny. “When you get in a fight,” the premier said, “you have to understand you may win or you may lose.”

President Donald Trump is hoping his daughter-in-law can help shore up his standing with female voters.
Lara Trump -- wife of the president’s son, Eric Trump -- will launch the “Women for Trump Coalition“ aimed at aiding the president’s re-election campaign. It will debut next Tuesday at a casino in suburban Philadelphia, where she will be joined by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, former White House communications aide Mercedes Schlapp, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the ex-Fox News personality who is dating Trump’s eldest son.
“The Women for Trump coalition will be a national effort to mobilize and empower women who support President Trump to help get the message of ‘Promises Made. Promises Kept’ into their communities across America,“ Hannah Castillo, director of coalitions for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.
Trump, who has frequently come under fire for his past treatment of women, has consistently struggled to win the approval of female voters, with 52% of women surveyed earlier this month by Gallup saying they believed the president should be impeached. Trump won 41% of the female vote in 2016.
Bernie Sanders published a list of “anti-endorsements” on his presidential campaign website with quotes from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other luminaries of Wall Street and beyond.
“Bernie Sanders, in my opinion, doesn’t have a clue,” Leon Cooperman, a former partner at Goldman Sachs, is quoted as saying.
“It has the potential to be a dangerous moment,” Blankfein said of Sanders’s campaign.
“In 2016 I saw Bernie Sanders and the kids around him. I thought: ‘This is the antichrist!”’ said Home Depot Co-Founder Kenneth Langone.
Sanders, a Vermont senator and avowed democratic socialist, is running a campaign focused on taking on the billionaires and Wall Street elite. The web page approvingly quotes Franklin Roosevelt -- “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made” -- and Frederick Douglass.
In a statement Sanders said of the business leaders quoted: “we welcome their hatred.”
Other quotes listed include:
“The senator’s uninformed views are, in a word, contemptible” -- Lowell McAdam, former Verizon CEO.
“If Bernie Sanders became president, I think stock prices should be 30% to 40% lower than they are now” -- Stanley Druckenmiller, hedge fund manager. -- Emma Kinery
Billionaire Tom Steyer is on a roll. Two days after announcing his presidential candidacy, he has already spent $1.4 million on TV ads in the key first nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.
The ads also will run nationally on CNN and MSNBC for two weeks.
Steyer, 62, hinted at a run a 2020 run early this year, but showed up in Des Moines, Iowa, in January only to announce he had decided against it. The hedge fund manager, who has been focused on impeaching President Donald Trump, announced his candidacy in a video message on Monday.
Few candidates have done a single TV ad yet, and none has spent as much money as Steyer has. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York launched ads Tuesday targeting Trump in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, where she will be traveling this week. Representatives Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts ran TV ads in June. Former Maryland Representative John Delaney, the first to join the race, bought a TV ad during the 2018 Super Bowl. -- Emma Kinery
Senate leaders clashed on the chamber floor about how Congress could prevent foreign interference in the 2020 elections, as the Trump administration was scheduled Wednesday to give lawmakers a long-awaited briefing about its efforts to prevent a repeat of Russian meddling in 2016.
House and Senate lawmakers will be briefed by a group of top administration officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan. They will appear after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer pushed for months for the meetings, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell only recently getting on board.
Still, the two top Senate leaders continue to spar over whether any further legislation addressing election security will be needed this year. McConnell made no promises.
Instead, the Republican took to the Senate floor to blame former President Barack Obama for being too soft on Russia, which he said paved the way for the 2016 election meddling. He insisted that under the Trump administration there has been “greater success” including the indictment of 28 Russian nationals and entities by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and passage of $380 million in funding to help states combat potential hacking.
Schumer insisted Republicans “fought tooth and nail” against that funding and that top GOP leaders continue to show little interest in measures that would help protect state voting systems and combat foreign influence through social media. -- Laura Litvan
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who’s been traveling across the U.S. trying to ignite interest in a long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, seized upon the Women’s World Cup parade in his city to tout his progressive credentials.
He kicked off the parade on Wednesday vowing that as president he would “pursue executive action” if necessary to “guarantee equity in resources and pay for women’s and men’s national sports teams.” Team members have sued the U.S. Soccer Federation over the issue.
The U.S. Women’s soccer team during their World Cup ticker-tape parade in New York on July 10.
The mayor addressed the crowd, saying, “The equality of women must be guaranteed in this nation,” as thousands chanted, “Equal Pay USA.”
The event featured the women’s team waving to tens of thousands of people as they made their way on the back of a truck up the “Canyon of Heroes,” a half-mile stretch that fans packed on both sides of lower Broadway. Shredded recycled paper floated down from office towers above.
The event was bound to take on political significance after Megan Rapinoe, one of the team’s stars and leaders, rejected any possibility that the team would visit Trump’s White House. Trump posted messages on Twitter attacking Rapinoe. -- Henry Goldman
Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday reintroduced legislation requiring publicly owned companies to disclose their exposure to climate-related risks.
The measure is cosponsored by three fellow Democratic presidential contenders, Senators Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Climate change is a top issue for Democratic voters in polls. Warren’s bill is the second legislation on the topic offered by a 2020 candidate this week. Senator Bernie Sanders, one of the top-tier competitors for the 2020 nomination, unveiled a resolution calling for “massive” federal action to reverse the effects of global warming that is also cosponsored by Ocasio-Cortez.
Warren’s Climate Risk Disclosure Act requires companies to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission “critical information” about exposure to climate risks like greenhouse gas emissions and a company’s total amount of fossil-fuel related assets. The bill aims to encourage companies to more quickly switch to more efficient energy sources. Warren originally introduced the bill last year. -- Emma Kinery
Top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates this year bolstered the share of staffers in their Senate offices who are women and minorities, according to a report obtained by Bloomberg News.
Warren, Harris and Sanders all hired more diverse staffers in their congressional offices. Women and minorities are key constituencies for the Democratic nomination and the general election against President Donald Trump next year.
Kamala Harris is briefed by a staff member before speaking on June 1.
Harris hired the most racially diverse workforce of the presidential candidates, with 70% of her office identifying as nonwhite this year, compared with 66% in the same period of 2018 and 61% in 2017. Almost two-thirds of her staff was female, according to the report.
The share of Sanders’ team that identified as a racial minority rose to 28% this year from 18% in 2018. Since 2017, more than 60% of his staff has been women. On Warren’s staff, 48% identified as nonwhite, compared with 36% last year and 34% in 2017. Women represented 59% of her staff this year, compared with 51% last year.
By contrast, Gillibrand saw a slight decline in the share of staffers who are racial minorities. In her office, 46% identified as nonwhite this year, compared with 53% in 2018 and 48% in 2017. She tied with Sanders in hiring women workers, with 63% of the workforce identifying as female.
The majority of New Jersey Senator Cory Booker’s staff -- 61% -- are people of color, though that represents a slight decline from last year.

Harris and Ocasio-Cortez of New York are teaming up to introduce legislation to remove barriers that prevent people with criminal records and their families from obtaining federal housing.
Harris, who’s vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has been criticized for her past work as a prosecutor and for not being as progressive as contenders like Warren or Sanders. Working with the young star of the progressive left to address criminal justice reform could help remedy that perception. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez already have teamed up on two measures.
The Fair Chance at Housing Act would remove the “one-strike” policy, which calls for tenants to be evicted for a single instance of criminal activity, and the “no-fault” policy, where entire families can be evicted because of the actions of a single member.
The bill raises the standard of evidence public housing authorities need when determining whether to screen or evict a tenant. It also bars the use of “suspicion-less drug and alcohol testing” by landlords and public housing authorities. Harris over the weekend announced another housing proposal of a $100 billion program to help African-Americans buy homes. -- Emma Kinery
The Democratic presidential candidates will meet in Houston on Sept. 12 and 13 for the third debate of the 2020 campaign season. Their hosts will be ABC News and Univision, ABC said in a statement on Tuesday night, which added that the format, venue and moderators had yet to be announced.
The first debate, in Miami last month, was in a swing state, as will be the next one, in Detroit on July 30 and 31. Texas, however, remains a solidly red state despite Democratic aspirations to at least turn it purple. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, in a statement announcing the Houston debate, hailed Democratic “victories all across the state.”
But a popular Texas Democrat, Beto O’Rourke, failed to unseat Republican Senator Ted Cruz last November. O’Rourke, of course, is now running for president. -- John Harney
Most of the Democratic presidential candidates are off the trail. Self-help author Marianne Williamson will be in Charlotte, North Carolina; Entrepreneur Andrew Yang will be in Manchester, New Hampshire.

Kim Branson will oversee the use of AI to find novel targets for potential medicines, where Glaxo believes the technology can have the biggest impact, the London-based drugmaker said. Branson is the latest top manager Glaxo has recruited from Roche Holding AG’s Genentech unit, based in San Francisco.
With Emma Walmsley at the helm for the past two years, Glaxo has sought to overhaul its research strategy and change the perception of the company as a laggard in developing cutting-edge drugs. With less than 10% of the industry’s experimental medicines making their way to the market, Glaxo is focusing on new technologies like AI to make prospecting for the next billion-dollar products quicker and more efficient.
“The most impactful way any company will change its performance is making the timelines shorter, the costs lower and the probability of success higher,” Walmsley said in an interview.
The pharma company is tapping AI and machine learning to harness huge amounts of data, trying to predict better targets for potential drugs and the ideal patients for clinical trials. Those technologies provide “a real chance of improving the productivity of an R&D organization,” she said.
Glaxo research chief Hal Barron, a cancer-drug specialist with close links to California’s health and technology sectors, spent 17 years at Genentech and Roche earlier in his career. Since he joined Glaxo in early 2018, the British pharma giant has raised its profile in San Francisco and made key hires among Roche veterans.
Before bringing Branson on board in April, Barron poached Genentech’s Kevin Sin as head of business development for R&D. Shobie Ramakrishnan, who previously worked at drugmakers including Genentech, is now the top digital officer at Glaxo’s pharma unit, the company said.
While companies are using AI in areas from manufacturing to clinical trials, its potential in R&D is generating the most investment and activity as pharma companies seek to boost productivity and cope with rising development costs, according to a report last year from consulting firm Novasecta Ltd. Sanofi last month agreed to collaborate with Alphabet Inc.’s Google to take advantage of its AI and cloud-computing capabilities.
Glaxo already has agreements to collaborate on AI with partners including Exscientia Ltd. Tackling the industry’s low success rate for new drug development, Glaxo last year formed a partnership with genetic-testing company 23andMe Inc. to harness genetic data to find new drug targets and better select patients for clinical studies.

Cisco, whose equipment makes up the backbone of the internet and corporate networks, has recently rekindled growth by revamping existing products and adding new software and services under a corporate makeover by Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins. In May, the company gave a bullish sales and profit forecast for the current period, a sign that corporations continue to spend on computer networks despite the trade dispute between China and the U.S.
“Bringing Acacia’s high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) technologies in-house allows Cisco to better compete with peers, such as Ciena,” said Woo Jin Ho, senior technology analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Acacia’s stock surged 35% to $64.91 Tuesday in New York, while Cisco shares were little changed at $56.34. Cisco’s stock had climbed 30% this year through Monday’s close and has doubled in the past three years. Acacia went public in May 2016 at $23 a share and its stock surged that year to more than $120.
Cisco’s latest acquisition makes chips and machines that help translate optical signals into electronic data. Acacia’s products are used to speed the flow of information around data centers and telecommunication networks.
The new capabilities may help Cisco make more headway selling gear to hyperscale data center owners such as Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, the company said in a presentation. That’s an area where Cisco has struggled to win sales. If it doesn’t grab share in the market for optical systems, the expense of developing the components may prove burdensome and force it to keep selling to Acacia’s existing customers, many of whom are its competitors, according to Dell’Oro Group analyst Jimmy Yu.
During a conference call after the deal’s announcement, analysts questioned whether that will be possible as those competitors may balk at buying from Cisco. Acacia’s customers include Nokia Oyj, Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., and Cisco accounts for about 18% of its revenue, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain analysis.
Bill Gartner, the head of Cisco’s optical business, said the deal allows the companies to more closely integrate their technologies and offer customers simpler solutions.
“We feel like having this technology in-house is the best way to do that,” Gartner said.
Under Robbins, Cisco has made a series of acquisitions aimed at bringing in software and services that will ease the company’s dependence on hardware. He’s trying to build more predictable, recurring revenue by offering customers the ability to remotely manage and monitor their networks in order to make them more efficient and secure.
Robbins has said that transformation will take time as many of the new offerings require customers to shift to newer hardware that will support advanced functions and services.
Cisco’s status as the biggest maker of routers, switches and other gear for connecting computers means its earnings are seen as a broad indicator of corporate spending plans. The company gets only a tiny percentage of sales from China, where it’s been largely locked out of the market, and in one way may be a beneficiary of the ongoing trade dispute, which includes U.S. government attempts to block purchases of equipment from one of its biggest rivals, Huawei Technologies Co. Still, if business spending is hindered by an overall economic slowdown caused by trade uncertainty, Cisco’s sales could feel a hit, analysts have said.

Mallya, the former billionaire who was known as the “King of Good Times” in India, is fighting extradition on fraud charges. He said in court filings for the latest hearing in his extradition battle on Tuesday that he’s been “deliberately set up as the lightning rod of public anger at India’s bad debts” in a process encouraged by leading politicians in the country.
“God is great. Justice prevails,” Mallya, who was previously a lawmaker in India, said on Twitter.
Judges said Mallya could appeal on the grounds that it’s “reasonably arguable” that a lower court judge had wrongly concluded that he had a case to answer, a lawyer for Mallya said. The court dismissed Mallya’s attempt to appeal on other grounds, including that his prosecution in India is politically motivated.
There’s a “real risk” that political pressures “will undermine the fairness of any trial,” Mallya’s lawyers said in court filings for Tuesday’s hearing.
If sent to India, he’d be held in Barrack 12 of Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail, which has seven or eight people in cells designed for six, Mallya said in his filings, citing an Indian lawyer who’s visited the wing. That lawyer said the wing is “unbearably hot in the summer,” doesn’t have enough light for reading and has dust and noise pollution from a large slum area nearby, Mallya argued in his filings. Rats and insects “are visible and have ‘free run in the cells,”’ it said.
The U.K. and Indian governments weren’t represented at Tuesday’s hearing. The London-based High Commission of India didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Mallya was arrested in London in April 2017 after a consortium of 17 banks accused him of willfully defaulting on more than 91 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) in debt accumulated by his Kingfisher Airlines -- a full-service carrier he founded in 2005 and shut down seven years later. A willful defaulter is someone who refuses to repay loans despite having the means to do so.
Mallya offered to pay back dues to banks, employees and other creditors in another Twitter post late on Tuesday. “Please take the money,” he said.
Lower court judge Emma Arbuthnot largely rejected Mallya’s arguments that the case was politically motivated when she ruled in December that he could be sent to India.

The news business is on pace for its worst job losses in a decade as about 3,000 people have been laid off or been offered buyouts in the first five months of this year.
The cuts have been widespread. Newspapers owned by Gannett and McClatchy, digital media companies like BuzzFeed and Vice Media, and the cable news channel CNN have all shed employees.
The level of attrition is the highest since 2009, when the industry saw 7,914 job cuts in the first five months of that year in the wake of the financial crisis, according to data compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an outplacement and executive coaching firm.
The firm’s tally is based on news reports of buyouts and layoffs, and includes downsizing at printing operations and advertising and tech executives at Verizon Media Group, home of HuffPost and Yahoo, which announced in January that it was laying off about 800 employees.
About 88,000 people worked in U.S. newsrooms in 2017, according to Pew Research Center.
With the U.S. unemployment rate the lowest since 1969, the journalism job market is one of the rare weak spots, said Andrew Challenger, the firm’s vice president.
“In most industries, employers can’t find enough people to fill the jobs they have open,” he said. “In news, it has been the opposite story. And it seems to have been accelerating.”
The cuts have created a competitive job market where the number of out-of-work journalists often exceeds the number of openings. When Bklyner, a local news site in Brooklyn, said in May it was looking for a new political reporter, 16 journalists emailed their resumes within a few hours, said Liena Zagare, Bklyner’s editor and publisher. Many had prior work experience at national media outlets such as CNN, Reuters and New York Magazine.
“I was looking at my inbox like, ‘Oh my goodness,’” Zagare said in an interview. “It was beyond what I’ve seen before ⁠— the kind of people looking to work for us and the speed that their applications were coming in. To me, it was incredibly depressing. It says something about this industry that we can’t employ these people.”

There are a few reasons for the job losses. Local newspapers have seen much of their advertising revenue vanish as readers move online. They’ve also struggled to attract many digital subscribers after past rounds of layoffs and buyouts eroded their quality. Digital media startups, funded by venture capitalists seeking growth, aggressively hired journalists then scaled back to focus on profitability. Almost everyone is struggling to compete with Facebook and Google, which accounted for three-fourths of U.S. online ads sales last year.
The job instability in online media is one reason for the wave of unionizing across the landscape. At Vox Media, home of websites like the Verge and Eater, a new union contract ensures that employees get a minimum of 11 weeks of severance pay if they get laid off.
In January, John Stanton, a former Washington bureau chief for BuzzFeed News, was one of about 250 people cut from the company. In June, he helped start a nonprofit called the Save Journalism Project, which calls attention to how tech giants like Facebook and Google are threatening newsrooms by dominating the online advertising market.
So far, the group has published op-eds in newspapers, launched an advertising campaign and flown a plane over a Google conference with a banner that read “#savelocalnews.”
“We’re trying to get our colleagues to speak up,” Stanton said. “We need to protect ourselves or we’re not going to have jobs.”
Many BuzzFeed journalists who were laid off in January are still looking for full-time work, he said. Several are freelancing, in some cases writing 1,000-word articles that pay about $400 and take a week to complete. “The pay freelancers get is completely inadequate,” Stanton said.
While tech giants are often blamed for the news industry’s financial troubles, they have also become a destination for journalists who want to leave the field. Amazon is hiring editors to cover local crime news for a division of its security-focused doorbell, Ring. Facebook, Apple, Snapchat and Google have all hired journalists in recent years to work on their media-related initiatives.
The journalism job hunt can be particularly challenging between the coasts. Last year, Emma Roller, 30, took a buyout after working as a politics writer for the website Splinter, which was part of Univision’s Gizmodo Media Group. She got married and moved from Washington to Chicago to be closer to family. But as she looked for a new job, she found many positions required that she live in New York, Washington or Los Angeles.
“All of media has become concentrated in three cities,” said Roller, who now works part-time at an elementary school and as a barista at a coffee shop while freelancing. “I chose to move away from where journalism jobs are. But at the same time it’s a structural problem.”
Journalism schools say enrollment is up, despite the dark headlines about the industry, and they are adjusting their curriculum to prepare students for in-demand jobs. The University of Maryland expects 44 graduate journalism students this fall, up from 32 last year. The school has started requiring students take more audio reporting classes because “this generation seems to love podcasts,” said Lucy Dalglish, dean of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism.
Some news outlets are growing. The Los Angeles Times has added about 100 employees to its editorial staff since billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong bought the newspaper last June. The Washington Post announced recently it is adding 10 people to its investigative team.
But for some journalists, even winning national awards is not enough to help make ends meet. More than two years ago, Chris Outcalt took a chance on a job at a startup that wanted to launch a technology news website. But the team was laid off before it got off the ground. So Outcalt began freelancing.
In June, Outcalt won a Livingston Award, a prestigious prize given to journalists under the age of 35. Yet he’s still searching for a full-time job. In the meantime, he’s started working part-time as a bartender at a craft brewery in Denver to help pay the bills.
“I’m often thinking about whether I’ll be able to hang on until I find something a little more stable — something, say, that provides health insurance,” Outcalt said. “Certainly no one becomes a journalist to get rich. But I also can’t imagine there are that many people who would want to enter a challenging profession that also requires you to tend bar two nights a week.”"

Peter Barbey’s great-grandfather John started the Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Co. 120 years ago. Known today as the VF Corp., it owns outdoorsy brands like Timberland and North Face. In its last fiscal year, VF reported nearly $14 billion in revenue and $1.5 billion in net income. Its market cap hovers around $35 billion. The Barbeys, who still own around 20 percent of the company, are very rich.
Barbey, 62, went to the University of Arizona. He met his wife, Pam, there. They planted roots in Phoenix, where he invested in commercial real estate while also running the city’s most beloved independent bookstore, Houle Books. But in 2011, Peter and Pam moved to Reading, Pennsylvania, to take charge of another property that had been in the Barbey, DuPont and Flippin families for over a century: the Reading Eagle. With a Sunday circulation over 70,000, a team of sports writers as good as any in Pennsylvania, and a news staff that took seriously its watchdog role, the Eagle was one of the best medium-sized newspapers in the state, if not the country.
When I asked Barbey recently how he felt about leaving behind his life in Arizona to become president of the Eagle, he shrugged. “I’d been on the board since 2000,” he said. “I knew the company well. And I felt it was my duty to my family’s legacy, and to this community, to take this on.”
Eight years later, the Barbey, DuPont and Flippin families no longer own the Reading Eagle. In May, the paper was sold to MediaNews Group Inc., the newspaper company owned by the hedge fund Alden Global Capital LLC, which has a well-deserved reputation for asset stripping and layoffs. Barbey cared deeply about the Eagle; he sold it with great reluctance, helpless to reverse the paper’s economic decline.
You sometimes hear journalists saying that if only their paper’s owner had beefed up the staff, had given reporters more time to do better stories, had made the paper indispensable to its community, maybe the economic decline of the paper could have been averted. What is instructive — and discouraging — about the Reading Eagle is that is exactly what Barbey did. He bet that good journalism could keep the Eagle solvent. And he bet wrong.
“It was like playing a game of chess where you just run out of moves,” said Barbey when I met him recently in New York.
By the time Barbey became the chief executive of the Reading Eagle Co. 
            

                1
            
         in 2011, it was far from the immensely profitable paper it had once been. Classified ads were long gone, done in by Craigslist and its imitators. But local grocery stores, drugstores and car dealerships were still advertisers. Circulation was declining, but not disastrously so. And though the Eagle was losing money, the losses were small.
A few years earlier, the company had bought a new press capable of printing magazines as well as a newspaper. One of Barbey’s first moves was to start a publication about rural Berks County that subscribers received as a weekly insert. (He also started a regional business magazine.) It quickly became popular. Small advertisers flocked to it. “It made good money,” Barbey recalls. “Better than the internet.”
He also began beefing up the news staff. He hired an investigative reporter, Ford Turner, from the Patriot-News in Harrisburg, and set him loose. Turner wrote a series of hard-hitting investigative stories. The Eagle covered the opioid crisis, which had hit Berks County hard. And he gave the editors the go-ahead to hire a dozen or more young, ambitious journalists. “Peter believed very strongly that he could make print work,” said Garry Lenton, who joined the Eagle in 2012, and became the editor in 2018.
For a while, it seemed as though he was making print work. Although the decline in circulation and advertising revenue never completely stopped, it slowed considerably. The company became cash-flow-positive for the first time in years. Morale among the news staff was high, as reporters realized that their boss was counting on the Eagle’s journalism to pull the paper through. “The newsroom was doing it,” Barbey told me. “We felt we were really competing.”
Yet it all started to fall apart in 2016. Barbey can’t explain why that was when his formula stopped working; he just knows it was.  Quarterly circulation declines accelerated. And as circulation declined, so did the Eagle’s ad revenue. In 2017 the grocery stores stopped printing inserts in the Eagle and switched to direct mail.  The drugstores stopped advertising, as did the car dealers. Painfully, many of the small advertisers that had once flocked to the Berks County magazine left as well. “It was one blow to the solar plexus after another,” says Lenton.
Lenton was then running the Eagle’s digital side. He recalls going to the salesperson who solicited ads for the magazine. “The man said, ‘I don’t know what’s going on. I can’t figure out this market anymore.’”
But it wasn’t that hard to figure out. Both the Eagle’s subscribers and its advertisers were gravitating to the internet, especially Facebook. Using Facebook, advertisers could target Reading consumers for a fraction of what an ad cost in the Eagle. Subscribers, realizing that they could get all the Reading news they needed via Facebook, stopped paying $180 a year for the newspaper.
Here was the worst part. Even though the Eagle had a paywall, many readers were still able to access its articles via the internet without paying the newspaper a penny. And there wasn’t a thing Barbey could do about it.
For this, he blames the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which exempts platforms like Google and Facebook from direct copyright infringement. The result is that readers can create their own newspaper, using, say, their Facebook newsfeed, without ever paying a newspaper for its content.
“When they passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, why didn’t they think this would happen?” Barbey asked.
Barbey’s job changed from trying to grow his operation to trying to staunch the bleeding. The business staff was reduced though layoffs. Barbey protected the newsroom, though when journalists left or retired they weren’t replaced. The Eagle pushed hard to generate digital subscriptions. But with the cost to subscribers a mere $7 a month, digital subscriptions didn’t make much of a dent. Between 2016 and 2018, ad revenue dropped from $17 million to $12.6 million, while the company’s losses went from less than $1 million to $4 million.
Finally, in May 2018, the Eagle eliminated 13 newsroom positions. The Eagle still had more than 60 journalists, but the handwriting was on the wall. “I started getting invoices from the wire services that were 30 or 60 days late, and they were threatening to cut us off,” says Lenton, who took over as editor in 2018. “I would have to go to the accounting department and tell them they really had to pay this one.”
The Eagle had one last moment of glory: It was named the 2018 Newspaper of the Year by the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association. But in March 2019,  a year after those first newsroom layoffs, the Reading Eagle Co. filed for bankruptcy. In the bankruptcy filing, the company said that the only way it could stem the losses would be to make large cuts in the newsroom, which “cannot bear millions more in cuts.”
Although a number of companies kicked the Eagle’s tires, Alden Global soon emerged as the only serious bidder. The hedge fund owns other papers in Pennsylvania and can consolidate business-side functions. And, of course, Alden Global is never going to sweat layoffs the way Barbey did — ruthless cost-cutting is at the heart of its business model.
As our interview was coming to a close, I asked Barbey what lesson he drew from his experience running the Eagle. Without hesitation, he replied, “You can’t write your way out of this.” A big national paper like the New York Times might be able to revive its fortunes by going all-in on digital, but that won’t work for a mid-sized paper like the Eagle. You can’t make enough money from digital subscriptions or ads to turn a profit. And paywall or no paywall, the Eagle’s content was too easy to find online.
Although Alden Global laid off 81 employees soon after it bought the Eagle, both Barbey and Lenton say that the hedge fund has not hollowed out the newsroom. The Eagle, they say, is still putting out a good paper every day.
But as they also both now know, putting out a good paper just isn’t enough anymore. On Monday, the top of the Eagle’s homepage featured six stories. This was one of them: “Phone lines are down at Reading Eagle offices.”

This won’t be your father’s recession -- if indeed the U.S. ends up tumbling into one.
Traditionally, U.S. downturns are home-grown and household-led, triggered by spikes in interest rates and fueled by the unwinding of financial and economic excesses. None of that is arguably at work this time, at least for now.
Instead, what’s making investors nervous about a recession is a global, geopolitical shock to business sentiment that’s prompting U.S. companies to curb spending amid uncertainties from the U.S.-China trade war to Britain’s potential pullout from the European Union.
“The global economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to cut capacity,’’ FedEx Corp. Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said in a Sept. 17 conference call. The slowdown is being “driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty.’’
The World Trade Organization cuts the outlook for global commerce 
Data: WTO


That poses problems for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policy makers as they decide whether to cut interest rates later this month for the third time this year.
The unusual nature of the forces at play -- and the fact that many of them are geopolitical and emanate from abroad -- makes it more difficult for policy makers to decide how far to go in easing credit.
There’s even a question of how effective rate cuts will be in an economy where business executives fear such dire developments as the breakup of global supply chains.
Powell is expected to deliver his latest thinking on the outlook when he speaks to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver at 2:30 p.m. U.S. East Coast time on Tuesday. He said last week that despite some risks, the U.S. economy is in a “good place,’’ and that the Fed’s job is “to keep it there.’’
If business pessimism turns out to be overdone, there’s even a chance the economy could snap back as companies rev up outlays and monetary stimulus kicks in with greater force.
“The scenarios are quite extreme,’’ JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman said. “Either we bend and then break or we bend and then bounce.’’
A study by IHS Markit’s Macroeconomic Advisers calculated that gross domestic product could be boosted by roughly 0.5% if uncertainty over trade policy ultimately dissipates.
Negotiators from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet on Thursday for the first high-level talks since July, though hopes of a breakthrough are not high.
Moody’s Analytics Inc. chief economist Mark Zandi said a recession is all but inevitable if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs on virtually all U.S. imports from China by the end of this year.
Such a move would probably rock financial markets and hurt the economy, said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank Securities. In the event that happened, he said the odds of a downturn would rise to 50-50.
Some other analysts are not as pessimistic. Former International Monetary Fund chief economist Maury Obstfeld said a ratcheting up of tariffs on China would likely lead to slower growth, but not a recession.
“I just don’t see what would set off a broad contraction in activity,’’ said Obstfeld, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

That’s because many of the traditional drivers of downturns seem to missing in action:
“The consumer right now in the U.S., at least in terms of our business, is doing really well,” Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer for PepsiCo Inc. said in a recent interview.
“You have a lot of trouble identifying what the trigger would be for a recession in the U.S., especially a deep one,’’ said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist for Citigroup Inc. “That makes us feel a little less concerned.’’
He put the chances of a recession over the next 12 months at about 30%.
Veteran forecaster Allen Sinai said the current situation reminds him of the lead-up to the 1990-91 recession. Companies back then responded to a profit squeeze from rising wages by cutting back spending and hiring.
This time it is slowing sales abroad that could prompt U.S. companies to pull back, said Sinai, president of Decision Economics Inc.
He said the lesson from the earlier period is that the Fed needs to respond aggressively and preemptively to the danger of a recession.
The trouble is that the outlook is far from clear.
Some risks, like Brexit, have yet to materialize. Others, like the U.S.-China tit-for-tat tariffs, have soured business sentiment but only recently begun to crimp output.
“We are having a hard time judging how large this geopolitical shock is,’’ said JPMorgan’s Kasman, who reckons that the odds of a recession over the next 12 months are 35% to 40%.

The 120-acre site, called “The Enchanted Hill,” is listed at $110 million, down from $150 million a year ago. The property is one of the largest undeveloped sites in the 90210 ZIP code, offers city and mountain views, and is minutes from Rodeo Drive.
The price cut is part of a “rebranding effort,” said Jesse Lally of Beverly Hills-based brokerage Hilton & Hyland, one of the four listing agents for the property. The site has five flat lots that could be used for a single-family home -- albeit one with guest houses, tennis and basketball courts, and a wellness center, he said. The other option is to subdivide the land for as many as 15 homes.
The new owner could “create the newest, hippest gated community, like a Beverly Park or Mulholland Estates,” Lally said, referring to other upscale residential developments in the area. Four individuals have already expressed interest in developing their own gated community, he added.
Paul Allen
The site was named “The Enchanted Hill” by Hollywood legend Greta Garbo for her silent-film industry friends and neighbors, Frances Marion and Fred Thomson, who first discovered the hilltop property in the early 1920s, according to the listing.
The Beverly Hills property had changed hands twice before it was sold to Allen, who paid $20 million in 1997. After the purchase, he tore down structures that included a Spanish colonial-style house that was built by Marion and Thomson, Variety reported, and installed two gated entrances and built a one-mile private street.
“When you go through the Angelo gate, you arrive right at the main site,” Lally said. “If you go through the other gate, it’s a very romantic pretty drive through Los Angeles nature.”
Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, died a year ago at 65. He amassed a $26 billion fortune with investments in sports teams, art and startups, in addition to real estate, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The holdings were managed through his family office, Vulcan Inc., which today is run by his sister, Jody Allen.
“The Enchanted Hill” isn’t the only asset owned by the late billionaire that’s up for sale. His estate is also trying to sell his 414-foot super yacht, “Octopus.” It’s available for 295 million euros ($324 million) through yacht brokers Fraser & Burgess. Capable of scientific research voyages, Octopus was designed to venture into remote places. It’s also hosted rockers U2 and Mick Jagger.
The superyacht ’Octopus’.
Allen’s estate owns the National Football League’s Seattle Seahawks and the National Basketball Association’s Portland Trail Blazers, which are worth a combined $3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Allen had no spouse or children to inherit his empire, but at least half his assets were probably earmarked for charitable purposes after he joined the Giving Pledge.

But it’s not the Donald Trump impeachment scandal involving Biden’s son that’s doing it.
The former vice president is being tested by the collective toll of age, verbal blunders and a contrast with Elizabeth Warren’s dramatic plans to overhaul government. Trump’s attempts to tarnish him with scandal have yet to make a dent with Democratic voters -- and heightens the Biden campaign’s argument that the president fears him most in a general election.
Nationally, Biden’s support has stayed between 26% and 32% since late June, and polls taken after the Ukraine-Trump scandal broke show no clear drop in support. In a Monmouth University poll out Tuesday, 65% of Democrats said Biden probably didn’t pressure Ukraine not to investigate his son’s business work there, while 19% said he probably did.
But Biden didn’t need a brush of scandal to see his numbers start to drop. His lead in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to pick a nominee evaporated before last week’s bombshell. Polls there show Warren jumping to a statistical tie, or slightly ahead.
Democrats began an impeachment inquiry against Trump for repeatedly asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to “look into” Biden and his son Hunter.
Trump and his campaign have spent at least $10 million so far on ads suggesting that Biden intervened on his son’s behalf to fire a top Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into Burisma Holdings, an energy company that included the younger Biden on its board.
Earlier: Biden Tries to Defend Electability Against Trump Ukraine Assault
Biden, as vice president in the Obama administration, did join European countries and other entities in urging Ukraine to fire the prosecutor as a condition of foreign aid. But the probe into Burisma had been dormant for more than a year at that time.
“Honestly, the biggest challenges for Biden are the timidity of his ‘Make America 2015 Again’ vision, his record on everything from financial reform to criminal justice, and his uneven — at best — performance on the trail,” said Neil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy For America, a liberal activist group hasn’t endorsed a 2020 candidate.
For Biden, 76, who has been in public office for 44 years, it’s a natural hazard of running to represent a party that is becoming younger, less white and more female. Warren’s pitch to remake the political and economic system has struck a chord with voters hungry for major change. Biden’s message, by contrast, is to “restore the soul” of America.
Central to Biden’s pitch is that he’s the most likely of the 2020 field to defeat Trump and win back Midwestern swing voters who abandoned Democrats last cycle. Having Trump go after him -- risking removal from office to do so -- only strengthens that argument.
“Donald Trump is so terrified he’d lose that struggle to Joe Biden that he just sent his administration into a tailspin by trying to force a foreign country to spread a universally-debunked, right-wing conspiracy theory,” Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in an e-mail.

Jennifer Panozzo, a 52-year-old retiree from Las Vegas, said Biden is her top choice, but Warren is a close second.
“I like the stability and knowing what he stands for,” she said.

A new CNN poll of Nevada, the third contest on Feb. 22, found Biden tied with Bernie Sanders for the lead with Warren close behind.
Two recent polls of South Carolina Democrats, by CNN and Winthrop University, found Biden with a commanding lead over rivals powered by a dominant showing among the state’s majority-black primary electorate. In both surveys, Warren was about 20 points behind in second place.
Holding that edge with black voters is paramount, and only possible if they continue to believe he can beat Trump, which surveys show is a top priority.
But some of Biden’s backers worry about his durability.
“My concern is that I worry about anyone older than me,” said Fred Hurst, a 70-year-old retiree from Las Vegas. “I have some concerns about his ability to hold out.”
Rival Pete Buttigieg, 37, has been subtly jabbing at Biden’s age in Iowa. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has raised $51 million in six months and is trying to siphon moderate Democrats from Biden.

Warren, 70, is attracting a mix of left-wing voters and mainstream Democrats who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 — a group that is key to Biden’s prospects.
Biden’s core strength — a belief among Democrats that he’s the best bet to defeat Trump — could fade if he performs poorly in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Earlier: Pelosi’s Impeachment Move Takes Democrats on Leap Into Dark
“He’s still the front-runner, but barely,” said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant. “It’s really hard to win the nomination on a premise of electability if you’re going to go 0 for 2, or 0 for 3.”
Biden’s supporters believe Trump’s attacks could help the former vice president by rallying Democrats to his side.
Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa and Obama agriculture secretary who has not yet endorsed a candidate, said he’s been pleased with Biden’s handling of the Trump attacks. Biden has refused to be drawn into any debates about him and his son and has focused squarely on Trump.
“What I have heard is that people are impressed he hasn’t take the bait,” Vilsack said.
He added: “You need to know how someone is going to react not just to the best days of the campaign but to the worst days of the campaign. Vice President Biden has showed how he would react. No other candidate has really had to respond to a situation like that.”
Sroka said the Ukraine story isn’t a Biden scandal. But he still worries it may hurt the party.
“The Ukraine scandal does give Trump the ability to muddy the waters,” he said. “We saw what Trump did to Clinton on the emails in 2016, and, even if we know there’s even less of an issue here than there was there, it runs the real risk of being deja vu all over again.”

Also Marcus, Overstock, David Shaw and WeWork.
The simplest weirdest thing about the  spike in repo rates two weeks ago is that there was a day when big banks could borrow money at around 2%, unsecured, overnight, and lend it out overnight, secured by Treasuries, for at least 5%, maybe as high as 10%. On Sept. 17, overnight Libor, a measure of banks’ unsecured borrowing costs, was about 2.15%, up from about 2.11% the day before
            

                1
            
        ; the federal funds effective rate, another measure of unsecured bank borrowing, was 2.30%, up from 2.25% the day before. Meanwhile the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a broad measure of the cost of repo, that is, overnight borrowing secured by Treasuries, was at 5.25%, up from 2.43% the day before. The 99th percentile SOFR borrower paid 9%, and rates as high as 10% were reported. The cost of unsecured borrowing for banks went up a little; the cost of secured borrowing against Treasuries shot up a lot.
The world should not work that way: If big rational financial actors have the capacity to borrow at 2% and lend risk-free at 5% or 10%, they should do that all day long, but really they should only be able to do it for a few minutes until the rates converge. Like there’s a lot of money over here, not enough money over there, you connect a pipe between them and collect a fee until the amounts level out, I don’t know, this is kind of how finance works.
But that’s not how it worked on Sept. 17, and repo rates only got back to normal (SOFR on Friday was 1.82%, versus 1.83% for fed funds and 1.83% for Libor
            

                2
            
        ) after the Federal Reserve intervened by setting up its own pipe and lending in the repo market. A lot of people have talked about a lot of causes for this, and I will list some here as long as you promise not to email me to say “you are missing the most important cause which is that Freedonia’s central bank was liquidating its Bitcoin portfolio” or whatever. Post-crisis  liquidity regulation, and real economic needs for liquidity, have made it more important for banks to hang on to their money, so they might not want to lend out money even at very attractive rates. Leverage regulation has made it more important for big banks not to borrow, so they might not want to borrow to get more money to lend out at very attractive rates. The repo market is much bigger than the fed funds market, so if you actually tried to suck money from fed funds to repo you would quickly use it all up. “Banks” in common usage are actually bank holding companies, and the actual banks that do the borrowing have limits on their ability to move money over to their affiliated broker-dealers that do the lending. Lots of other stuff too; the essential nature of the problem involves the absence of a pipe where a pipe should be, which means that its explanation will be sort of specific and finicky and plumbing-related. 
But here I want to abstract away from that stuff and just focus on the big simple weird thing—that during the repo spike banks could still borrow at 2% even as they were lending at 5 or 10%—and what it tells you. One very very simple thing that it tells you, one that I am almost embarrassed to mention here because it is so obvious, is that the repo spike was not an indication of a crisis for banks. The fact that the big banks could, at the height of the repo spike, borrow unsecured—without collateral, based only on their own financial strength—at around 2% means that investors just were not particularly worried that banks were running into trouble. The repo spike was bad for (some) hedge funds and non-bank broker-dealers, people who fund themselves in the repo market and don’t have access to bank-type borrowing. But the banks were fine.
“Fine” isn’t quite the word. The second thing to notice is that the repo spike was an indication of a big opportunity for banks. Like, sure, the fact that banks could borrow at 2% and lend at 10% was not arbitraged away, which means that not enough banks were doing it, but the fact that those rates printed means that somebody was doing it. Bloomberg’s Yalman Onaran and Shahien Nasiripour report that one of those somebodies was JPMorgan:
Never mind unsecured borrowing: Banks could lend money to hedge funds or dealers at 5 or 10%, secured by Treasuries, and then turn around and borrow against those Treasuries from money market funds at 3 or 4%, the purest sort of pipe-connecting transaction. The money market funds mostly can’t lend directly to the hedge funds or dealers,
            

                3
            
         but the banks can connect them and take a (generally) tiny or (occasionally) gigantic cut.
The third thing to notice here is that, despite this being a big opportunity for banks, they mostly didn’t take advantage of it. Some did, somewhat, but the arbitrage got nowhere close to closing, meaning that banks left a whole lot of money on the table. Partly that is for regulatory reasons: Liquidity and leverage rules limited the banks’ ability to lend out the money they had or borrow more. Partly it is for genuine liquidity-risk-management reasons: Banks need to keep money around to settle customer transactions and so are hesitant to lend all of it.
            

                4
            
         Partly it is for sort of operational muscle-memory reasons: They forgot that this is the sort of opportunity they are supposed to seize, and how to seize it. “There are no more fed funds desks at the big banks, and the Fed staff who used to keep the wheels of the market greased are no longer there,” Glenn Havlicek tells Onaran and Nasiripour. “So when there was a funding spike, nobody remembered what to do.”
This mostly seems like a straightforwardly bad result: Markets should clear, money should move from low-value to high-value uses, banks are in the business of making that happen, and if they can’t do it then they are not doing their job and something is broken. And in particular, overnight lending secured by Treasuries is about the safest business a bank can be in, so bank-safety regulation that (1) prevents banks from doing that and (2) breaks that market is probably unhelpful. 
But I tend to think about the post-financial-crisis rules mainly from a cultural perspective of “have they succeeded in making banks boring?” If they have, that is not at all an unalloyed good: If banks are too boring then they will not be doing their jobs effectively, and markets might get more exciting (and scary) to make up the difference, and also of course I will have less fun stuff to write about. But banking boredom does seem to me to be the central intended consequence of post-2008 regulation. And if you want boring banks then the repo spike is almost something to celebrate: The market went haywire and created opportunities for banks to make a profit, and they mostly passed on it because (1) the rules told them not to take risks, (2) their own internal requirements told them not to take risks, and (3) they forgot how to take risks. 
Let’s say you want to borrow money and aren’t sure if you are going to pay it back. Like you’re borrowing it to do something risky, and if the risk doesn’t pan out you won’t be able to repay it; or maybe you just don’t know if, when the time comes, you will feel like paying it back. Usually if you borrow money and don’t pay it back, the lender will come after you for the money, but different lenders will do that with different levels of aggressiveness. If you borrow money from your parents and don’t pay it back, they will occasionally drop awkward hints at family gatherings; if you borrow from a bank and don’t pay it back, they might seek to garnish your wages or put liens on your property; you probably know enough not to borrow from the Mafia and not pay it back. In general if you are having doubts about your future ability or desire to repay, you should choose a lender who won’t come after you very hard.
Where do you think Goldman Sachs Group Inc. falls on this range? Naively you might think that the “great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity” would be closer to the Mafia than your parents, but nope! The delightful answer is, or at least was for a while, that in Goldman’s consumer-facing Marcus business they were absolute pussycats and figured that if you didn’t pay them back you had troubles of your own and they didn’t want to bother you. No I’m kidding, they were absolute pussycats because they figured that if they did bother you that would look bad for Goldman, and enough things looked bad enough for Goldman that your money wasn’t worth it:
If you were able to game this out in advance—if you were like “I’m gonna borrow $10,000 from Goldman and not pay it back, because the bad publicity of pursuing me will deter them from doing anything”—then, one, congratulations on your $10,000, but, two, send them a resume, because really you should be working at Goldman. Not in the consumer business either; they could use a bond trader with instincts like yours.
The arbitrage has closed now, and Marcus “has dedicated collections staff that is specially trained, a spokesman said.” I hope they're specially trained to leave a dead squid on your doorstep. (Kidding, mostly.) Disclosure, I used to work at Goldman, in the pre-Marcus days when we mostly tried to get paid back. 
Two of my favorite themes around here are (1) that everything is securities fraud and (2) that the goings-on at Overstock.com Inc. are pretty bananas, so it is nice to see them combined in one story:
Here is the complaint, on behalf of a class of Overstock shareholders. As we have  discussed a  few  times, Overstock declared a special stock dividend payable in shares of its blockchain-based “Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock,” which would be tradable only on its own blockchain platform and not tradable at all for its first six months. Eventually the market realized that this would be a big problem for short sellers, who would be obligated to deliver shares of the blockchain stock to their securities lenders and who wouldn’t be able to find any. This led to a short squeeze that drove up Overstock’s stock price, as short sellers capitulated and bought in the stock. Then this squeeze deflated, as brokers agreed to accept cash in lieu of the Series A-1 stock, and as people started asking questions about whether declaring a weird blockchain dividend to cause a short squeeze might be manipulative. Overstock backed down, and the dividend was delayed and will now be freely tradable immediately. Also separately from all of this Byrne resigned as CEO to spend more time blogging about his  relationship with a Russian spy. 
Anyway if … that … happens … is that securities fraud? Oh I don’t know. The narrower questions are like (1) did Overstock announce its weird blockchain dividend for the purpose of engineering a short squeeze and (2) if it did, would that be a fraud? Specifically, would it be a fraud on people who bought Overstock stock at inflated prices during the short squeeze? From the complaint:
Oh yeah I forgot to mention that Byrne sold his stock in the middle of all this, the whole thing is so nuts. The best part is that Byrne is named as a defendant, and I have a hard time seeing him quietly settling to make this go away, so there is a real chance that the case will go to trial in the most over the top, I’m-not-out-of-order-the-whole-system-is-out-of-order sort of way.
This New York Magazine/Propublica article about hedge-fund billionaire David Shaw’s alleged method for getting his kids into college is really something, or honestly a lot of things. For one thing, there is a gossipy account of how Shaw’s “highly compensated, Ivy-educated, hierarchical” household staff works. There is the odd irony that Shaw’s wife, Beth Kobliner, is a personal-finance advice writer.
The college-admissions method itself is pretty straightforward, though; you just donate a million dollars a year to a bunch of top colleges and figure your kids have to get into one of them. (It helps that the kids seem to be smart and high-achieving.) The article emphasizes the portfolio approach (“from a hedge funder’s perspective, investing in multiple colleges is a classic asymmetric bet,” “he’s hedging his bets,” etc.), and, fine, but to me the most interesting part was the pricing. Specifically the tiers of pricing:
Ouch, for Brown! (Kobliner went there, and Shaw got his Ph.D. at Stanford; neither of them went to any of the other schools.) Also what is that bump for Columbia, which came after Shaw’s second child started at Yale? Are they worried that the third will need more of a backup plan? “We had to increase our annual gift to Columbia after your brother got into Yale” sounds to me like an amazingly subtle expression of billionaire parental disappointment.
The best line in the story, though, goes to Jules Feiffer, which is both unsurprising (he’s Jules Feiffer!) and surprising (what is he doing here?). It comes in a paragraph full of great lines:
So are Harvard and Yale, to be fair.
Meanwhile here’s a Bloomberg story about how “WeWork Was a Family Affair” in which co-founder Adam Neumann and his wife and nominal co-founder Rebekah Neumann “don’t have a line at all between work and life,” as she put it in 2016. “It’s not even a blurred line. There is no line.” She is no longer with the company, and he is no longer chief executive officer, largely for that reason. A sampling:
Yes, another way to provide for your children’s education is to just have the tech startup you control build a school for them. Doesn’t Shaw’s plan seem so pedestrian and unambitious and old-economy, compared to this? If WeWork’s initial public offering had gone a bit better then in like 11 years it would spend a few billion dollars to build its own Yale.
Meanwhile, “WeWork is  formally withdrawing the prospectus for its scrapped initial public offering, capping a botched effort to go public that cost its top executive his job.” And Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital Inc. is “selling nearly all of its traditional holdings and channeling the money into property that focuses on the tech sector.” So it’s pivoting from real estate to tech? Maybe WeWork could try that, hahaha kidding sorry.

Also other IPOs troubles, Mylan, non-GAAP accounting and Overstock.
At some point they should change the name, right? The We Co., formerly known as WeWork,  postponed its initial public offering just 11 days ago in the face of emphatic investor pushback, and since then it has been working with really quite astonishing speed to change everything about itself that investors don’t like. Controversial co-founder and chief executive officer Adam Neumann is  no longer CEO, though he’s still non-executive chairman, and his super-voting stock has been cut back from 20 votes per share to 3. His wife and co-founder Rebekah Neumann, who ran We’s experimental-school division (WeGrow),  is out, and the school might be on the chopping block. Several other businesses are  also up for sale; the bankers who thought they’d be closing an IPO by now are instead scrambling to sell an events business and an office-management company. There are plans “to purge nearly 20 friends and family members of Mr. Neumann,” including  the vice chairman and the chief product officer, and thousands of layoffs are contemplated. To save cash, WeWork won’t sign any new leases, meaning that its rapid growth will pause. They’re selling the private jet. 
If you didn’t like We two weeks ago, when it was a fast-growing money-burning startup run by a charismatic founder-CEO who had lots of whimsical side projects in a bid to “encompass all aspects of people’s lives,” maybe you’ll like We now that it’s a fast-shrinking money-hoarding startup run by two professional co-CEOs who are frantically paring the side projects to focus on the core business of renting out office space for more than they pay for it. Or maybe you won’t; maybe you just don’t like the business of office-landlord intermediation, or don’t think that We can do it sustainably with good margins.
            

                1
            
         But really it seems to me that pretty much every public-investor complaint about We that could be addressed, every problem that was fixable rather than intrinsic, is being addressed.
Except the name. Next week they’ll probably announce that it’s called Coworkr. Deskbook. United Workspaces. Amalgamated Furnished Office Rentals Inc. Also they’ll  charge Neumann $6 million for changing the name back.
Honestly it is sort of a bizarre triumph of corporate governance; I cannot think of a public company that has ever changed so quickly and comprehensively to respond to shareholder concerns. Well, not shareholder concerns. Sort of by definition the people who objected to WeWork are people who don’t currently own shares. Potential shareholder concerns. I guess that’s an important difference. It turns out you have a lot more leverage before you buy shares than after.
Sometimes. My basic model of modern tech-industry corporate governance is that scalable world-dominating ideas are rare and capital is plentiful, so when an entrepreneur invents the next Facebook, or even the next Uber, she has all the leverage: Investors will compete to give her money at high valuations and founder-friendly terms, and she can demand perpetual control of her company even while taking billions of dollars of outside capital. But even if that is the right model as a general matter, there are, you know, some parameters. Capital is plentiful, but it is not infinite, and founders of companies that require tens of billions of dollars to scale in capital-intensive, competitive, high-marginal-cost businesses might not have the same negotiating leverage as their pure-tech counterparts. They really need the money! The people with the money can make some demands.
There’s a reason that the founders of Uber and WeWork are the ones who were pushed out by their boards before going public, even though both of them controlled their companies through super-voting stock. Super-voting stock is a strong insulator of founder control as long as the company has money, but if you need to go back to investors for more money, those super-votes can always be renegotiated. “So all the agreements and such are only as solid as the performance of the business,” comments Fred Wilson. “When WeWork’s directors voted on Tuesday to oust Adam Neumann as chief executive after a failed attempt to take the office-sharing startup public, Neumann cast his vote against himself,” reports Reuters. 
It is  a bloodbath, huh? Exercise-bike startup Peloton Interactive Inc. priced its IPO at the top of its marketing range and  cracked immediately: It priced at $29 Wednesday evening, opened yesterday at $27, and closed at $25.76. Endeavor Group Holdings Inc.  pulled its IPO just before pricing after seeing how Peloton traded. This comes two weeks after  SmileDirectClub Inc. priced its IPO above the marketing range and then fell 28% on its first day of trading, and it is all in the shadow of underwhelming IPOs by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. earlier this year. Also of course WeWork.
I don’t know what to tell you other than that the “people are worried about unicorns” narrative turned out to be boringly, straightforwardly correct. A lot of big tech and tech-identifying companies were able to raise a lot of money at very high valuations from enthusiastic and often non-traditional private investors, but then it turned out that the public markets did not share the private markets’ enthusiasm, or their valuations. There was a localized bubble in private tech valuations, and it bumped against the sharp edge of the public markets, and it popped. This doesn’t mean that every highly valued tech company that hasn’t gone public yet is doomed, but it does mean that private investors got a little too indiscriminate with their investing and will now have to take losses on the duds. And that fast-growing money-losing capital-intensive businesses probably will not have the same appeal to private investors as they used to:
To be fair there is a difference between “fledgling companies” and “startups,” at least in modern usage. WeWork is a “startup” in the sense that (1) it is private, (2) it is venture-backed, (3) it calls itself a tech company, (4) it does weird stuff, etc. It is not a “fledgling company” in the sense that it has raised $12.8 billion and has thousands of employees. If public markets sour on the current crop of startups, that will propagate back to the private markets, but I suspect it will be felt most by the big private tech companies looking to raise billions of dollars at 11-digit valuations. That is the model that seems to be specifically going wrong.
One thing to think about is poor SoftBank Group Corp., which is out raising its second $100 billion Vision Fund even as the wheels are falling off the IPO market. The timing is awkward in a narrow sense because potential investors in Vision Fund II will be interested in the performance of Vision Fund I, and Vision Fund I was a late-stage investor in WeWork and Uber and has taken some big valuation hits recently. If you invested in Vision Fund I because you had total faith in Masayoshi Son’s abilities as a stock-picker, you might have changed your mind by Vision Fund II.
But the timing is awkward in a broader sense because the recent IPO sputtering calls into question not just Son’s ability to pick winners but also the whole thesis of having a hundred-billion-dollar venture fund in the first place. Traditionally venture capital involved putting modest amounts of money into relatively small companies so they could get themselves in shape to go public. Vision Fund venture capital involves putting billions of dollars into multibillion-dollar companies so they can grow rapidly without making any money. Uber and WeWork are the highest-profile examples of that strategy, and the fact that they were IPO duds might mean less that they were bad at executing it and more that the public market doesn’t believe it. And if that’s true, it’s a bad time to double down on the strategy.
If a public company misclassifies a lifesaving treatment as a generic drug rather than a branded drug, charging patients very high prices while paying relatively low rebates to the government for purchases through Medicaid, who is the victim there? The obvious answer is “patients,” the specifically correct answer is “Medicaid,” but as  readers of Money Stuff  know, the universally correct answer is “the shareholders”:
Naively you might think that overcharging for drugs is a way to transfer money from patients to shareholders, and that shareholders benefit in possibly socially harmful ways when drug companies gouge patients, but the galaxy brain of U.S. securities regulation says that you are wrong and that the shareholders are in fact the victims here.
“Do Non-GAAP Expense Exclusions Mislead Investors?,” is the headline of this blog post by Thomas Lopez, Christopher McCoy, Gary Taylor and Michael Young; their related paper is titled “Are Investors Misled by Non-GAAP Expense Exclusions Used to Beat Analysts’ Earnings Forecasts?” The answer is yes:
I find this extremely counterintuitive and frankly annoying, but there you go. There are two theories of why, alongside their earnings under generally accepted accounting principles, companies would also report non-GAAP earnings measures. One theory is that GAAP is its own odd set of conventions that does not always reflect economic reality or provide the clearest possible insight into the company’s business, and that companies report adjusted non-GAAP numbers to help investors and analysts get a fuller understanding of their results.
The other theory is that investors are extremely dimwitted and distractible, and if you say “we lost $2 per share but let’s just pretend we made $3 per share instead,” they will happily go along with it. It seems to me that this theory demands a high degree of stupidity of investors: Companies have to give the investors the GAAP numbers, and explain the differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP ones in detail, so the only way you could be fooled by the non-GAAP numbers is if you (1) don’t actually read the earnings release and (2) also don’t read the ten thousand articles a year about how companies are fooling investors with non-GAAP numbers. I tend to be a believer in the ability of markets, as emergent systems for aggregating and responding to information, to at least read a press release, so I do not find this theory appealing at all. Nonetheless, apparently true!
Last week Patrick Byrne, the former CEO of Overstock.com Inc., who recently  resigned as CEO because Warren Buffett had advised him to come clean about his affair with and betrayal of a Russian spy, did some even weirder stuff. We  talked about it at great length last week and I do not have the space or energy to get into it again. The short version is that he secretly dumped all of his Overstock stock in the middle a controversy about whether Overstock would get in trouble for engineering a short squeeze by paying a dividend on the blockchain. I apologize that you had to read that sentence but keep in mind that I had to type it. 
Anyway this week on his blog, which of course is called DeepCapture.com, Byrne justified his actions in detail. I am not personally able to read the post all the way through, but I have dipped into it at random and found it largely enjoyable, and figured I might pass it on to you. If you like this sort of stuff— 
—then there is a lot of that sort of stuff. For what it is worth I agree with him that there is no insider-trading problem with any of this, as long as I do not have to answer any follow-up questions or otherwise think any more about the issue.
Also this week, Overstock filed a shelf registration statement for its blockchain stock, which is apparently designed to allow the dividend of that stock to be freely tradable immediately. (See our previous discussion  here.) As I have mentioned before, neither I nor any securities lawyer I talk to understands why Overstock would need to do this to make the dividend freely tradable, but here they are, doing it.

The software is a growing part of the Post’s business -- albeit less visible than its scoops about the Trump administration.
Now, Arc is expanding into a new market, striking a deal with its first nonmedia customer: BP Plc. The energy giant’s communications team will use Arc’s software to publish articles and videos to its 70,000 employees across 250 internal websites, newsletters and a future mobile app.
“We realized that many large companies are essentially publishers,” said Fred Ryan, the Post’s publisher.
Post executives say Arc’s suite of tools makes it easier for companies to post on different platforms -- including apps, mobile websites, newsletters and social media -- and make money through advertising or subscriptions.
The Post created the Arc licensing business in 2014 by giving what had been its newsroom’s proprietary software away free to college newspapers. Its customer base has expanded to media companies that run more than 600 websites globally, including the Boston Globe, Tribune Publishing Co. and Raycom Media Inc. Now, the Post sees a chance to license its software to companies beyond the media industry.
Arc has about 250 employees, with many engineers working out of an office in Chicago. Its sales tripled from 2016 to 2017 and then more than doubled the following year. Within the next three years, Arc expects to generate $100 million in annual revenue, said Shailesh Prakash, chief information officer and vice president of product at the Washington Post. Arc isn’t yet profitable, Prakash said, but he sees it becoming the Post’s third major revenue stream.
“I’m very confident this will be comparable to our advertising and subscriptions business,” Prakash said.
Arc is one of a few companies that sell publishing technology. One of them is WordPress.com, whose parent company, Automattic Inc., raised $300 million this month from the tech giant Salesforce.com Inc. Vox Media Inc., owner of the Verge, Eater and Recode websites, licenses its publishing platform, called Chorus, to media outlets such as the Ringer, led by Bill Simmons.
Arc has an advantage, Prakash said, because it is tied to Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud computing operation, Amazon Web Services, and is built by the Washington Post.
“We have cranky journalists who demand and use this every day, so there’s nowhere for me to hide,” Prakash said.
Prakash said he often talks to Bezos about strategic decisions with Arc and has showed him demos of the software. Bezos recently suggested that Arc switch to a serverless architecture that has made the product faster and cheaper to run, he said.
Having Bezos as an owner has also helped the Post recruit and retain engineers, Ryan said.
“You could be a top engineer at any one of the major tech platforms, but it would probably be unlikely that you’d be engaging with the CEO of that company on any regular basis,” Ryan said. “But here, you have these engineers who roughly every two weeks are engaging with Jeff Bezos, one of the leading technologists of our time.”

Whatever the outcome of the House’s inquiry, the electoral effects will probably be small – and possibly nonexistent.
And so it begins.

With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  announcing a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, it’s worth considering the electoral politics involved. It’s early to speculate on such things, of course. There’s been no polling on the  whistle-blower complaint that prompted this announcement. Nor do we know whether the House will wind up voting for impeachment or what the Senate will do. But we can think about how public opinion and elections normally work, and how the uncertainties of impeachment may factor in. 
So far, President Donald Trump is unpopular – and, polls say, so is impeachment. I expect the latter to change. The more that highly visible Democrats are united in favor of impeachment, the more that Democratic voters and independents who dislike Trump will likely shift toward their position. I wouldn’t be surprised if that shift happens rapidly, at least if the news media gives saturation coverage to the story and voters start to learn more about it. 
I think it’s a lot less likely that Trump’s popularity will change. Yes, President Richard Nixon’s approval ratings dropped dramatically over the course of the Watergate scandal. But there are a lot of differences, starting with the fact that Trump has a lot less ground to lose. It’s possible that new facts could push mild Trump supporters into being mild Trump opponents (and so on for other levels of support), but I wouldn’t count on a lot of that. What really could hurt Trump would be if numerous high-profile Republicans turned against him. That’s unlikely, because those Republicans know that the less popular Trump is, the worse off all party candidates will be in the next election. But if Trump’s approval ratings are going be harmed, that’s how it’ll happen.
Could impeachment actually make Trump more popular? That, too, is possible but unlikely. President Bill Clinton was probably helped by a partisan impeachment that most neutral opinion leaders, and even some Republicans, thought was a bad idea. I don’t think that’s where elite opinion will be this time. If, however, this winds up uniting congressional Republicans, and some Democrats go along in opposition, it could conceivably help Trump. But I wouldn’t count on it. One reason: He’s going to keep doing things that people who have turned against him don’t like. 
Assuming Trump survives and becomes the Republican nominee next year, the effects of impeachment per se on the presidential election will probably be small and possibly nonexistent. We don’t know how long any impeachment and trial would last, but voters tend to have shockingly short memories. 
What about congressional elections? In 1974, Republicans lost in a landslide soon after Nixon resigned. That was, in large part, a story about expectations: Since both parties expected disaster for Republicans, strong Democrats ran while strong Republicans didn’t, and Democrats maximized their resources while Republicans failed to. Voters weren’t trying to punish Nixon (or new President Gerald Ford), but the effects of a highly unpopular presidency mattered. In 1998, Democrats did very well for a midterm with a second-term president, actually gaining seats in the House. Congressional elections expert Gary Jacobson found that Republicans actually were helped in candidate recruitment by the Clinton scandal, but that impeachment – underway at election time – was unpopular with voters, which hurt them. The net effect, Jacobson concluded, was probably a wash.
Right now, we’re in the period where candidates, including incumbents, are deciding whether to run in 2020, so expectations about how impeachment will play out could certainly have some influence. But I’d expect few voters to choose candidates based mainly on impeachment, which will presumably be long over by then. In fact, I suspect Democratic hopes of using impeachment against marginal Senate Republicans such as Susan Collins in Maine and Cory Gardner in Colorado are likely to fizzle, as are Republican hopes of using impeachment against House Democrats who won in Republican-friendly districts in 2018. Those candidates may lose. But my guess is that impeachment votes won’t be a major factor, and might be no factor at all.

Folks, I think the president of the United States is going to be impeached.
The signals are clear. First, seven new members of the House, all with national-security backgrounds, published an op-ed Monday demanding that the administration hand over a whistle-blower complaint that reportedly  alleges misconduct by President Donald Trump – and saying that impeachment would be the proper response if the reports about the complaint are true. Then two allies of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said much the same. 
Impeachment still isn’t certain. The immediate flash point is a Thursday deadline the House has set for the whistle-blower complaint to be delivered. If the administration complies, it’s possible that the added details in the complaint could defuse the situation somewhat (although what Trump has already admitted to should be sufficient for an impeachment). And so far, only the Republican-turned-independent Justin Amash seems likely to join the House Democrats, while conviction would require a lot more Republican defections than seem likely at the moment. 
Time for a Watergate story. Very early on, when the original cover-up was still intact and President Richard Nixon was cruising to a landslide re-election, House Majority Leader Tip O’Neill, as Fred Emery tells the story, “reckoned that so many bad things had been done by the Nixon men that they simply could not be kept secret indefinitely. Privately, he urged his surprised colleagues in the House leadership to ‘get ready for impeachment.’”
But O’Neill was patient. The House didn’t move after the cover-up collapsed in spring 1973, or after dramatic Senate hearings that summer revealed that Nixon was personally involved. Only after the Saturday Night Massacre in October, when Nixon ordered Justice Department officials to fire the special prosecutor overseeing the probe, did they start moving toward impeachment. And then for months, the judiciary committee slowly gathered evidence to make its case. This strategy eventually worked, as the story gradually came out and moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats began defecting from Nixon – followed by the rest of the Republican Party in August 1974. 
Has Pelosi been emulating O’Neill? She’s been taking plenty of heat from pro-impeachment Democrats. She’s certainly been unwilling to get ahead of her caucus. Perhaps that’s because she thinks impeachment could be avoided. Or perhaps she’s been betting that Trump’s past and current lawlessness would keep supplying new evidence pushing ambivalent Democrats toward action – and that a measured, patient process would be far stronger than a rushed one. 
After all, whatever the merits of a party-line impeachment, an effort that could barely get the necessary 218 votes out of the 239 Democrats (plus Amash) would be much weaker, and we still don’t know whether House Democrats would vote unanimously. In fact, there’s plenty we don’t know. The Washington Post reports that the House leadership is considering using a select committee to pursue impeachment. (Odd, isn’t it, that the famously anti-impeachment leadership seems to have advanced plans for how to do the deed?) Nor is it clear what the scope of such proceedings would be: Just the whistle-blower story? That plus the obstruction of justice identified by special counsel Robert Mueller? Plus emoluments and conflicts of interest? Plus other abuses of power? The one thing this situation isn’t lacking is legitimate material to investigate.
Even so, Democrats haven’t yet committed to go ahead with impeachment. Most of their public statements have only called for an impeachment inquiry, which of course has been  taking place with or without formal authorization for months now. But it does seem likely that the more advanced their process gets, the harder it will be to apply the brakes. Especially given that Trump is extremely unlikely to (say) cooperate with normal oversight procedures, and thus will make the substantive case for impeachment stronger. There may also be a lot of shoes left to drop. 
No one knows yet whether Republicans will take all this seriously, let alone vote to impeach or remove the president. And the Senate majority can set the rules for an impeachment trial any way they like, so long as they have the votes; a trial about the whistle-blower accusations could well wind up mired in unsubstantiated rumors and accusations about former Vice President Joe Biden. But yes, add all of it up, and it certainly seems likely we’re headed for impeachment.

And subscribe to Terms of Trade, our daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
Vietnam’s campaign to tamp down the Trump administration’s trade gap ire has come to a coastal commune better known for growing dragon fruit along one-lane potholed roads.
The community could soon be home to a $5 billion liquefied natural gas project that would include an import terminal and gas-fired power plant and eventually import billions of dollars of U.S. fuel into the country. It’s being fast-tracked with the blessing of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc as part of a push to buy American products in Vietnam, where the Communist government has embarked on a crash course in modern U.S. politics.
LNG project rendering.
“I’ve never seen the Vietnamese government move so quickly,” said John Rockhold, an engineer with 28 years experience shepherding infrastructure projects in Vietnam. He is country director of Energy Capital Vietnam, which is leading a consortium of companies backing the development on salt beds in southern Binh Thuan province. “I think they see LNG as a way of lowering the trade deficit the U.S. has with Vietnam. There is a lot of pressure from the White House right now.”
Indeed, the nation’s leaders are doing all they can to avoid China’s fate after President Donald Trump in June described Vietnam as “almost the single worst abuser of everybody” when asked if he wanted to impose tariffs on the nation. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer “has a scoreboard: if you have a trade surplus with the U.S. of over $10 billion, you are in the middle of his dart board,” said Ernest Bower, president of Fairfax, Virginia-based Bower Group Asia, which advises businesses on operating in Southeast Asia.
Donald Trump, right, and Nguyen Xuan Phuc in Hanoi on Feb. 27.
Under pressure from the U.S., Vietnam is also cracking down on the fake labeling of Chinese goods being routed through the Southeast Asian country to bypass Trump’s tariffs.
Vietnam has become perhaps Asia’s biggest beneficiary of the U.S.-China trade war as companies including Nintendo Co. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google shift production to the country. So Vietnamese officials, from the politburo to local governments, are looking for ways to trim the nation’s trade surplus with the U.S., which hit $40 billion in 2018. That gap totaled $30 billion in the first seven months of this year, 39% higher than in the same period last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
“If we buy more from the U.S., it will surely help boost our relationship with them,” said Mai Anh Tung, a government official in Binh Thuan province, where the LNG project involving companies such as General Electric Co., KBR Inc. and Korea Gas is planned.
Vietnam’s Communist Party Secretary and President Nguyen Phu Trong is expected to visit the White House next month with a deal list for made-in-America products. Think natural gas from Texas, coal from Pennsylvania, pork from Iowa, and even aircraft engines -- a shopping cart that could total billions of dollars. It’s no coincidence that many of these products come from regions that are important to Trump’s re-election hopes in 2020.
Nguyen Phu Trong
“They have hired trade advisers,” Bower said. “They’ve learned you have to have a game in Washington.”
This isn’t the first time Trump has pressured Vietnam on trade. The U.S. president prodded Vietnamese leaders to buy U.S. military equipment during his 2017 visit to the country, reminding his hosts that he would face re-election. Vietnam, which until 2016 was barred from buying U.S. military weapons systems, has received training from the U.S. on navigating America’s procurement process, said Tuong Vu, a professor of political science at the University of Oregon.
Vietnam’s one-party government can influence decisions of private companies, state-owned enterprises and local authorities, such as those overseeing the LNG project in Binh Thuan province, 212 kilometers (132 miles) northeast of Ho Chi Minh City. The project will buy U.S. LNG, though discussions with suppliers haven’t begun yet, Rockhold said.
“If private companies support the policies of the government, the government can support the private companies in other ways,” said Le Dang Doanh, a Hanoi-based economist and former government adviser. “All the tycoons in Vietnam are well-connected with the leadership of the government.”
In fact, Phuc hasn’t been shy about his U.S. shopping spree. He made a beeline for the U.S. president at the Group of 20 summit in Japan for an impromptu huddle, promising to buy “large volumes” of LNG. The country’s total LNG demand is estimated to reach 4 million tons a year by 2030, according to BloombergNEF analysts. Importing all of that fuel from the U.S. -- valued at about $1.5 billion a year -- would equal 3.7% of the country’s 2018 trade surplus with America.
This month Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. announced a non-binding term sheet that could lead to the first deal to supply U.S. gas to Vietnam for a Mekong Delta power plant. The agreement, which could result in $30 billion of exports from the U.S. over the 25-year project, would “help balance Vietnam’s trade surplus with the U.S.,” Singapore-based Delta Offshore Energy PTE LTD, which plans to build the plant, said in a press release.

Phuc in a January interview promised that his country would buy more Boeing Co. aircraft. A month later, during Trump’s visit to Hanoi to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, Vietnam’s Bamboo Airways and VietJet Aviation JSC signed agreements to purchase 110 Boeing jets. State-owned Vietnam Airlines JSC says it is considering an order for 50-100 737 Max.
“Doing business with U.S. partners is safe and it can help develop the relationship between Vietnam and the U.S.,” Bamboo Airways Chairman Trinh Van Quyet said.
In August, state-run Vietnam National Coal-Mineral Industries announced it was negotiating to buy U.S. coal for the first time from Xcoal Energy & Resources LLC, which is based in Pennsylvania, a state expected to play a pivotal role in the 2020 election and which Trump won in 2016.
Meanwhile, Nestor Scherbey, a licensed U.S. customs broker and consultant based in Ho Chi Minh City, is working with U.S. meat suppliers to help fill an estimated 500,000-ton pork shortage -- valued at $1.29 billion -- expected between now and the Tet Lunar New Year amid a swine fever epidemic that has reduced Vietnam’s hog population.
Packs of imported frozen American meat at a grocery store in Vietnam.
“You’ll start seeing things like packaged ham shipped from Texas in Vietnam supermarkets,” he said.
Vietnamese consumers already favor American products. The nation imported more than $3.1 billion in U.S. electronics, such as iPhones and Dell Technologies Inc. laptops, in the first eight months of the year, a 52% increase from last year, according to government statistics. U.S. vegetable and fruit imports have soared 72% as Washington Gala apples and Thompson seedless grapes are showing up in supermarket checkout lines.
Still, with an average annual per capita income of 58.5 million dong ($2,522), boosting other pricey imports isn’t a given. Alaskan lobster, which sells for the equivalent of $56 per kilogram in Ho Chi Minh City, and Ford Motor Co.’s Explorer sport utility vehicle, with a price tag of about $97,700 in Vietnam, are out of reach for most Vietnamese consumers.
A customer looks at a Explorer SUV on display at the Ford dealership in Ho Chi Minh City.
Vietnam’s efforts to boost imports from the U.S. faces another complication: Trump’s decision to exit the 12-nation transpacific trade deal. The pact will eventually slash 90% of tariffs from nations such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Canada -- putting U.S. exports at a disadvantage, said Fred Burke, managing partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie.
“Many of the most significant tariff reductions will begin taking effect in the run-up to the presidential election in the U.S.,” he said.

Sign up here. 
Blaming a weakening global economy, FedEx Corp. sliced its profit outlook in the latest sign that trade tensions are dragging down U.S. corporate titans. The shares tumbled.
The forecast signaled deepening trouble for the courier as the U.S. and China battle over tariffs -- which has also ensnared manufacturing giants such as Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Co. FedEx, which had announced an employee-buyout program in January, said it would pare its cargo-jet fleet to contend with the diminished expectations.
“The global economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to cut capacity,” Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said in a conference call to discuss earnings late Tuesday. The slowdown is being “driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty.”
Analysts, however, said some of FedEx’s problems were of its own making.
President Donald Trump’s trade maneuvers are tormenting Smith, a free-trade advocate and longtime Republican donor who has sounded the alarm quarter after quarter that tariffs would hurt economic growth. Commercial tensions are complicating FedEx’s costly integration of a European acquisition and putting the company under the microscope of the Chinese government. FedEx is also girding for a revenue drag after severing most ties with Amazon.com Inc.

The shares tumbled 10% to $155.29 before the start of regular trading in New York on Wednesday. The drop wiped out FedEx’s year-to-date gain and spurred declines at rivals such as United Parcel Service Inc. and Germany’s Deutsche Post AG. FedEx was already trailing the returns this year of UPS and a Standard & Poor index of U.S. industrial companies.
FedEx failed to acknowledge “its own execution failures,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra.
“In reality, FedEx’s release is largely the result of many management missteps over the years, including overspending on aircraft despite weaker returns in Express over the long-term, and acquisition debacles,” he said in note to investors.
The U.S.-China trade war has weighed on manufacturers, disrupting a key market for FedEx. A surge in industrial jobs seen in the first two years of Trump’s presidency has reversed in parts of the country, and there’s evidence that some corners of the U.S. economy are sliding toward recession. Companies have slowed business investment and capital expenditures as uncertainty over trade policies has clouded the outlook for future growth.
For FedEx, the weaker outlook underscored the hurdles as the company introduces costly changes to its ground network to handle surging e-commerce deliveries while contending with rising competition from Amazon.
FedEx stuck with its plan to invest $5.9 billion for fiscal year 2020, which ends in May, and will probably match that in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said on the call. The company needs to spend on new aircraft and to modernize sorting hubs, Graf said.
But to reduce capacity at the Express air-shipping network, FedEx will retire as many as 20 older planes and park additional aircraft as it adjusts to the weaker economic outlook. The company already announced a $575 million employee-buyout program in January.
“FedEx is implementing additional cost-reduction initiatives to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty, including post-peak reductions to the global FedEx Express air network to better match capacity with demand,” Graf said.
The Memphis, Tennessee-based company failed to renew contracts with Amazon for U.S. ground deliveries and air shipments as the e-commerce retailer builds out its own transportation network.
The move will dent FedEx’s sales since Amazon had accounted for about 1.3% of annual revenue. But FedEx is betting that the decision will boost profit margins because the business fetched below-average prices.
Earnings are already under pressure from the weaker global economy.
The courier’s best-case scenario for adjusted earnings in the fiscal year ending in May was only $13 a share -- a dollar short of the lowest of 25 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The forecast implied at least a 16% drop from the previous year’s level. FedEx had predicted in June a decline of a “mid-single-digit percentage point.”
In the fiscal first quarter, adjusted earnings dropped to $3.05 a share, FedEx said in a statement. That trailed the $3.15 average of analyst estimates complied by Bloomberg. Sales were little changed at $17 billion. Operating income fell 8.8% to $977 million in the quarter. Operating margins narrowed to 5.7% from 6.3%.
An economic slowdown in Europe is hampering FedEx’s effort to turn around operations at TNT Express, a Dutch company acquired in 2016 for $4.8 billion. Integration spending will be about $350 million over the 12-months ending in May 2020, FedEx said in June, pushing the expected total to about $1.7 billion by May 2021.
For now, the company is running both the TNT and FedEx networks in Europe, which drives up costs, said Seaport’s Sterling.
In China, FedEx has been under scrutiny in recent months after Huawei Technologies Co. said documents that it asked to be shipped from Japan to China were instead diverted to the U.S. without authorization.
In another incident, FedEx said it mistakenly rejected a package containing a Huawei phone being sent to the U.S. from the U.K., a claim China rebuffed.
Earlier this month, China said it was investigating FedEx on suspicion of illegally handling a package to Hong Kong containing knives that are controlled by law, according to a report by state-run Xinhua News Agency.

Washington (AP) -- President Donald Trump planned to have dinner Saturday with the parents of an American college student who died in 2017 shortly after being freed from captivity in North Korea.
An administration official said Trump was to host the parents of Otto Warmbier, who was convicted of trying to steal a propaganda poster while in the North Korea capital and spent 17 months in prison. He died at age 22 just days after being returned to the United States in a vegetative state.
Trump's ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, was expected to join the dinner. Officials say he is among the 15 candidates Trump is considering to replace ousted national security adviser John Bolton.
By mid-evening Saturday the White House had not confirmed that the dinner had taken place.
Warmbier's parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier of suburban Cincinnati, say their son was tortured in prison. They were angered by Trump's comments last spring that he took North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""at his word"" that he was unaware of any mistreatment of their son.
Trump later tweeted, ""Of course I hold North Korea responsible for Otto's mistreatment and death."" The tweet made no mention of Kim, with whom Trump is pursuing nuclear talks.
Doctors in Cincinnati said Warmbier had suffered severe brain damage, although they weren't sure what led to it. North Korea denied mistreating him, saying he fell into a coma that resulted from botulism and a sleeping pill.
A law firm representing the Warmbier family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump is also set to have dinner Saturday with Richard Grenell, currently the U.S. ambassador to Germany, according to one of the people. But Grenell, whose name has been floated as a possible replacement for Bolton, is being interviewed for another job, the person said. 
Fred and Cindy Warmbier -- whose son Otto, a University of Virginia student, was held in North Korea for more than 17 months and died shortly after he was sent home in a coma in 2017 -- will also be guests at that dinner. CNN reported earlier that they would attend.
The White House declined to comment late Friday about the meetings. The State Department also declined to comment.

Pompeo backs the candidacies of O’Brien, Hook and Ricky Waddell, a former national security official, according to one person familiar with his thinking. The Washington Post first reported Pompeo’s support of the trio.
Trump said Thursday, while speaking to reporters at the White House, that he had 15 candidates for the post, and that he’s not surprised in the interest for what he considers an easy job. “You know why it’s easy? Because I make all of the decisions, you don’t have to work,” Trump said.

Sign up here. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues are loath to follow Europe and Japan into negative interest rate territory -- no matter what President Donald Trump might want or how bad the U.S. economy might get.
Not only could such a move be deemed illegal, it’s also unclear how much of an economic gain it would yield given the likely disruption it could cause to banks and money market funds.
“I don’t see negative interest rates being a very useful part of our arsenal,” Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in a televised interview with Yahoo Finance in June.
Trump on Wednesday urged the Fed to “get our interest rates down to zero, or less,” arguing in a tweet that the move would allow the U.S. government to bring the cost of servicing its debt “way down.” The tweet came a day before the European Central Bank is expected to cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to minus 0.5%.
With unemployment near a half-century low and the economy still expanding, the Fed is a long way from slashing rates to zero or below. It is though widely expected to cut rates by a quarter percentage point next week to a range of 1.75% to 2% in response to muted inflation and slowing global growth.
The more pertinent question is whether the Fed would push rates into negative territory if the U.S. economy tumbled into a recession. Based on policy makers’ public and private comments, the answer is probably not.
Instead, they’d look to other tools -- such as large-scale bond purchases and forward interest-rate guidance -- to try to provide the economy with a needed boost.
Negative rates are “way down the list of things that they would do,” said Johns Hopkins University professor and former Fed economist Jonathan Wright.
The gains are limited, while the political fallout -- Trump to the contrary -- could be large. When the Fed reduced rates to a range of zero to 0.25% in 2008 and kept them there for seven years, it was frequently criticized by lawmakers for short-changing savers.
The Fed studied the possibility of lowering rates below zero in the 2008-2009 financial crisis and its aftermath and found it “wanting,” Vice Chairman Richard Clarida told a Bank of France event in March.
Indeed, in an August 2010 memo, Fed staff members questioned whether the central bank had the legal authority to set negative interest rates in the U.S.
The Fed in 2008 gained authority from Congress to pay commercial banks interest on reserve balances deposited at the central bank. It’s not clear whether that authority extends to establishing negative rates on those reserves.

In the 2010 memo, Fed staffers also raised concerns about the impact that sub-zero rates would have on banks and money market funds.
That’s still a reason for caution in some policy makers’ minds.
“I’m a skeptic about whether that’s a viable option,” Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said in February when asked about the possibility of lowering rates below zero.
Five central banks with negative interest rates


The “big worry” would be “the impact on the financial system and the ability of financial intermediaries to actually be healthy and function,” he said at a Dallas event.
Some economists argue that there’s a limit on how far rates can be pushed down before they perversely start to hurt the economy by prompting profit-pinched banks to curb their lending.
“Negative rates definitely would play havoc with bank profitability,” said Fred Cannon, research director at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Even so, U.S. banks may suffer less than their counterparts in Europe and Japan, he said. That’s because they hold fewer lower-yielding corporate and mortgage loans on their balance sheets.
Money-market funds would also be squeezed by negative rates, though reforms unveiled by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2014 mean that some are less vulnerable than they were before.
If rates fall below zero, the funds’ first line of defense against investors yanking out their money would be to reduce the fees that the managers charge.
“If rates don’t go too far negative, the playbook says suck it up and survive on lower fees,” said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data, which tracks money-market funds. “If you go too negative like you see in Europe, then you need another plan.”
The Fed is in the midst of a wide-ranging strategic study of ways it can tackle what Powell has called the “key question” facing it: How can it best manage the ups and downs of the economy in a world of permanently lower interest rates.
But negative rates don’t seem to be high on the agenda. A listing of Fed research relevant to the review on the central bank’s website doesn’t include a section on negative rates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli noted.
What’s more, two of the academic papers presented at a Chicago Fed conference on the review -- including one co-authored by Wright -- cast doubt on how effective they can be.
“Negative rates provide limited stimulus at best,” Notre Dame University professor Jing Cynthia Wu, co-author of the other paper given at the June meeting, said in an email. “At the same time, they could hurt bank profitability.”

Also an embarrassing bond-trading error and possible search manipulation.
One thing you could do is, you rent some buildings, and then you make them fancier, and then you convince people to rent offices in the buildings from you for more than you pay for them. If this is a good business and you do it well, more money will come in than goes out, and you can use some of the extra money to rent some more buildings and make them fancier, so the business will grow. If it is not a good business, on the other hand, or if you are not good at it, then more money will go out than comes in, and you should stop doing it, because why are you doing a business that loses money.
This lemonade-stand sort of financial analysis is oversimplified, of course. Basically every business is going to have more money going out than coming in at first—you have to spend money to rent the buildings and make them fancier before you ever get a tenant—and so you’ll need access to some capital at the beginning. And if this is a good business, you will probably want it to grow rapidly early on so that you can have a head start on being the dominant player in the industry and making a lot of money from it. So you might want to raise a lot of capital early on, so you can rent lots of buildings all at once rather than waiting to make enough money from the first building to rent a second one.
You could imagine a range of possible growth paths. At one (quite common) extreme, you start as small as possible and bootstrap growth using only the money you make from doing the business; you are always profitable but you grow very slowly. At the other (purely imaginary) extreme, you start by imagining the total size of the business in the distant future when it has achieved total market dominance around the globe, and you raise enough money on the first day to get there immediately. If you can do that then you will grow very fast and take maximum advantage of the opportunity for your business, but on the other hand, if you’ve never executed the business profitably why would people give you all that money? I mean: They probably will! Modern tech funding markets can get you arbitrarily close to this extreme. Still the “why” seems like a reasonable question.
The We Co., the parent company of WeWork, has raised about $12.8 billion from private investors in its nine years of operations. Naively you might think that that much money could pay for renting and sprucing up a lot of buildings, and that WeWork could then find tenants for those buildings and make a lot of money. If your goal was to rapidly scale your building-renting business, $12.8 billion would probably get you a lot of the way there. But not all the way? In fact, WeWork had a net loss of about $1.9 billion in 2018, and of about $904 million in the first half of 2019. “As we continue to pursue rapid growth,” WeWork explains, “we continue to operate in a state where the majority of our locations are non-mature and have not reached stable operating performance.” It could be profitable, but it would rather grow:
And so it is seeking to raise $9 or $10 billion from an initial public offering—$3 or $4 billion in the IPO itself, and another $6 billion in bank loans contingent on the IPO—to keep throwing into that furnace. That does not seem to be going especially well! But another way to look at it is, no, actually, this is great; it presents WeWork with a golden opportunity to manage its profitability profile.
Anyway, anyway, anyway:
And  here is Bloomberg News on SoftBank’s efforts to postpone the IPO. On the other hand, “the WeWork initial public offering is full speed ahead, sources familiar with the matter tell CNBC’s David Faber.”
One possibility here is that SoftBank Group Corp., its affiliated Vision Fund and WeWork’s other private investors own stakes in a high-quality business with fundamentally sound unit economics. Given the attractive market opportunity, they would like it to raise another giant slug of money to continue its rapid growth. But public investors have started to doubt the quality of its business, and are not willing to fund its growth at a price reflecting its strong fundamentals. So WeWork can step back, remain private, slow its growth, flip to profitability and just harvest the rich rewards of renting out office space for more than its costs. Then, after it demonstrates how profitable the underlying business is, maybe public investors will start clamoring to get in to fund more growth. Or maybe they won’t, and SoftBank et al. will just own stakes in a lucrative private business that sends them fat dividends every year from all the money it is making.
There are other possibilities! The investors who doubt WeWork’s underlying business model have read that paragraph I quoted above, the one about how WeWork can turn on the profits at any time. They have doubts anyway.
One nice thing about postponing the IPO is that you get to find out. Missing out on the $10 billion of public money would slow down WeWork’s growth plans, but if WeWork is right then there is just a dial that it can turn between “Growth” and “Profit,” and dialing down the growth automatically dials up the profits. If you are confident that you possess this dial and that it works this way, then delaying the IPO is a no-brainer: Sure you delay your positive-expected-value growth, but you get to keep ownership of a good lucrative business rather than selling it too cheap. On the other hand, if the dial turns out not to work, then you’ll end up wishing you’d sold it cheap.
Elsewhere, Aswath Damodaran makes an effort to value WeWork, and comes up with about $13.75 billion, which is probably not a number that SoftBank wants to hear. And WeWork “plans to rely on junk bonds for funding for the foreseeable future,” and “could also explore whole-business securitizations”; I look forward to reading that prospectus. And: “WeWork Bonds  Drop Below Par for First Time Since IPO Filing.” And at Stratechery, Ben Thompson considers the bigger picture:
And here is Fred Wilson on “Why Positive Cashflow Matters”: “If you have positive cashflow, you can control the timing and terms of your capital raises. … Positive cash flow puts you on control versus the capital markets.”
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, AHHHHHHHH:
AHHHHHHHH! What happened here is that the estate of Lehman Brothers was selling off some random scraps of bonds, including 22,955 Peruvian government GDNs. Exotix wanted to buy some different bonds and, to get that trade done, also agreed to take the GDNs off of Lehman’s hands. Each GDN had a face value of 1,000 Peruvian soles (about $354 at the time), but it seems that neither the Lehman trader charged with unloading them, nor the Exotix trader who agreed to buy them, knew that. All they knew was that the bonds traded for 91.5 cents on the dollar, and that on their screens they saw something like “22,955 Peru GDNs.”
There is a perennial, extremely low-grade yet haunting problem in finance, which is this: If you look at a screen and see “22,955 Peru GDNs,” does that mean (1) 22,955 soles worth of GDNs or (2) 22,955 GDNs each with a face value of 1,000 soles? (This is not a Peruvian problem, and you might similarly wonder if “22,955 Apple bonds” means $22,955 worth of bonds or 22,955 bonds worth $23 million.) There is no absolutely reliable universal convention, though context generally clears it up. For one thing, Peruvian GDNs seem to come in 1,000-sol units (just as many dollar bonds come in $1,000 units), so you couldn’t actually buy 22,955 soles’ worth of GDNs if you tried. So there would have been no confusion if either trader knew anything about Peruvian GDNs, which they apparently didn’t.
For another thing … people usually just don’t have three orders of magnitude of uncertainty about the size of their trades? Like if someone you regularly trade with called you up and offered you “ten thousand bonds,” or “ten million bonds,” you’d be the sort of person who regularly traded $10,000, or $10 million, or $10 billion worth of bonds with them, so you’d just instinctively understand if “bonds” there meant “dollars’ worth of bonds” or “thousand-dollar increments of bonds.” But this trade was a weird scrap that neither side was paying attention to; they had no practice dealing in Peruvian GDNs, and the context was lost.
And so somehow both traders just assumed without specifying that 22,955 GDNs meant 22,955 soles’ worth of GDNs rather than 23 million worth. And so Lehman agreed to sell them, and Exotix agreed to buy them, at a price of 91.5 cents on the dollar, or about $7,438 for the lot (if you thought the lot was 22,955 soles’ worth, as they did). And Exotix wired Lehman the $7,438 (plus a little bit of accrued interest), and Lehman sent Exotix $7.4 million worth of bonds. And then Exotix figured it out and, “after some internal hesitation,” decided they’d keep them.
I paused at this point to spend some happy minutes in contemplation of that internal hesitation, and almost wrote you a little imagined dialogue to capture Exotix’s reaction to finding an extra $7.4 million of free bonds and its debate about whether to give them back. But then I read further in the court judgment, and that hesitation is actually described in some detail and better than I could have imagined:
Lehman eventually figured this out, though only after Exotix had sold the bonds. It sued in an English court, and yesterday Lehman won; I have been quoting from the judgment. It’s … fine? Either way would be fine, really. An earlier version of this newsletter said that Exotix won, because I misread it, sorry, though I suppose there is something appropriately meta about that. 
A basic way to do market manipulation is, you own some stock and you want to sell it, so you do some trades with your friends at high prices, so bystanders thinks the stock trades at a high price, and then you sell the stock to someone else at a high price. This works (sometimes, imperfectly) because practically speaking the main input into most people’s valuation models is the price. If a stock trades at $10, people tend to think it’s worth $10, so you can probably sell it to them for $10. 
Another basic way to do securities fraud is, you own a company and you want to sell some stock, so you put out fake financial statements that say that your company made a lot of money last quarter and fake announcements that it will make even more money next quarter, and then you sell stock to people who believe you. This works (sometimes, imperfectly) because things like profits and growth are also important inputs into many people’s valuation models. If a company makes money, people tend to think its stock is valuable, that sort of thing.
This is all pretty basic stuff and you can only go so far with it. These things—manipulative trading, fake accounting—are pretty closely scrutinized by a lot of regulators. Even beyond that, though, markets just have some (imperfect) self-correcting mechanisms to avoid getting taken in by this sort of thing. I can pump up the price of some thinly traded stock by trading it with my buddies, but I can’t do that very effectively with Apple Inc. stock, because a whole lot of other unrelated people trade it for unrelated reasons and I am just not going to move the price that much. I can put out fake accounts audited by a fly-by-night auditor for some weird penny stock, but if I’m doing accounting fraud at a big company I will have to get my accounts past a real auditor and a bunch of research analysts who closely follow the stock and who will ask hard questions if the Magic Beans Division suddenly starts producing huge profits. The most efficient things to manipulate are the things that everyone pays attention to—the stock price, the financial statements—but they’re also hard to manipulate precisely because everyone pays attention to them.
But we now live in a world in which algorithmic traders seek an edge by processing lots of data beyond just historical prices and accounting data. The algos are reading the tweets. They are considering sentiment. They are getting data from satellites and credit-card processors and location-tracking apps. There is a whole world of alternative data out there, and it feeds into algorithms that make trading decisions. What if you manipulated that?
Here’s a fun story from Billy Bambrough at Forbes:
This is neither legal nor investing advice, but if you run a hedge fund with a lot of exposure to retailers, you might consider going out and painting a bunch of car-shaped splotches in a bunch of parking lots to trick the satellites into thinking business is better than it is. Manipulating trading prices and accounting numbers is familiar territory and has familiar problems; manipulating alternative data is a whole new world of dubiously legal opportunity. I would really like to see a regulator bring a manipulation case against someone for Googling “BTC” a lot! It doesn’t exactly seem like the sort of thing that is illegal? But who knows.

123,FRED,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-14/trump-meets-a-contender-for-national-security-adviser-post,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-10/robert-frank-trailblazing-photographer-of-american-life-dies,"September 10, 2019, 9:19 AM EDT","Robert Frank, Trailblazing Photographer of American Life, Dies","Robert Frank, the Swiss-born photographer who captured the loneliness and heartache of life in his 1958 book “The Americans” and became a trailblazer for the Beat Generation, has died. He was 94.
He died on Monday in Inverness, Nova Scotia. His death was confirmed by Peter MacGill of Pace-MacGill Gallery in Manhattan, according to the New York Times.
Frank challenged predominant images of the day, viewing U.S. society through the lens of an outsider to expose the poverty, racism and alienation previously ignored in portrayals of the American dream. From passengers inside a trolley bus in New Orleans to Ford factory workers in Michigan and a lone rodeo cowboy in New York, Frank’s offbeat pictures struck a chord with a generation that redefined the nation’s cultural identity.
“He sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world,” Jack Kerouac, the author of the 1957 Beat classic “On the Road”, wrote in his introduction to Frank’s book. “To Robert Frank I now give this message: You got eyes.”
Initially panned by critics, the volume of 83 black-and-white photographs is now “widely celebrated as the most important photography book since World War II,” according to the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The U.S. edition of “The Americans” appeared in 1959.
From 1955 to 1956, Frank traveled across the U.S. on a Guggenheim Foundation grant to capture about 27,000 images of local life.
Accompanied by his wife, the former Mary Lockspeiser, and their two children for part of the trip, he drove 10,000 miles to take photos in states as diverse as California, New York, Wyoming, Nevada, Nebraska and Florida. He was thrown in jail in Arkansas, where police were suspicious of his accent and suspected him of being a communist.
Frank’s influence found fertile ground in the 1960s. While he focused more on making experimental films such as “Pull My Daisy” (1959), with Kerouac and poet Allen Ginsberg, his artistic vision inspired a new breed of photographers who were beginning to confront American society’s contradictions.
“I realized this man’s achievement could not be mined or imitated in any way because he had already done it, sewn it up and gone home,” U.S. photographer Ed Ruscha wrote in 2004 for an exhibition at the Tate Modern in London. “What I was left with was the vapors of his talent.”
Frank was born Nov. 9, 1924, in Zurich. His mother was Swiss and his father, who had a radio-importing business, was German. As a Swiss Jew, Frank was protected by Switzerland’s neutrality during World War II. He began taking photographs in the mid-1940s.
In 1947, he boarded a ship to New York and was offered a job as a fashion photographer at Harper’s Bazaar. During this time, he shuttled back and forth to Europe where he took photographs of Paris as well as England and Wales, a project that helped earn him the Guggenheim funding in 1955. He then embarked on the odyssey that became “The Americans.”
“I was absolutely free just to turn left or turn right without knowing what I would find,” he said.
Frank, who didn’t talk to his subjects, used 767 rolls of film, which he edited down to about 1,000 prints before selecting the ones to include in the book.
“I go into post offices, Woolworths, 10 cent shops, bus stations,” Frank said, according to the New Yorker. “I sleep in cheap hotels. Around 7 in the morning, I go to a nearby bar. I work all the time. I don’t speak much. I try not to be seen.”
Frank, who became a U.S. citizen in 1963, also made more than 20 films. “Pull My Daisy,” an experimental work that he co-directed, involved a bishop who pays a visit to a railroad worker and his bohemian friends. It was recognized as a major contribution to avant-garde cinema.
Some of Frank’s movies, such as “Conversations in Vermont” in 1969 and “Life Dances On” in 1980, were autobiographical, dealing with his children’s lives and the loss of his daughter, Andrea, who died in a plane crash in Guatemala in 1974. His son, Pablo, suffered from mental illness and died in 1994.
Frank divorced his first wife, the artist now known as Mary Frank, in 1969 and married sculptor June Leaf two years later. He lived in Nova Scotia, Canada, and in New York City.

Who’s in charge here?

I suppose someone has to come to the defense of Republicans in Congress after a series of confused complaints over the past week. As one headline put it: “21 British Conservatives put country over party. Why can’t 21 Republicans do the same?”
Comparing politicians with very different jobs, in two very different systems, is a losing game already. But if we have to, the easy answer is: Republicans have in fact stood up to President Donald Trump on policy — repeatedly. I listed  seven different revolts in one column this summer. That’s not counting the time earlier this year when Senate Republicans undermined the president during the government shutdown. Nor is it counting all the things that Trump has tried to do by executive action because he couldn’t get a Republican Congress to pass what he wanted. 
So when a news article says that an American analogue to the Tory revolt would need to include Republican senators such as Lamar Alexander and Mitt Romney, I think back to March, when Alexander, Romney and 10 other Republican senators voted against Trump’s declaration of an emergency over his border wall. Granted, in that case and others Republican dissenters haven’t had the votes to win. But that’s not because they weren’t willing to take a stand. 
In many cases, Trump is simply doing what congressional Republicans want, not the other way around. That’s true for tax and budget policies, for judges and executive-branch appointments, for guns, abortion and more. Yes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sometimes says that he’d put a bill on the floor if Trump would agree to sign it. But he can do that safely because he knows that Trump will side with Republican-aligned interest groups on most policy questions.
One exception might be Trump’s trade war. But trade simply isn’t a core issue for most Republicans. In fact, one reason the party doesn’t split the way the Conservatives have in Britain is that it isn’t divided on big issues the way that the Tories are divided over Europe. Back when Republicans still had moderate and liberal senators, they split on plenty of things — including, notably, the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. The reason they haven’t split over Trump’s Supreme Court picks isn’t that they’re more loyal to him than they were to Ronald Reagan in 1987. It’s because they sincerely want the kind of justices he’s been nominating. So on less central issues, internal conflict doesn’t threaten a more serious rupture.
And that leads to the real point: Republican dissent isn’t usually about putting country over party or vice versa; it’s about honest differences of opinion about what’s good for the nation. 
There is one big exception here: Congressional Republicans have been protecting Trump from accusations of corruption, obstruction of justice and more. They have, for the most part, backed his efforts to block routine oversight of his conflicts of interest and general lawlessness. Some of them may honestly think that his behavior is acceptable and that Congress is overstepping its bounds. But most are probably choosing partisanship over their congressional responsibilities in this case. Even so, it’s unlikely that many of them really think Trump is damaging the nation the way that dissident Tories think a no-deal Brexit would damage the U.K. 
But overall? Republicans stand up to Trump on policy all the time. That’s not because they’re especially brave or patriotic; it’s just how the U.S. system works.

Those portfolios could use a little sprucing up.

The U.S. bond market is having a September to remember as far as debt sales are concerned. Investors ought to use this borrowing binge to their advantage.
Investment-grade companies issued some $74 billion of debt last week, a record for any comparable period since at least 1972, and it looks as if an additional $35 billion is  on the way in the coming days. More than $11 billion of asset-backed securities and commercial- and residential-mortgage debt is being pitched to investors, Bloomberg News’s Adam Tempkin  reported. The leveraged-loan market has 12 bank meetings lined up, and a high-yield deal or two seems likely.
Much of the focus of this borrowing spree has been on the companies themselves, and rightly so. After all, it’s not every day that a company like Deere & Co. can set a record for the lowest-yielding 30-year investment-grade corporate debt, or Apple Inc.  issues long bonds despite holding more than $200 billion of cash and investment securities. As I’ve written before, companies’ decision-making is  fairly simple: They see low yields, and they sell bonds. 
However, this should also be a time for investors to get introspective. Even with the wide swing in benchmark U.S. yields, spreads in corporate credit markets have remained remarkably steady. Since the start of August, yields have declined about 50 basis points on the 30-year Treasury and 40 points on the 10-year. Yet during that same period, the average investment-grade spread is up only 10 basis points. It’s roughly the same in the high-yield market, where spreads are below their 2019 average. Leveraged-loan prices have barely budged in recent weeks.

In other words, there’s still time to clean up bond portfolios heading into the final months of 2019. I imagine it can be hard for investors to deviate from their strategies, considering the staggering total-return figures across debt markets this year. But looking at the gains in the context of recent history starts to paint a clearer picture:
Clearly, speculative-grade securities aren’t flying quite as high as they might initially appear. By contrast, the fact that the asset-backed securities index, stuffed with triple-A rated obligations, is quietly having its best year in recent memory indicates investors’ preference for higher-quality bonds.

Of course, the blistering rally in investment-grade corporate bonds can’t be separated from the huge increase in negative-yielding debt worldwide. Its proliferation has created a conundrum for investors in Europe and Japan because even 10-year Treasuries yield less than zero after hedging for currency risk. But in both regions, the yield turns positive by picking up an average U.S. corporate bond. Tetsuo Ishihara, a U.S. macro strategist at Mizuho Securities USA who has his finger on the pulse of the Japanese markets, said in a recent report that he had heard “retail consensus in Japan is that the US 30y is heading to 0%” over the next several years. As a result, “US IG is also a target for both retail and wholesale.”
Back in the U.S., some big money managers are advocating the “up in quality” trade (or, at least, voicing concerns about riskier securities). In a Financial Times Q&A about negative-yielding debt — with questions like “Is there a bubble in the bond market?” and “Will there be a damaging crash?” — JPMorgan Asset Management’s Bob Michele stressed that “Investors should improve the credit quality of their holdings and concentrate primarily on positive yielding investment grade rated bonds.” BlackRock Inc.’s Rick Rieder said the riskiest areas and those offering the least value are “loan markets, especially in sectors where credit quality and covenants are weak.” Daniel Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., answered the same question by pointing to parts of the credit markets with deteriorating fundamentals and investor protections.
None of this is to say that riskier debt will deliver imminent losses. In fact, high-quality sovereign debt was the big loser on Monday, with yields rising on Treasuries and German bunds ahead of a potentially hawkish European Central Bank meeting and amid speculation that Germany is considering a “shadow budget” to bolster public investments, providing a much-needed fiscal boost to its economy.
The slow-but-steady economic growth since the financial crisis, combined with ever-accommodating central banks, has made reaching for yield the  obvious trade. Sure, some energy companies crashed and burned along the way, and retailers have floundered, with discount merchandise chain Fred’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday and Forever 21 Inc. perhaps up next. Yet by and large, companies have endured during the longest expansion on record, aided by low interest rates. Fixed-income investors have been rewarded handsomely along the way. 
The reasons to believe that trend can’t last are beginning to pile up. There’s the yield curve, of course, which has been inverted for just about all of the past three months. But notably, as Shawn Donnan wrote for Bloomberg Businessweek, recession is becoming a reality in at least some corners of America, like manufacturing and agriculture. U.S. consumers have been a resilient part of the recovery, but as Komal Sri-Kumar noted in a Bloomberg Opinion  column last week, their spending habits are hardly a leading indicator. And their outlook for the economy is slumping.
Bond investors, who clearly fear nothing more than a liquidity crunch during a rush to the exits, probably shouldn’t wait to see whether recession fears were overblown or warranted. This month’s supply offers a convenient opportunity for them to tidy up their holdings and position for a time when making money in fixed income isn’t quite so easy.

Kravis was watching just steps from the court with KKR colleagues Joe Bae, Pete Stavros and Tagar Olson as Nadal defeated Daniil Medvedev Sunday in an epic 5-hour match to win his 19th Grand Slam. Also sitting court side, in arguably the best seats in Arthur Ashe stadium, were Bill Ackman, Ralph Lauren and Howard Lutnick.

Lutnick was in a suite with Carl Icahn and Eminence Capital’s Ricky Sandler on Friday night, and with his sons on Sunday. Wearing a charcoal gray hoodie and jeans, Lutnick shared his first memories of the U.S. Open, when the tournament was still held at Forest Hills before moving to Flushing Meadows in 1978.
“We didn’t really have money for tickets, so me and my little brother would wait outside,” he recalled. “I knew all the names of all the players so in the early rounds, I would find players who were way down in the list and we’d go running up to them and get their autograph.""
“They’d ask ‘Are you going to come in and root for us?’ and we’d say ‘Sorry, we don’t have any tickets.’ So they’d say ‘Hold on,’ go inside, come back and give us a couple,” said Lutnick, who recalled watching such past champions as John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg and his friend, Dick Stockton.
Sitting ahead of the KKR contingent in the front row was hedge fund manager John Paulson and behind him, Michael Tennenbaum, the former Bear Stearns executive who authored a book titled “Risk: Living on the Edge.”
Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones during the Men’s Finals match
Like Lutnick, Tennenbaum experienced his first US Open at Forest Hills. “You’d see the tennis champs going back on the subway, like Roscoe Tanner,” said Tennenbaum, dressed in a navy t-shirt, colorful striped pants and bold red shoes to match his eye-glasses.
Nadal was presented his $3.85 million prize money check by Jennifer Piepszak, JPMorgan’s CFO.
The usual contingent of Hollywood actors were also sprinkled throughout the crowd, including Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones and Mariska Hargitay.
Financiers including Stephen Schwarzman and Kip DeVeer, as well as the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle, showed up for Saturday’s women’s final. It was won by 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu, who upset crowd favorite Serena Williams 6-3, 7-5 to become the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam title.

“I was sad to see Serena lose, but she did come back like a champion from down 5-1"" in the second set, said BentallGreenOak’s Sonny Kalsi.
After the women’s final, guests including Olivia Flatto, Robert Wolf and Marathon’s Bruce Richards dined on burrata and beef tenderloin at the International Tennis Hall of Fame’s Legends Ball honoring Rod Laver. Co-chairs of the event at Cipriani 42nd Street included Jody and John Arnhold, Andrea and Erik Lisher, Judy and Russ Fradin, Fred Luddy, Debbie and Ajay Nagpal, Rob Pohly and Barbara and Gary Tolman.

127,,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2019-09-08/ftc-fines-youtube-for-violating-kids-privacy-what-it-means,"September 8, 2019, 5:30 PM EDT","Hollywood Torrent: YouTube gets a speeding ticket, and the world moves on","Good afternoon from Los Angeles, wherever you may be.
The Federal Trade Commission fined YouTube $170 million for violating children's privacy, the second major fine against a technology company for collecting kids' data. This is the largest fine for a child privacy violation in the history of the FTC, and an irrelevant sum of money for a company that generates more than $10 billion a year in revenue.
The penalty is ""like giving a small speeding ticket to a billionaire,"" said Brenda Bisner, a senior executive at Kidoodle.TV, a family-focused streaming channel. (Kiddoodle.TV wanted the FTC to strip all kids' content from YouTube, which would benefit Kidoodle.TV.)
While society welcomes any chance to assail large technology companies, and government's meek treatment of them, multiple people told me to disregard the fine and look at the conditions.
YouTube promised to promote its Kids app, a safer version of YouTube that has a tiny audience relative to big YouTube. It promised to limit data collection and turn off commenting on videos aimed at kids. And it promised to invest $100 million in video creators who make videos for kids.
While $100 million is small in the grand scheme of YouTube, it signals that YouTube is very concerned about the effects of a fourth condition. YouTube vowed it would no longer sell personalized advertising on kids’ videos.
What does that mean? TV networks sell advertising against demographics – say, women between the age of 18 and 49. YouTube has far more detailed data about its viewers than TV networks. It has used that data to sell advertising targeted at specific viewers. It won’t do that anymore for videos aimed at kids. Instead, it will just sell what's called contextualized advertising – advertising based on the programming (say, toy videos).
This sounds technical, but YouTubers say it is a very big deal. “Our expectation is that a significant amount of revenue will go away in the short term,"" says Chris Williams, whose company pocket.watch works with some of the biggest kids' creators on the internet.
Naturally, many kids’ privacy activists are still unhappy. The two Democrats at the FTC didn’t feel the punishment went nearly far enough.  YouTube can still host all the kids’ content it wants. It doesn’t have to screen the videos for suitability before its users upload them. It can still sell ads against those videos.
YouTube will rely on artificial intelligence to take down inappropriate videos. And while YouTube’s AI is excellent -- it is right 99 percent of the time -- there is little margin for error with children.
So where does that leave us? YouTube got slapped on the wrist. Critics say it's not enough, YouTube creators say it's going to hurt and YouTube is happy to be done with this particular investigation (though more await).
Kids are always going to see the occasional inappropriate piece of content, and the vast majority of creators are trying to do the right thing. YouTube will work hard to clean the site up under the current regulatory framework. Barring a change in the law to hold open platforms legally responsible for what users upload, the government is putting the responsibility on parents. – Lucas Shaw
The Recording Industry Association of America released its mid-year report this week, and it paints a rosy picture. U.S. music sales climbed 18 percent in the year’s first six months to $5.4 billion (retail).
Despite murmurs of a slowdown in streaming, industry sales are on track for another year of strong growth, and the first half doesn’t include new records from Taylor Swift or Adele.
In case you didn't realize it, streaming is the music industry. I’ve probably typed this before, but the latest report is staggering. Just five years ago, digital downloads (aka iTunes) accounted for 37 percent and physical (CD sales and vinyl) accounted for 32 percent. Streaming was No. 3. Now it looks like this:
The music industry is dependent on paid streaming, to be specific. More than 60 million people pay for a streaming service, triple the figure from three years ago. Advertising-supported services like YouTube and Pandora are tiny relative to paid -- in terms of revenue, not users.
 The No. 1 movie in the world is “It: Chapter 2.” The movie grossed $90 million in North America this weekend, a shade below early projections and far less than its predecessor.. The nearly three-hour run time doesn't help. But the film is still a smash, grossing  $95 million overseas as well.
The No. 1 song in the world is Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts.” Rob Harvilla wrote a very fun piece examining why a two-year-old song toped the charts instead of one of the Minnesota rapper’s newer singles.

But as Birgit Jennen, Patrick Donahue and Arne Delfs explain, it’s an especially high-risk strategy for Berlin when its export-dependent economy is flirting with recession.Bolsonaro’s Words Are the Sparks as Brazil’s Farmers Burn AmazoniaThe Amazon has been burning for weeks, and many fires in one of Brazil’s most ravaged states, Rondonia, were lit by small farmers who eke out a living on the jungle’s fringes with slash-and-burn agriculture. David Biller and Bruce Douglas write that President Jair Bolsonaro’s explicit endorsement has emboldened them to burn more than they have in years.
Democrats Tout Similarly Bold Climate Plans to Willing AudienceEven as they presented ambitious proposals to reduce carbon emissions to a national audience, Democratic candidates for president tried to balance the boldness of their plans with the need for simplifying a complex scientific problem for voters. As Gregory Korte explains, that meant the conversation was often about cheeseburgers, light bulbs and plastic straws.

Cathay's structure that favors foreign-born executives was always poor practice, and the appointment of Patrick Healy shows the custom is breaking down too slowly, David Fickling writes in Bloomberg Opinion. By overlooking deserving locals like Ivan Chu and Michelle Low as replacement for Chairman John Slosar, Cathay's owner Swire missed an opportunity to defend Hong Kong's apolitical business values, even as it risks angering local consumers and China.
Don't get too excited by the market rally, Robert Burgess writes for Bloomberg Opinion. The challenges facing the global economy aren't beginning to lift such as the trade war. It also shouldn't be a surprise the services part of the economy has been holding up. If anything, it shows how markets can generate violent moves on relatively benign news developments when positioning becomes too extreme.

Denver International Airport’s decision to terminate a contract with private developers to build a “Great Hall” at one of its terminals is proving costly to investors who bought about $190 million municipal bonds to help finance the project.
The securities were sold at a premium and borrowing provisions allow Great Hall Partners LLC to redeem the debt at par plus accrued interest upon cancellation of the development agreement. Because the debt was trading for 115 cents on the dollar, the prices swiftly dropped by more than 10% after the airport announced last month that it was terminating a $1.8 billion contract with the consortium to renovate the main terminal and operate retail concessions for three decades.
It follows an instance last year when for-profit health system HCA Healthcare Inc. bought Mission Health System, an Asheville, North Carolina-based non-profit, triggering a par call on Mission’s premium bonds. The losses imposed by Denver Great Hall and Mission could cause buyers to shun new deals with similar provisions.
“This should be a wake-up call for the industry,” said Fred Cohen, former director of municipal bond trading at AllianceBernstein Holding LP. “Buyers haven’t focused on it because it hasn’t happened that often, but it happens every once in a while and investors pay the price.”
The steep price drop illustrates a rarely seen risk in the $3.8 trillion municipal-bond market that’s grown as tumbling interest rates push prices of many securities well above face value. Since many investors still want debt that carry 5% coupons because it’s the easiest to resell, more than 70% of the $232 billion of municipal bonds issued this year have been sold at a premium, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors should demand that borrowers issuing new premium bonds agree to pay the amortized cost of the debt, reflecting how much money they’ve lent to the issuer, rather than par in the event of an extraordinary redemption, Cohen said.
Denver officials in August notified the partnership that includes Ferrovial Airports International Ltd, Saunders Construction Inc. and JLC Infrastructure, that it was terminating the development agreement for the Great Hall Project in the airport’s Jeppesen Terminal, which had been beset by delays and cost overruns.
Nuveen LLC held about $20 million of the Great Hall bonds as of July 31. John Miller, who oversees more than $150 billion state and local government bonds as head of municipal investments, said the firm was disappointed at Denver International Airport’s decision to terminate the agreement.
The action “will result in bondholders being damaged and the equity participant possibly benefiting from a make whole equity call. It is unknown how much the developer will be paid to go away as a result of the termination payment, meanwhile, bondholders may be offered par,” Miller said in an email. “DIA believes the best course of action is to take over as developer because the project has experienced significant delays and cost overruns. While the majority of bondholders have supported DIA deals in the past, its purported course of action is not a viable solution for bondholders as this action would hurt long-term investors in the airport.”
Adam Banker, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments, which owned about $20 million of the bonds at the end of July, said the company doesn’t comment on specific holdings.
The decision to terminate the contract was in the best interest of the airport, passengers and the airport’s investors, said Stacey Stegman, an airport spokeswoman.
“The bottom line is that these are not the city’s or airport’s bonds,"" Stegman wrote in an email. ""In the case of termination, a ‘termination for convenience’ placed Great Hall Partners’ bondholders/accredited investors in the best position.""
The city will make a termination payment to Great Hall Partners and the Public Finance Authority which issued the debt and it will be their responsibility to pay bondholders, she said.
Prices on the biggest maturity of the bonds, a $132 million block maturing in 2049, dropped to 104 cents on the dollar from 115 cents the day before. The partnership issued the maturity in December 2017 at 113 cents on the dollar. As of mid August the amortized cost of $132 million Denver Great Hall bonds maturing in 2049 was about 111 cents on the dollar or $147 million.
Buyers have accepted “extraordinary” redemption provisions at par not only because they’re triggered infrequently, but because of a bull market for tax exempt debt where demand far exceeds supply, Cohen said. Investors have poured $43 billion into municipal bond funds through August, an almost five-fold increase compared to the same period last year. State and local debt issuance has increased about 9%.
Premium bonds are desirable for institutional investors because they outperform discount bonds when rates rise and are less costly to trade. In general, revenue bonds issued for specific projects such as hospitals, have extraordinary redemption provisions, while general obligation bonds don’t, Cohen said.

Whether Zelenskiy decides to give up a key MH-17 witness will shed light on his policy toward eastern Ukraine.
Prisoner swap has implications for the MH17 investigation.

For months, Ukraine and Russia have been negotiating a major prisoner exchange that would clear the slate for substantive negotiations on ending the war in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-supported separatists have set up two unrecognized statelets, the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics  (DNR and LNR). But so far, despite a series of false alarms, the swap hasn’t taken place; if it does, look for this name among those traded to Russia: Volodymyr Tsemakh. 
The presence of Tsemakh, the former DNR air defense commander and a key witness in the investigation of the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014, on the list of traded prisoners would send an important signal concerning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s intentions in further talks with Russia. It would help understand whether Zelenskiy plans to stick to his predecessor Petro Poroshenko’s implacable stance or make painful concessions in order to end the war.
About 35 people held by each side are likely to be traded. Ukraine would get back the 24 sailors Russia seized in the Kerch Strait last November, several activists arrested in Russian-annexed Crimea, including the best-known of them, film director Oleg Sentsov, and two people sentenced to long prison terms for allegedly fighting against Russian troops in Chechnya in the 1990s. Russia would likely get Kirill Vyshinsky, editor of the Ukrainian subsidiary of the propaganda agency RIA Novosti, and a number of separatist fighters, including those the Kremlin maintains were “furloughed” Russian service members who had fought against Ukrainian forces.
The two countries first came close to doing the exchange before Ukraine’s parliamentary election in July. It could have been seen as a goodwill gesture from the Kremlin ahead of the peace talks, but the political moment was inopportune. The party of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s friend and ally Viktor Medvedchuk was running against Zelenskiy’s  new political party. Medvedchuk was heavily involved in the exchange talks so a successful swap could be interpreted as Putin helping his friend rather than Zelenskiy. Besides, an international maritime tribunal had demanded Russia free the sailors unconditionally and trading them could have hurt Zelenskiy's support during the elections.
The deal never came together but the talks continued so that Putin and Zelenskiy could meet in the so-called Normandy format – with French President Emmanuel  Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel mediating – in September, per Macron’s proposal. On August 30, a false alarm in a Facebook repost by Ukraine’s newly appointed, inexperienced prosecutor general sent relatives of the Ukrainian captives to one of Kyiv’s two airports to wait for a plane with their loved ones to land. No such flight had been scheduled, however. Something had come apart.
A number of Ukrainian media and bloggers, including some I personally know and trust, have since advanced the theory that Russia had scuppered the deal with a last-minute demand that Ukraine give up Tsemakh, abducted by  Ukrainian intelligence from separatist-held territory about two months ago. 
Because of his involvement in the DNR air defense in 2014, Tsemakh potentially knows about the downing of MH-17, which an international investigation led by Dutch prosecutors established was hit with a Buk missile from separatist territory. Russia has been adamant that it wasn’t involved in the downing of the plane, in which 298 people, most of them Dutch, perished, but the investigative team has named three Russian suspects in the case. The Ukrainian news site thebabel.net has published a purported leaked  letter from the lead investigator, Fred Westerbeke, telling Ukrainian prosecutors on August 30 that Tsemakh was considered a suspect rather than a witness and that it would be a  good idea to hold him for further questioning.
The Dutch daily NRC wrote on Monday that it had confirmed the letter’s authenticity but that, according to the Dutch Public Prosecution Service, Ukraine was free to trade Tsemakh because he was “in a Ukrainian cell for a Ukrainian case.”
Russian sources, official and unofficial, have never mentioned Tsemakh  in the context of the planned prisoner exchange. On Monday, the Moscow daily Kommersant, which has good Kremlin sources, reported that the exchange had been held up because of legal issues, such as whether the Ukrainian sailors would be sent home with original or copies of their Russian criminal case files and what the official basis would be for the trade. (Neither Russian nor Ukrainian laws regulate prisoner exchanges with other countries, and citizenship issues are complex in a number of the captives’ cases.)
The understandable dearth of official information about the exchange makes it hard to determine exactly what’s going on. Both sides, however, say that the negotiations are continuing; both Putin and Zelenskiy appear to be loath to disappoint Macron and Merkel, who would like to hold peace talks this month. Without the exchange, the talks will be all but hopeless: both sides need to demonstrate willingness to hold a constructive discussion and compromise if necessary.
If the exchange takes place and Tsemakh is sent to Russia, it will mean Zelenskiy is willing to use his considerable political capital – 70% of Ukrainians support him – to prioritize humanitarian matters over holding Russia responsible for its depredations in east Ukraine. Such an approach would make it likely that he would also favor a broad amnesty for the separatists once the “people’s  republics” rejoin Ukraine, something Moscow has been demanding. Trading Tsemakh would also signal that Zelenskiy’s desire to end the war – something his voters overwhelmingly support – trumps all other considerations.
If Tsemakh is not part of the swap, that can mean one of two things: That the Russian demand for him was a false rumor or that Putin is impatient enough to restart the peace process to let the MH-17 investigation acquire a key person of interest. If the exchange doesn’t take place at all, it will stymie the peace process;  Zelenskiy will be forced to let the war drag on without even a realistic hope of freezing the conflict to prevent further deaths.
For the young Ukrainian president, the exchange is a test; whatever the outcome, it will set the course of the game he’ll have to play for the next four years against vastly more experienced Putin.

Past mistakes about China are too numerous to mention. When it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, many thought China would liberalize. Since Japan, Taiwan and South Korea had all gone on to become full-fledged democracies after periods of autocracy, the pattern was clear: Once they were fairly wealthy, the growing middle classes demanded a say in their government. At the time, it hardly seemed crazy to believe China might go down a similar path.
That turned out to be wrong. It was also conventional wisdom, circa 2010, that China was due for an economic crack-up. That didn’t happen, either.

David Koch, the industrialist and libertarian who used his fortune to transform American politics while also donating more than $1 billion to philanthropic causes, has died. He was 79.
Koch died after years of fighting various illnesses, according to a statement from Koch Industries on Friday. He’d been diagnosed with prostate cancer 27 years ago and initially doctors said he had just a few years to live.
“It is with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of my brother David,” Charles Koch said in a statement. “Anyone who worked with David surely experienced his giant personality and passion for life.”
Koch, whose net worth of about $59 billion in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index tied him with his brother as the world’s seventh-richest person, derived most of his wealth from a 42% stake in Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, which has annual revenue of about $110 billion. It is one of the nation’s largest closely held companies, and its spectacular growth included the 2005 acquisition of Georgia-Pacific for $21 billion.
A resident of New York’s Upper East Side and the city’s richest person, Koch once joked that Koch Industries was “the biggest company you’ve never heard of.” The conglomerate has interests ranging from oil and ranching to farming and the manufacturing of electrical components.
But he and Charles Koch, 83, became better known for pushing their views than their business acumen, pumping millions into conservative causes and candidates. The operation they built includes more than 700 donors who give $100,000 or more a year and a group called Americans for Prosperity that has chapters in 35 states. It’s rivaled only by the Republican Party in its influence on the conservative agenda in the U.S.

The Koch brothers and other wealthy donors were able to expand their influence on elections following the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision that paved the way for unbridled spending, both directly and indirectly, by outside groups.
“David Koch’s imprint on the American political scene will endure long into the future,” said Daniel Schulman, who wrote “Sons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America’s Most Powerful and Private Dynasty,” published in 2014. “The Kochs helped to give rise to the age of the mega-donor, an era of unprecedented political spending in which wealthy individuals, as well as corporations, can influence politics as never before. His political legacy is huge.”
Koch money incubated a generation of political figures, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
Yet all those men but Walker worked for President Donald Trump, who has upended the free-market views the Kochs have tried to foster within the Republican Party. That has prompted clashes with Trump, especially on trade and immigration policy.
The brothers didn’t support Trump in his 2016 campaign, although they praised his efforts to cut taxes and regulations. After Charles Koch criticized Trump’s approach to trade and his leadership style during a donor retreat in 2018, the president tweeted that the brothers “have become a total joke in real Republican circles.”
Their political network by then was backing away from reflexive support for Republicans, such as then-Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who arguably strayed too far from the brothers’ vision of free-market orthodoxy. Cramer nevertheless beat an incumbent Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp, for a Senate seat.
Days after the midterms that year, when the Democrats retook the House despite millions in Koch spending for Republicans, the network called for a more bipartisan focus on what unites Americans with work on criminal-justice reform, immigration and promotion of free trade.

Koch was the vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party in 1980. But as his health failed, he became less prominent in the Koch political operation. Charles Koch has served as the philosophical and hands-on leader, while David was chairman of the foundation that oversees AFP, their flagship political organ.
In June 2018, Charles Koch told company employees that his brother would step down from the business and political empires because of health problems. Charles Koch’s letter didn’t provide details, although he noted that David Koch had announced in October 2016 that he’d been hospitalized the previous summer.
“Unfortunately, these issues have not been resolved and his health has continued to deteriorate,” the letter said.
Koch was diagnosed with prostate cancer more than two decades ago. Through personal donations and contributions from the David H. Koch Foundation, he pledged or contributed more than $1 billion to cancer research, medical centers, educational institutions, arts and cultural institutions, and to assist public-policy organizations, according to his official biography.
“A lot of billionaires make their contribution and their name is on the board of directors, but they have no intention of showing up to the meetings,” said New York philanthropist Adrienne Arsht. “He came to meetings. He was always hands-on.”
Arsht said David Koch never acted like Manhattan’s wealthiest person.
“He was most understated,” she said. “There was nothing about anything that he did that made you think he was anything but a man from Kansas.”
But the Koch brothers played a massive role in politics, helping shape state and federal policy.
“By lavishly underwriting candidates, policy organizations, and advocacy groups -- often through untraceable donations -- they have pulled American politics toward their own arch-conservative, pro-business, anti-tax, and anti-regulatory agenda,” Jane Mayer, who has covered the Koch brothers for the New Yorker, wrote in June 2018.
The brothers were credited with helping underwrite the limited-government Tea Party movement that helped Republicans take control of Congress in 2010. “They helped to unleash a political insurgency that in turn set the stage for our present state of extreme polarization, an outcome I don’t think they expected or desired,” Schulman said.

The brothers favored ending the minimum wage, eliminating so-called “corporate welfare” for new factories and stadiums and backed union-weakening laws. While their efforts got the most attention in Washington, AFP’s nearly nationwide on-the-ground presence meant their influence was felt in state and local matters that included fights against gas-tax increases and referendums on local projects.
Organizations that the brothers help found or fund, such as the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and the Manhattan Institute, have supported some of their ideas through studies and media interviews given by resident scholars.
Characterizing himself as a social liberal, David Koch was pro-choice when it came to abortion and supportive of same-sex marriage and stem-cell research. Further confounding liberal critics, the brothers supported efforts to free nonviolent prisoners and overhaul sentencing, changes they argued would reduce recidivism, save taxpayers money and remove barriers to opportunity.
“He believed he had a responsibility to a world that had given him so many opportunities to succeed,” his family said in a statement Friday. “David’s philanthropic dedication to education, the arts and cancer research will have a lasting impact on innumerable lives.”
He opposed the Affordable Care Act and was skeptical about the need for government to deal with global warming, giving money to groups that raised questions about the scientific consensus that climate change is occurring. In 2011, David Koch called then-President Barack Obama “the most radical president we’ve ever had as a nation,” pointing to damage he thought Obama had done to the free-enterprise system.
David Hamilton Koch, whose grandfather was a Dutch immigrant, was born on May 3, 1940, in Wichita to Fred and Mary Robinson Koch. Their father, after helping Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin develop oil-refining plants, became an early supporter of the anti-communist John Birch Society. That group was often in conflict with the brand of conservatism that fueled the rise of figures like former President Richard Nixon, so the family’s politics have long been an uneasy fit in the Republican Party’s mainstream.
David and his twin brother, William, were the youngest of four siblings. David and Charles successfully fought Fred and William in court for control of the company.
“David and I happily reconciled our past business differences 20 years ago,” William said in a statement Friday. “He was my best man at my wedding. Our spouses and children have become good friends. David had strong principles, great character, and strength. He was an outstanding human and he was my best friend.”
David Koch attended Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. He went on to study engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1962 and a master’s a year later. Koch, who was 6-foot-5, averaged 21 points a game on MIT’s basketball team and held the single-game scoring record of 41 points that stood for 46 years, according to his official biography. He also played for the Boston Rugby Football Club.
Koch worked initially as a consultant and engineer for firms such as Arthur D. Little before joining the family business in 1970. Charles had taken over following the death of their father three years earlier.
The company then was an oil-refining business worth about $70 million. The brothers turned it into an industrial behemoth with interests in oil refining, pipelines, commodities trading, ranching and paper and pulp products that include brands such as Dixie Cups and Brawny paper towels.
While Charles ran Koch Industries from Wichita, David opened the company’s New York office in 1970, rising to executive vice president as his brother reigned as chairman and chief executive officer.
“David was smart, really smart,” said Frayda Levin, a Koch network donor and former New Jersey book distributor who served with him on the board of Americans for Prosperity. “He could hone in on any issue and ask insightful questions.”
Using his New York base, David lavished money on museums and arts institutions such as the $100 million he gave to the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, which was renamed the David H. Koch Theater.
He also supported medical research, especially after he survived a USAir accident in 1991 at Los Angeles International Airport. Shortly afterward, he discovered he had prostate cancer, a disease that afflicted his brothers.
“When you’re the only one who survived in the front of the plane and everyone else died — yeah, you think, ‘My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose,” he told portfolio.com.
The David H.

David Koch’s death early Friday marks the end of an era in the worlds of business, politics, philanthropy and high society. For Koch Industries, the conglomerate he helped his brother Charles transform into the second-largest privately held U.S. company, the founding family retains firm control as a generational shift takes hold.
“Nothing changes,” Koch spokeswoman Christin Fernandez said in an email. “David’s shares remain with his family.”
Koch Industries won’t detail its succession plan beyond saying that one is in place, and that roles are filled by those most qualified. One candidate is Charles’s son, Chase Koch, 42. He’s the only member of the family from the next generation that works at the company. His sister Elizabeth Koch runs a publishing house, Catapult.
Chase oversees Koch Disruptive Technologies, a venture capital subsidiary that has invested in futuristic technologies including ultrasound-guided surgery and metal 3-D printing.
David Koch, who was 79, and Charles, 83, built Koch Industries from a minor oil player into a powerhouse with annual revenue of about $110 billion from businesses such as oil refining, pipelines, commodities trading, ranching and paper pulp that are at the heart of the American economy.
The two brothers -- with stakes of about 42% each -- have been the central figures in a firm as vast as it is stable. Charles has headed the company since 1967 and remains chief executive officer. Before retiring last year, David led Koch Chemical Technology Group.
The company is worth about $137 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. David’s stake comprised the bulk of his $59 billion fortune, which tied him with his brother as the world’s seventh-richest person.

Chase Koch took a somewhat unusual path to the firm. Unlike his father and uncle, both of whom studied chemical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chase studied marketing at Texas A&M University. After graduating, he spent several years in Austin trying to break into the city’s emerging tech scene. He moonlighted in a classic rock band covering Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd tracks.
Chase Koch
When he returned to Wichita to rejoin Koch Industries, Chase began a rotation of high-level jobs, including stints in mergers and acquisitions, tax structuring, agronomics and trading. It was designed as an MBA-like experience to familiarize him with various parts of the operation.
If he does take over eventually, he’ll inherit a company with an impressive track record. His grandfather Fred Koch was an MIT-trained chemical engineer whose innovations in oil refining helped the firm flourish after he founded it in 1940. After his death in 1967, Charles took the helm, and David joined in 1970. At the time, the company was still a relative minnow that focused on oil refining and services.
Under their stewardship, Koch Industries reinvested about 90% of profits back into the business as it expanded into new sectors, such as fertilizers, fabrics and forestry products. Their purchase of Georgia-Pacific for $21 billion remains one of the biggest corporate acquisitions, and cemented Koch Industries’ position atop the ranks of the most valuable private companies whose main expertise was in turning raw materials into consumer products.
With David Koch’s death, his nephew’s role at the company is likely to draw more attention, as will the heirs who inherit shares. David is survived by his wife, Julia Flesher Koch, and their children David Jr., Mary, and John. Julia could become one of the richest and most influential figures in corporate America, assuming she inherits control of the estate.

She has largely avoided the spotlight since marrying David Koch in 1996. She was born in Indianola, Iowa, in the early 1960s, and her family owned a furniture store, the New York Times reported in a 1998 profile. She moved to Arkansas eight years later when her parents opened a store in Conway, north of Little Rock. She attended the University of Central Arkansas before taking a job as an assistant to fashion designer Adolfo Sardina and ultimately being introduced to her future husband in 1991.

History is littered with examples of family ventures laid low by succession problems, but those familiar with the Kochs say they’re prepared.
“It is hard to see any scenario where this company falls apart or does poorly for any extended period of time,” said Christopher Leonard, author of “Kochland,” a new book about the firm. “They built a machine that will endure.”

A waiter patrolled the deck pouring rose, while inside the house Charles Oakley spiced jerk chicken and sauteed purple cabbage.
On Wednesday evening, Oakley, the former New York Knicks power forward, was in charge of dinner at the home of CIBC’s Eric Price in Bridgehampton. Price bought Oakley’s services in an auction at a charity golf tournament, and picked a late August afternoon to bring him to his Norman Jaffe home to prepare a kid-friendly feast for friends including Mark Black of Corvid Peak Capital, CIBC’s Fred Gourtay and Brian Eizenstat.

The kitchen table was filled with other former professional athletes: OJ Anderson and Stephen Baker, who both played for the New York Giants, and John Starks of the Knicks. Price rented the house next door for their stay, and arranged for them to play golf at Sebonack and Atlantic before dinner.
Black’s 4-year-old daughter liked Oakley’s corn bread. The former Knick-turned-very-tall chef also made ribs, mac and cheese, green beans, potato salad and a peach and blackberry tart, all with very little help.

Well, Price did melt some butter, but mainly he made sure the kids got to meet the athletes.
“Stand on the stairs so you look tall,” Anderson told the daughter of Lesley and David Schulhof. “You look like a princess.”

The Prices’ donation to host the experience supports a college scholarship fund started by Anderson. This year, 24 graduating high school seniors received grants of about $3,500 each, according to Marc Goldberg, who helps run the New Jersey component of Anderson’s foundation.

When dinner was served on the back deck, Anderson thanked the Prices for hosting and declared himself “first taster.” He also explained why he started the scholarship.
“I was born and raised in Florida, always wishing and hoping that one day I could get out of the projects and make something of myself and help my family,” Anderson said. “Football gave me an opportunity to do that. University of Miami gave me an opportunity to do that. I realize I can give back and be a role model to kids.”
Price started working with athletes as a coordinator of CIBC’s charity trading day. He brought several athletes including Anderson to the Robin Hood Foundation benefit in May.

GoldenTree Asset Management LP said in a letter Friday that only a seasoned operational CEO can properly execute the company’s strategic plan, in contrast to current CEO Eurico Teles, whom the firm called an “accomplished lawyer.”
“We now fear the long-term future of the company is in serious jeopardy because of poor decision-making, disappointing financial and operational performance, and a failure to apply important corporate governance principles enshrined in the plan of reorganization,” GoldenTree wrote.
Oi shares fell 2.8% to 1.06 reais at 1:21 p.m. Monday in Sao Paulo trading, extending last week’s 29% drop -- the worst weekly retreat since 2016.
The company on Wednesday posted a loss of 1.56 billion reais ($390 million) and said it burned about 2 billion reais of cash in the second quarter. Investors, still recovering from the company’s $19 billion debt restructuring in December 2017, fretted when Chief Financial Officer Carlos Brandao mentioned a potential capital increase as an option to boost liquidity. GoldenTree is also asking that Brandao be replaced.
The Rio de Janeiro-based company issued a statement Friday evening expressing confidence in its cost-control efforts and planned sale of noncore assets. Investors, nevertheless, have continued to pressure the stock.
Oi’s shareholding structure changed completely in the last two years, as a result of its efforts to restructure its huge pile of debt. GoldenTree, formerly among Oi’s biggest bondholders, became the top shareholder after the 2017 restructuring. It holds 15% of the equity.
Teles took the helm in November 2017, after the former CEO suddenly exited, and got creditors’ approval for the restructuring plan less than a month later. The agreement required that the C-level management stay for at least one year, while the plan was implemented.
“Cash is being burnt at a faster-than-expected pace,” said Leonardo Rufino, a Rio de Janeiro-based portfolio manager at Pacifico Gestao de Recursos who has a small position in Oi on his portfolio.
While Brandao reiterated the company was “fully on track” to sell its stake in Unitel SA, Angola’s largest wireless operator, in the fourth quarter, he also mentioned “issuing secured debt, capital raise and vendor financing” as alternatives the company is analyzing in case the expected sale falls apart.
That was enough to spark a two-day stock rout that wiped out almost a third of the company’s market capitalization and reversed its year-to-date gains. Brazilian telecom regulator Anatel denied a report Friday that it was considering intervening with Oi, but that did nothing to pump up the stock.
“We have become concerned about Oi’s intention to accelerate its capex investment plan, despite cash burn of about 2 billion reais in 2Q19, as it depends on the successful conclusion of asset sales,” Bradesco BBI analysts led by Fred Mendes wrote in a report Thursday, reaffirming a neutral rating for the stock.
In mid-July, Oi outlined a turnaround plan in which it aims to sell 6.5 billion reais to 7.5 billion reais in noncore assets, including Unitel. “We believe the trigger for the stock will be the implementation of its strategic plan, particularly the materialization of the noncore assets sales, rather than quarterly results,” Itau BBA analysts led by Susana Salaru wrote in a report Thursday.

The system was being restored and passengers being processed, the agency said in a statement at 6:25 p.m. New York time. The failure was isolated to operations at airports, sparing other points of entry such as seaports or highway border crossings, according to the agency.
“CBP will continue to monitor the incident. There is no indication the disruption was malicious in nature at this time,” the agency said in a tweet.
Airports, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Los Angeles International, said in tweets late Friday afternoon that systems there were back in operation and passengers were being processed.
Seattle’s airport said the problem stemmed from the Federal Inspection Services’ computer system.
Customs officers at Dulles International Airport near Washington lost the ability to process passengers arriving from outside the U.S. at 3:18 p.m. local time, said Micah Lillard, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
Passengers were being held in the International Arrivals terminal and “the line is beginning to build,” Lillard said.
Videos posted on social media showed the waiting area to go through customs at Dulles packed with thousands of people.
New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International said in tweets that passengers were being processed manually during the outage, slowing entries.
At LAX, Customs brought in additional agents, mitigating the disruption, said Heath Montgomery, a spokesman for the city’s airport authority.

The company found itself  on the receiving end of a scathing report this week from Bernie Madoff whistle-blower Harry Markopolos, who accused GE of intentionally masking deeper financial problems. The shares fell the most since 2008 on Thursday. CEO Larry Culp said the report included false statements and amounted to “market manipulation.” Markopolos has an agreement with an unidentified hedge fund that will reward him with a share of the profits from bets that GE shares will decline, so clearly there’s more in this for him than just enlightening the investing public, and his report shouldn’t be taken as the final word. But it says something about the value of GE’s word that multiple company statements emphasizing Markopolos’s motivations did little to arrest the stock’s decline. Neither did audit committee chair and former Financial Accounting Standards Board chairman Leslie Seidman’s declaration to CNBC that she stands behind GE’s financial reporting. It was only after Culp bought $2 million of stock and some analysts  came to the company’s defense that the shares recovered substantially on Friday. 
Seidman told CNBC it sets a dangerous precedent when “somebody can just say things and then potentially benefit monetarily.” But that’s not really what happened here. While there’s a legitimate debate to be had about his arguments and liberal use of hyperbole, Markopolos isn’t hiding his financial interests, and he does have a track record of calling out fraud. If it was just a random person spouting off nonsense, investors wouldn’t have seen such a sustained, painful stock sell-off on Thursday. Barring any deliberately false accusations, the stock collapse on Markopolos’s report doesn’t really seem that different in practice from the 5.3% pop in GE’s shares in 2015 when Trian Fund Management disclosed a stake and released a white paper calling for the company to take on more debt to fund share buybacks. For Thursday’s slide to happen, Markopolos’s criticisms had to be ringing  at least a little bit true in the minds’ of investors frustrated by the perpetual opaqueness of GE’s financials.
His primary attacks on the company focus on the potential need to pour tens of billions of dollars more into the money pit that is GE’s long-term care insurance business. This  isn’t a new issue. Markopolos’s estimate that the business needs an immediate $18.5 billion cash injection and that the company will have to take a $10.5 billion charge in the next few years because of tougher accounting rules strike me as perhaps too doomsday-ish, and it’s not clear to me why regulators would require a lump-sum payment rather than allowing GE to spread it out over years. Given the many variables — including health care costs, interest rates, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s etc. — both GE and Markopolos can come up with a set of assumptions that suit their relative purposes. But the crux of it is that GE will most likely need to increase its reserves, perhaps as soon as this year’s loss-recognition testing. Seidman alluded to this possibility in her CNBC appearance: “Interest rates have declined. We have other changes in the assumptions and our experience that will be factored in and so we’ll probably see a change in that liability.” 
Whether GE committed fraud, as Markopolos contends and the company vehemently denies, will ultimately be decided by the SEC, which was already investigating GE’s accounting. But Culp  missed an opportunity when he started as CEO  to do away with GE’s myriad  earnings adjustments and tendency to  over-manage expectations. He hasn’t done that, and GE’s credibility problem persists. Rightly or wrongly, Markopolos took advantage of that. It means something that Culp is willing to put his money where his mouth is: his post-Markopolos report stock purchase comes after a $3 million purchase disclosed earlier this week. He’s also required to accumulate 10 times his $2.5 million annual salary over the first five years of his employment, per GE’s proxy, and hasn’t yet hit that threshold, according to the company. I found it interesting that Seidman told CNBC that if there was a “groundswell” of investors asking for a more detailed breakdown of expenses by division, “that’s something this management team would take seriously.” Well, the groundswell is there and it’s been there for years. Your move, GE.
THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMASMeanwhile, the trade war rages on. President Donald Trump announced this week that he was delaying 10% tariffs on some Chinese goods including phones and toys until Dec. 15. “We’re doing this for the Christmas season,” Trump said. “Just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customers.” Businesses hoping for a break in the relentless uncertainty, on the other hand, are  out of luck. We got fresh evidence of the trade war pain on Friday when tractor-maker Deere & Co. cut its 2019 net income guidance, lowered its outlook for North American agricultural equipment sales and slightly tempered projections for construction and forestry demand. The shares actually rose because the outlook, while hardly cheery, wasn’t as bad as feared. Deere CEO Samuel Allen vowed a “thorough assessment” of costs, which almost certainly implies job cuts. One way to read the Trump tariff delay is that he’s now signaled to China that he’s  not nearly as willing as that country has been to sustain market routs and economic pain. Perhaps that could help negotiators break the impasse. But the delay also  isn’t as much of an olive branch as it was initially made out to be. Tariffs on more than $110 billion of Chinese goods will still take effect on Sept. 1, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. This includes  about three-quarters of shoes, apparel and home textiles imported from China, says the American Apparel & Footwear Association. As Bloomberg News’s Shawn Donnan  points out, this alone is a significant escalation from where things stood even a month ago. The two sides are planning to talk, but China has vowed to retaliate to the tariffs that are going into effect and Trump said he’d been “very mild” thus far in the trade war. All this is to say, there’s no reason to believe this week’s partial tariff delay will do anything to arrest the slowdown in manufacturing.THE CHOICE OF A NEW GENERATIONUnited Parcel Service Inc. announced this week that it’s hiring PepsiCo Inc. executive Brian Newman to be its new CFO. Richard Peretz is set to step down from the CFO role after 38 years at the company that included a role planning its initial public offering in 1999. It’s another outside-of-the-box choice for CEO David Abney, who hired his chief transformation officer from Walmart Inc., his chief marketing officer from Xerox Corp. and his supply-chain solutions leader from logistics company DB Schenker. That’s a break from UPS’s traditional emphasis on internal talent and also another contrast with rival FedEx Corp., which is still run by founder Fred Smith and whose top executives have all been there for decades. I think UPS smartly realizes that outside perspective, particularly from the retail world, can help it better adapt to the boom in e-commerce. FedEx  would be wise to follow suit. Meanwhile, the U.S. Postal Service delivered fewer packages in the quarter ended June 30 than a year earlier. That’s the first drop in nine years, according to the Wall Street Journal. Amazon.com Inc. has been bolstering its own delivery network and FedEx is seeking to wrest back control of the 2 million daily packages it previously relied on the Postal Office to carry for the last legs. What was interesting to me is that Postmaster General Megan Brennan called out other logistics providers for “aggressively pricing” their products to win business, which hardly bodes well for margins.  DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCESyngenta AG, the Swiss pesticide maker that sold itself to China National Chemical Corp. in 2017 for more than $40 billion, is  reportedly preparing to return to public markets. The listing could happen as soon as mid-2020 and would likely be in Europe instead of Hong Kong or New York, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. The timing is contingent on what happens with a proposed megamerger between ChemChina and state-owned rival Sinochem Group that’s been in the works for years. It would also, I imagine, depend on the state of markets over the next 12 to 18 months given the rough environment for chemicals makers lately. BASF SE  warned in July the demand slump spurred by U.S.-China trade tensions could drive as much as a 30% cut to its 2019 operating profit compared with the year earlier. Circor International Inc. should combine its CEO and chairman jobs, according to Gamco Investors Inc., which is seeking to include a proposal along those lines in the company’s 2020 proxy statement. This is a bit odd as Gamco CEO and chief investment officer Mario Gabelli  has criticized the way Circor’s board handled a takeover approach from rival Crane Co. While common at large companies, a dual-role CEO and chairman isn’t exactly considered the gold standard of corporate governance. Gamco also says it’s been in contact with individuals willing to serve on Circor’s board and it’s evaluating submitting nominees at the company’s next annual meeting. Recall that Crane saw impressive support from shareholders for its hostile tender offer but ultimately let its bid expire and walked away. The company has said it has no intention of pursuing a proxy fight at Circor.AMS AG is the counterbidder that just won’t die. The maker of components for Apple Inc.’s iPhone  launched a 3.7 billion euro ($4.1 billion) bid for Osram Licht AG, beating out the 3.4 billion euro offer that the company had previously agreed to accept from Bain Capital and Carlyle Group. The strategic merits of piling on debt to acquire a lighting maker mired in a sales slump with few obvious near-term fixes  remain elusive for AMS investors, who have aggressively sold the stock this week. But that’s of little concern to Osram investors who are happy to pocket a little extra premium. The question is how badly the private equity firms want this business and whether they’re willing to fight for it. The math was already a bit strained.United Technologies Corp. may still face pushback to its merger with Raytheon Co. even after critic Bill Ackman sold out of the stock. A poll conducted by Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned found that 47% of respondents don’t think the combination makes strategic and financial sense. Interestingly, 50% said they thought United Technologies was getting the better end of the deal, indicating it may actually be Raytheon holders that put up the bigger roadblock. The companies also got a second request from the Department of Justice for more information on the merger. The stocks actually dipped a bit on the news, but it would be extremely surprising if a deal of this magnitude involving two big defense contractors didn’t get a second request.BONUS READING FAA Poised to Reject New Simulator Training Before 737 Max FliesTesla Order Breakdown Signals Service Risk in BMW’s Backyard U.S. Love Affair With Flying Is Growing Faster Than the Economy In Trump’s America, Why Code When You Can Dig?: Liam Denning Aston Martin Thought It Had Won the Lottery: Chris Bryant A Quiet Revolution at a Storied British Yacht Builder

I think UPS smartly realizes that outside perspective, particularly from the retail world, can help it better adapt to the boom in e-commerce. FedEx  would be wise to follow suit. Meanwhile, the U.S. Postal Service delivered fewer packages in the quarter ended June 30 than a year earlier. That’s the first drop in nine years, according to the Wall Street Journal. Amazon.com Inc. has been bolstering its own delivery network and FedEx is seeking to wrest back control of the 2 million daily packages it previously relied on the Postal Office to carry for the last legs. What was interesting to me is that Postmaster General Megan Brennan called out other logistics providers for “aggressively pricing” their products to win business, which hardly bodes well for margins.  DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCESyngenta AG, the Swiss pesticide maker that sold itself to China National Chemical Corp. in 2017 for more than $40 billion, is  reportedly preparing to return to public markets. The listing could happen as soon as mid-2020 and would likely be in Europe instead of Hong Kong or New York, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. The timing is contingent on what happens with a proposed megamerger between ChemChina and state-owned rival Sinochem Group that’s been in the works for years. It would also, I imagine, depend on the state of markets over the next 12 to 18 months given the rough environment for chemicals makers lately. BASF SE  warned in July the demand slump spurred by U.S.-China trade tensions could drive as much as a 30% cut to its 2019 operating profit compared with the year earlier. Circor International Inc. should combine its CEO and chairman jobs, according to Gamco Investors Inc., which is seeking to include a proposal along those lines in the company’s 2020 proxy statement. This is a bit odd as Gamco CEO and chief investment officer Mario Gabelli  has criticized the way Circor’s board handled a takeover approach from rival Crane Co. While common at large companies, a dual-role CEO and chairman isn’t exactly considered the gold standard of corporate governance. Gamco also says it’s been in contact with individuals willing to serve on Circor’s board and it’s evaluating submitting nominees at the company’s next annual meeting. Recall that Crane saw impressive support from shareholders for its hostile tender offer but ultimately let its bid expire and walked away. The company has said it has no intention of pursuing a proxy fight at Circor.AMS AG is the counterbidder that just won’t die. The maker of components for Apple Inc.’s iPhone  launched a 3.7 billion euro ($4.1 billion) bid for Osram Licht AG, beating out the 3.4 billion euro offer that the company had previously agreed to accept from Bain Capital and Carlyle Group. The strategic merits of piling on debt to acquire a lighting maker mired in a sales slump with few obvious near-term fixes  remain elusive for AMS investors, who have aggressively sold the stock this week. But that’s of little concern to Osram investors who are happy to pocket a little extra premium. The question is how badly the private equity firms want this business and whether they’re willing to fight for it. The math was already a bit strained.United Technologies Corp. may still face pushback to its merger with Raytheon Co. even after critic Bill Ackman sold out of the stock. A poll conducted by Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned found that 47% of respondents don’t think the combination makes strategic and financial sense. Interestingly, 50% said they thought United Technologies was getting the better end of the deal, indicating it may actually be Raytheon holders that put up the bigger roadblock. The companies also got a second request from the Department of Justice for more information on the merger. The stocks actually dipped a bit on the news, but it would be extremely surprising if a deal of this magnitude involving two big defense contractors didn’t get a second request.BONUS READING FAA Poised to Reject New Simulator Training Before 737 Max FliesTesla Order Breakdown Signals Service Risk in BMW’s Backyard U.S. Love Affair With Flying Is Growing Faster Than the Economy In Trump’s America, Why Code When You Can Dig?: Liam Denning Aston Martin Thought It Had Won the Lottery: Chris Bryant A Quiet Revolution at a Storied British Yacht Builder

There are questions Jeffrey Epstein will never answer now. 
But a lifetime ago—long before his dark journey ended in an apparent suicide in a Manhattan jail cell—Epstein settled into a sling-back chair on his private Caribbean island and began talking.
Over the course of more than five hours, in an interview with journalist David Bank, Epstein held forth on subjects from the dangers of having too much money to the beauty of mathematics, the importance of prenuptial agreements to the exquisite convenience of owning private jets.
That 2003 interview, captured in a previously unpublished cache of recordings, provides a rare glimpse of the enigmatic figure in his own words.
Epstein drew the rich and powerful into his orbit over three decades, even after he registered as a sex offender in 2009. His opulent retreat of Little St. James, fringed by high palms, only added to his mystique.
But why speak here, in a gazebo steps from the crystal-blue sea, rather than up in the grand main house?
“Too many girls,” Epstein said. And with that, the tape began to roll.
I realize what I am. I’m very comfortable in my own skin. I’m not a helicopter pilot. What I’m really free to do is I feel free to follow my own personality. As we discussed yesterday, I can’t be totally wacko in what I do. It affects lots of other people who will get angry with what I do because then it affects me again. But on my own island or on my own ranch, I can think the thoughts I want to think. I can do the work I want to do and I’m free to explore as I see fit.
The recordings were made by Bank, now head of the digital media company ImpactAlpha and then a Wall Street Journal reporter whose beat was philanthropy. Epstein was soon to donate $6.5 million to Harvard University to support research into evolutionary dynamics, the largest known contribution he made over the years as he tried to cultivate a reputation as a moneyed patron. The Journal didn’t publish a story based on the interview on Little St. James.
After Epstein’s arrest on July 6, Bank dug out the tapes and listened to them. The financier was, Bank recalled, friendly and gracious, eager to pontificate about many things but cagey about exactly what he did in his role as financial adviser to Leslie Wexner, the billionaire he met in Palm Beach in the 1980s and who opened doors for him in business and finance and beyond.Epstein wouldn’t name any of his other clients, nor say how many there were. “Less than 10. More than four.”
He did, though, touch a bit on the control he had over the finances of the Victoria’s Secret mogul. “I don’t tell him what sweaters to buy, he doesn’t tell me when to buy or sell stock.”
 People would always call me and say, could you come look at my problems? Could you come see my situation and tell me what you think. And I started J. Epstein & Co. I think in 1982 or 1983. And I said I would only take you if you had a billion dollars or more.
Born in 1953 in Brooklyn — on the tapes he still has the accent — Epstein went to what he called “rough schools” and took college courses but never earned a degree. The Dalton School, an elite institution on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, hired him as a teacher anyway.
“It attracted me because I thought it would be a different class of students I hadn’t come across before,” he said. For him, “this was going to be the flip side” to his early years on blue-collar Coney Island.
The parents of the kids in his math and physics classes were not only well-to-do but, more importantly, connected, people like, as he recalled, the actor Joel Grey and venture capitalist Fred Adler. He paid attention.
I saw lots of people doing lots of hard work and hard work didn’t translate into success either. It wasn’t what you knew or how hard you worked. In fact, the people who were doing construction on Telegraph Avenue at that time were, I remember seeing some people, you know, coming in at seven o’clock in the morning and spending 12 hours working and look they still were neither happy or successful. So it’s not about what you know. And what I learned from Dalton later, lots of it in fact turns out to, not necessarily who you knew, but who you came in contact with.
Jeff Epstein’s career as a fixer, for lack of a better description, was about to be launched. Through a Dalton School parent, he met Bear Stearns Cos.’ Alan “Ace” Greenberg. Greenberg summoned the young man to his office, barked out a few questions and hired him on the spot.
I started at Bear Stearns in 1976. Bear Stearns never had any training program. There was no course to begin. Alan Greenberg said he wanted me to learn each area of the business. So he thought the best place for me to start would be on the floor of the American Stock Exchange and then later move up to the trading desk and learn all the different areas of the firm including the margin department. He was amazing.
Epstein said it was his ability to comprehend the pricing of options — then the cutting edge of finance — that allowed him to rise swiftly to limited partner. He applied what he called a scientific approach to his trades. Success was heady.
The way I saw it was physics, which was in fact based on a fixed number of rules and you did experiments in physics that couldn’t violate those rules and if your experiment worked you hit the target. Finance seemed to be a different metaphor for the same processes but when you hit your target, you were able to fly first class to Paris.
What the interview on Little St. James didn’t reveal was the answer to the most intriguing question: How exactly did Epstein get so rich? At the time of his arrest on federal charges that he molested and exploited dozens of teenage girls, he was worth more than $500 million, according to a financial disclosure his lawyers filed in an unsuccessful request for bail.
Making money is my priority for how I think about things. Money itself and how  people make money and how money is made in different ways. So takeovers were a way to make money. Commodity trading, was a way to make money. To me the new one is currencies.
At Dalton, he said, he earned less than $20,000 a year. He made a “comfortable living,” during his five years at Bear Stearns. He set up J Epstein & Co. in New York in the early 1980s, later changing the name to Financial Trust Co. and moving its headquarters to the U.S. Virgin Islands. He bought Little St. James for $7.95 million in 1998 and nearby Great St. James in 2016 for $22.5 million. Just the property taxes on his homes in New York, New Mexico and Florida came to more than $600,000 last year.
As a money manager, Epstein earned fees for investment advice, tax services and estate planning. He bragged about how his decision to charge flat fees freed him from the pressure of incessant trading and differentiated him from stock brokers in an era when trading was commission based. 
He had some breaks along the way, when, for instance, he advised clients to exit the market before 1987’s Black Monday crash. “It was more luck than anything,” Epstein said—he’d given the advice because he was going on vacation around that time and didn’t want to be disturbed. He also helped clients with more esoteric matters, advising them about purchasing private islands and how best to decorate private jets. “I might get involved with how to operate a plane, how to charter the plane or the boat or do the interiors, the engines, the propulsion systems.”
The perks of wealth were important to him — “Having personal staff is the first great luxury,” he said — but wealth was also a worry, a weight. He talked about the very rich being easy targets for fraudsters, about the care he took when he started making philanthropic donations and the risk of blackmail. 
“My concern is that people can make spurious allegations all the time,” he said. “The idea is if nothing else he’ll buy me off. I’ll attack his reputation and he’ll buy me off.”
One of the biggest issues is if you have too much money most likely you won’t miss it if some is taken from you. That’s very important, which is in fact security concerns—and this is the reason I’ve always been private and wisely so—is as you become known as a philanthropist or in giving away money then you become the perfect victim of frauds and identity theft.
He returned often to the cheating-the-rich theme, which is a curiosity considering Wexner’s recent accusation that Epstein swindled him and his family out of “vast sums of money” during their long association.
What about the clues in the tapes as to what made Epstein tick? They aren’t easy to suss out; he touched on so many topics, often seemingly randomly. He did frequently return to his love of music — he said he played the piano since he was 5 — mathematics and the sciences, expounding for minutes on end about the workings of the brain and evolutionary dynamics.
Epstein: I was always very good at mathematics.Reporter: What made you interested in it?Epstein: It was solving puzzles. It’s a strange feeling when you get the right answer to a puzzle. That leads to a later discussion about why people are so excited about puzzle solving and why is the brain itself both a predictor of things and an inherent puzzle solver. In fact, I hate to sort of jump again to more brain things but the idea of people receive pleasure when they get the right answer to a puzzle and the question is when you say pleasure, does that mean there’s a bit of dopamine released in the brain? What are the real mechanics? What’s going on in someone’s head when they have what Duchamp referred to as the Aha! moment.
His financial strategy included one iron-clad rule: He’d sell if any investment ever lost 10%. “If I lose $10 million of a $100 million I’m out. Under no circumstances am I going to lose more than 10% of my investments,” he said. “I always want to have enough money to stay in the game.”
There was a book I read when I first started on Wall Street which was called “Sell is a Four Letter Word,” which meant that people get attached to things. They refuse to sell, or they refuse to resign, and they make up lots of reasons why that they’re sticking around. Whether it be in relationships with other people, or with stocks. People have stocks that go down and they tell themselves I know I should have sold then, but I can’t sell now.
The financial institutions that dealt with Epstein, including Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., have worked to distance themselves from his taint ever since his arrest on the federal charges. But more than 15 years ago, Epstein was — in his telling — a highly valued client for JPMorgan.
JPMorgan is probably the best private bankers in the world. The head of private banking you should talk to—Jes Staley. They know they can call up and ask me, you know, there’s an opportunity here and might take a very large sum of money, $100 million or more, whatever the number may be. And I can give them an answer by the end of the telephone call.
By 2006 — the year he was first arrested, in Palm Beach — Epstein had a 10,000-acre spread he called Zorro Ranch in New Mexico, a waterside home in Palm Beach, a luxury apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris, the 70-acre island in the Caribbean and a Manhattan mansion across the street from the Frick Collection museum.
“Is it appropriate to have your own personal island and a 727 with its own bedroom?” Epstein said. “Why not?”

Bloomberg
Representative Steve King has given Democratic presidential candidates more fodder to bash him and direct support to his Democratic challenger.
On Wednesday, King, an Iowa Republican who has been stripped of his committee assignments for his history of offensive comments, expressed his opposition to exceptions for rape and incest in anti-abortion legislation by saying that humanity might not exist if rape and incest did not occur, according to the Des Moines Register.
Steve King
Many of the Democrats running for president, including Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, immediately said that King should resign, and some posted a link to donate to J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who is challenging King again after narrowly losing to him in 2018.
Many Democrats had previously called for King to resign earlier this year after comments he made to The New York Times questioning why the term white supremacy was offensive.
Beto O’Rourke says he’ll return to the presidential campaign trail after taking more than a week off in the aftermath of the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso.O’Rourke’s campaign announced he’ll give the “first major address” of his flagging presidential effort Thursday in El Paso, outlining the path forward for his candidacy.
Beto O’Rourke
Earlier this month, a gunman killed 22 people and injured 24 at a Walmart in El Paso. Just before the shooting, the suspect posted a manifesto online in which he denounced immigration and wrote that “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
O’Rourke entered the presidential contest with sky-high expectations after a narrow loss to Ted Cruz in a 2018 Senate race. However, O’Rourke has failed to gain much traction in the race, and many Democrats have pushed him to drop out of the race and run for the Senate against John Cornyn in 2020.
The Trump campaign is putting an early focus on New Hampshire, site of the nation’s first presidential primary election, setting up campaign staff even though the president is virtually unopposed.A rally by President Donald Trump on Thursday comes as Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren campaign in the state this week.
His campaign announced Wednesday that the Republican National Committee and campaign had put in place a political director, state director, and three Trump campaign chairs.
The stated goal of the team is “up and down ballot” victories in 2020, according to Trump Campaign manager Brad Parscale in the announcement, where he also sought to cast the election as a contest between “socialist government takeover” and Trump. Sanders calls himself a socialist, and Warren’s policies are left of Democratic Party norms.

Michael Bennet has a different strategy for pitching his case to be president: If elected, you just might not see him for weeks at a time.“Watching Donald Trump’s presidency is like watching one of those car accidents you can’t take you eyes away from,” the U.S. senator from Colorado told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Wednesday.
Michael Bennet
The Democratic candidate -- who has not yet made the cut off for the next debates -- said Trump was “wasting everybody’s time” with his “endless reality TV show.” Bennet said Trump has “exhausted all of us and I think its just time to move on.”
Bennet wrote on Twitter last week that if elected president, “I promise you won’t have to think about me for 2 weeks at a time. I’ll do my job watching out for North Korea and ending this trade war. So you can go raise your kids and live your lives.” -- Terrence Dopp
* President Donald Trump holds a “Keep America Great” rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Thursday.* The Democratic National Committee holds its meeting Aug. 22-24 in San Francisco. All Democratic presidential candidates are expected to speak.* The next round of Democratic presidential debates is Sept. 12-13 in Houston. So far, nine candidates have qualified to participate.

143,,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-13/koch-s-massive-tech-bet-do-it-or-we-ll-end-up-in-the-dumpster,"August 13, 2019, 7:00 AM EDT",Koch’s Massive Tech Bet: ‘Do It or We’ll End Up in the Dumpster’,"Chase Koch, front, and his father, Charles Koch, chief executive officer of Koch Industries, on June 29, 2019.
A $139 billion industrial behemoth looks toward the future.
It’s not quite what you’d expect from a Koch. Certainly not before the gray-haired Rotary Club in Wichita, Kansas.
But there was Chase Koch, scion of one of America’s mightiest private industrial dynasties—a family revered by the political right, reviled by the left and feared by just about everyone—joking about his knock-about years down in Texas.
It was back in the early 2000s, Chase said, after he graduated with a marketing degree from the proudly anti-Ivy League Texas A&M (His father, Charles, and uncle, David, studied engineering at MIT, as did his grandfather, Fred). Reluctant to tap the Koch network for a job, he was hunting for work, banging out Led Zeppelin covers with his band and, as he put it, “screwing around in Austin.”
Times change—and, with time, the Kochs do, too. Chase, 42, now sits on the board of Koch Industries and is president of Koch Disruptive Technologies, the conglomerate’s venture-capital arm. He’s at the sharp edge of efforts to prepare for a knowledge-based future where cheap computers, data and artificial intelligence might threaten the firm’s dominance.
He’s also positioned to control one of the world’s most powerful closely held companies, and represents the future of the conservative political network that has put the Kochs among the country’s most influential families.
See the list: The Richest Families in the World
Few people are aware of just how big Koch is, or the industries it inhabits. Much as Warren Buffett grew Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from its textile-mill roots, Koch keeps about 90% of its profit and pumps the money back into its businesses or buys new ones. It’s now a sprawling network of subsidiaries reporting back to headquarters in Wichita. They include forestry products (Georgia Pacific), fertilizer (Koch Ag & Energy Solutions), fabrics (Invista), commodities trading (Koch Supply & Trading) and ranching (Matador Cattle).
The brothers invested well. The $21 million company that Charles joined in 1961 is now worth about $139 billion, a 662,000% return, or roughly 16% annually over almost six decades. Charles and David own about 84% of the company (Elaine Marshall owns most of the rest, gaining control of the stake after the 2006 death of her husband, E. Pierce Marshall).

Historically, these investments were in industrial assets—refineries, chemical plants, sawmills.
But over the past few years, they’ve been more futuristic, especially in the venture-capital arm led by Chase Koch. The conglomerate has invested billions of dollars in software, network technology, big data, AI, medical technology and 3D printing.
“It’s actually really smart for them to do this,” said Hans Swildens, chief executive officer of Industry Ventures, which manages more than $3.4 billion of institutional capital. “If you owned a large number of industrial businesses, and you were looking at all the new technologies that were coming out and how they would affect your business, the best thing that you can do is embrace those.”
Jim Hannan, an executive vice president who oversees about half of Koch’s subsidiaries, said tech “has led to a much more common set of issues and opportunities across all our businesses.”
At the same time, big industrials are struggling to grow.
“We are rapidly moving to a digital economy,” said Nick Heymann of William Blair & Co. “Most of the net worth in the last 20 years in this country has been created outside tangible manufacturing businesses.”
For Charles Koch, it was a question of survival. At a 2017 leadership meeting, he pushed his managers to embrace technology and prepare for a knowledge-based future. His message: “Do it or we’ll end up in the Dumpster.”
Falling technology costs are generating new threats to established industries.
There’s “a level of competition that these players did not face,” said Sanjay Agarwal of Boston-based venture-capital fund F-Prime Capital. “Now you can have startups out of a garage building an autonomous vehicle. That was just not possible earlier.”
Cheap computing power and data will fundamentally change every industry, said Koch Chief Financial Officer Steve Feilmeier. The firm said it has invested more than $17 billion in technology companies since 2013, with big bets in cloud computing and enterprise data analytics. Investments have included acquisitions as well as strategic stakes.

If it’s going to be disrupted by a new technology, Koch wants to be doing the disrupting and “investing in it in a way where we better understand it,” Feilmeier said.
The focus on tech isn’t as big a shift as it appears, said Christopher Leonard, author of “Kochland,” a just-released book about the dynasty.
“If you go back to the 1970s, this company was a knowledge company,” he said. “Yes, they owned oil refineries, but they also filled the basement with IBM computers to study the crude-oil market, the gasoline market, to figure out how to run the refineries at the most optimum level.”
Data analytics have been embedded in the Koch DNA for decades, Leonard said. “I’m not at all surprised that they’re making bigger moves into that space. It builds on their expertise.”
Trying to reposition a huge industrial conglomerate around digital technology doesn’t always have a happy ending.
General Electric Co. “made this big effort and got over its ski tips to make itself the platform for industrial digital analytics, and it got way more expensive more quickly” than former CEO Jeff Immelt anticipated, said William Blair’s Heymann.
Byron Trott, the founder of merchant bank BDT Capital Partners, who has worked with Koch for more than 25 years and advised on several acquisitions, doesn’t see it running into the same problems. GE faced short-term pressures that come with being publicly traded, he said, while “Koch is doing this because they are really, really good at thinking long term.”
Chase Koch’s group has made some of the more ambitious bets outside of Koch’s traditional areas of expertise, like investing in InSightec Ltd., a manufacturer of ultrasound-based surgical tools that can eliminate the need for incisions. He’s the only member of the family from the next generation that works at the company. His sister Elizabeth Koch runs a publishing house, Catapult Books, and David’s children are much younger.
Still, Chase took a somewhat unconventional path.
After graduating from Texas A&M, he spent several years in Austin playing in a band covering Led Zeppelin, Phish and the Grateful Dead, and trying to find his way in the city’s tech startup scene. While he previously held summer jobs at Koch, including his first at a cattle ranch at age 15, he spent the years after graduation avoiding his father’s shadow.
“I was too proud to tap into the Koch network,” he told the Wichita Rotarians.
Although he was schooled in his family’s politics from a young age—he recalls Saturdays as a 6-year-old listening to books on tape by Milton Friedman—it’s unclear whether he shares the political philosophy of his father and uncle, who ran for vice president as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1980.
“I start with the idea that to learn and grow, you’ve got to be open to other people’s ideas,” Chase Koch told Politico last year. Politics, while important, is “not at all what I’m passionate about.”
That raises questions about what will become of the Koch political network, which gives his father outsize influence in the U.S. “There is no comparison for any CEO in corporate America in terms of political influence when compared to Charles Koch,” Leonard said.
The Kochs sponsor candidates, think tanks, advocacy groups and academic groups pushing a conservative, free-market agenda.
Recently, there have been disagreements with the Republican Party under President Donald Trump on issues such as free trade and immigration. Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs’ primary political advocacy group, is shifting focus toward “finding nonpartisan solutions,” according to a June memo, and it’s prepared to support candidates who get things done regardless of party.
In July, the Kochs partnered with liberal investor and philanthropist George Soros to found the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a think tank dedicated to promoting peaceful U.S. foreign policy.
Leonard said he isn’t convinced the moves constitute a real change to the Kochs’ political goals.
“It feels like an adaptable reaction to the moment,” he said, “even as Koch keeps its eye on the long-term strategy of doing one thing, which is constraining the reach of the federal government, dismantling the administrative state and pushing back the reach of government as far as possible.”
The political network is “exactly like the corporation,” he said. “It’s run with a long-term view. It has strategic patience.”
When Chase returned to Wichita to rejoin Koch Industries after his years in Austin, he began a rotation of high-level jobs, including stints in mergers and acquisitions, tax structuring, agronomics and trading. It was designed as an MBA-like experience to familiarize him with various parts of the operation.
Koch Industries won’t detail its succession plan beyond saying that one is in place, and that roles are filled by those most qualified.
If Chase eventually succeeds his father in running the firm and the political network, he’ll become one of the country’s most influential people.

Bullion has surged 18% over three months to the highest in six years. While that’s good news for mining companies, it’s spurring a burst of illegal prospecting that has helped fuel drug trafficking and organized crime within some of the world’s top gold-producing regions.
Flecks of gold remain in a pan at an illegal mine near the city of Quibdo, Colombia.
In the Yanomami indigenous lands along Brazil’s border with Venezuela, the number of illegal miners has grown ten-fold since December to 20,000, according to Instituto Socioambiental, which monitors native groups. The miners are emboldened by President Jair Bolsonaro’s rhetoric on the area’s mineral wealth, and enabled by authorities that have lowered their guard. But the risk wouldn’t be as attractive without the price surge.
When prices rise, “it’s not just gold mining that increases,” said Livia Wagner, who authored a 2016 report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. “It’s demand for sex workers -- women and young girls -- uncontrolled use of mercury, the killing of indigenous people, and the arrival of well-organized crime cartels.”
People pan illegally for gold at a site near the city of Quibdo, Colombia.
In general, miners are considered illegal when they fail to get proper permits, work in environmentally protected areas, use heavy machinery without oversight, fail to pay taxes or employ workers without labor contracts.
A third of the gold exported from Latin America in 2013 was mined illegally, Wagner’s report found. The value at the time: Around $6.9 billion. Meanwhile, the cost to local communities is what really stands out, starting with the environment.
Mercury is mixed with gold to help remove the natural impurities scooped up along with the precious metal by small mining operations. The two elements naturally form an amalgam that’s heated up. When the mercury dissolves, gold that’s now largely unadulterated is left behind.
But the heating process releases noxious fumes into the air, and leftover mercury too often works its way into the soil and local waterways.
Small gold operations dump more than 30 tons of mercury in rivers and lakes in the Amazon region every year, according to a study by the Carnegie Amazon Mercury Project quoted in Wagner’s report. Exposure can cause cancer, neurological damage and, potentially, shock and death.

""The animals are dying, the fish are dying, the river is polluted by mercury, and also the mercury is damaging the Yanomami people’s health, causing stomach pains and diarrhea,"" said Dario Kopenawa Yanomami, vice-president of the Hutukara association that represents the indigenous group. “That’s happening today.”
There’s also been a big increase in malaria in the region, according to Kopenawa. “We are suffering,"" he said. ""We’re suffering from threats, suffering from danger, suffering in health. It’s a lot.”
The indiscriminate use of mercury by gold miners around Puerto Maldonado in Peru, the world’s sixth largest gold producer, has wrecked the Amazon’s lush vegetation.
Through the years, miners have devastated an area of the Peruvian Amazon that’s almost five times the size of Manhattan. Meanwhile, Peru’s government has seen limited success containing illegal mining, despite raids by armed forces. More than 90% of the gold coming out of there is mined illegally, but the government has so far formalized just 5,000 miners out of the 300,000 operating in the country, according to estimates by Lima-based consultancy Macroconsult.
Illegal mines in La Pampa, Madre de Dios, Peru, on May 17.
Overall, there’s probably around 2,300 illegal mining sites in and around the ecologically-sensitive Amazon rainforest, with most located in Venezuela, according to the Amazonia Saqueada dabatase that includes data compiled by a wide association of non-governmental groups.
Trouble with illegal miners is not exclusive to Latin America, though.
In South Africa, for instance, illegal miners are a law unto themselves. The criminal syndicates are called “zama zamas,” a native Zulu name for “take a chance.” They are armed, and often dig their way into underground shafts where they illegally mine for days or even months at a time, according to James Wellsted, spokesman for Sibanye Gold Ltd.
Industry body Minerals Council South Africa estimates 14,000 people are involved in these syndicates, with trade in illegally mined precious metals estimated to be around 7 billion rand ($470 million) annually.
“Confronting them underground could lead to fatalities,” Wellsted said by telephone. “There is also a broader environmental and social impact. They are a source of terror in some of the communities around the mines.”
These were familiar scenes years ago in Puerto Maldonado, the capital of Peru’s Madre de Dios region, said Fred Inti, a businessman and the vice-president of the city’s Chamber of Commerce. The government’s attempt to crack down on illegal mining hasn’t stopped desperate people from flooding in.
""They have moved away from traditional mining areas and deep into the Amazon,"" Inti said. They work in places where the law can’t reach them and they don’t care if these are protected areas.""
As long as there are gold buyers from Miami to Moscow, he said, ""illegal gold mining will keep thriving.""

Once again, global tremors toppled stocks.

Hey big spender: The U.S. budget deficit has already exceeded all of last year's, with the gap growing to $866.8 billion in the first 10 months of the fiscal year, up 27% from a year earlier, and more than last fiscal year's shortfall of $779 billion. Republican tax cuts, increased spending and an aging population have contributed to the fiscal strains.

The NCAA doesn't employ or have to pay athletes, a federal appeals court has ruled. The decision comes as the NCAA, its conferences and its schools are under an unprecedented amount of pressure to overhaul their practices. Lamar Dawson, a former linebacker for the University of Southern California, ""cannot demonstrate that the NCAA or the PAC-12 had the power to fire or hire him,"" Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote in the Ninth Circuit opinion. 
The 1930s are back. The current U.S.-China trade conflict, now a currency war, has an eerie resemblance to a back-and-forth volley of devaluations and retaliatory tariffs that ripped apart the global economy almost a century ago, Stephen Mihm writes for Bloomberg Opinion. President Franklin D. Roosevelt saw the light in 1934 and changed direction back toward international currency stability and free trade. But Trump is going to stay the course. ""And that, sadly, means that we're in for a rocky ride.""
When huge lines of climbers have to wait to scale Mount Everest, it's clear that the world's tourists are crowding each other out of a good time, writes Bloomberg Opinion's Noah Smith. The problem can be ameliorated by spreading visitors around to less crowded destinations, as Japan has done, or cutting back on self-promotion. But eventually there will be no choice but to start charging tourists a fee.

Ketchup scientists have been busy. Kraft Heinz now has at least 20 varieties of the stuff: the jalapeño flavor, the sriracha, no-salt, sugar-free.... Still, it's not enough. Heinz controls 70% of the ketchup market, but is struggling to increase sales and profit.

Russia's Defense Ministry initially reported that just two died in the accident which involved testing of a liquid-fueled missile engine, and didn't mention the nuclear part. The fact a nuclear incident happened is less important than the government's failure to tell the whole truth, Leonid Bershidsky writes for Bloomberg Opinion.

Offering up solutions is more complicated.
Speculation bubbled up again this week about whether the parcel-delivery company might draw the attention of a change-seeking shareholder. FedEx shares are  down by a third over the past year  as the company battles U.S.-China trade  tensions, the  challenges of integrating  its TNT Express acquisition and the seemingly never-ending cost of adapting to  a reality where Amazon.com Inc. is both the company’s greatest gift and its biggest headache. FedEx this week said it would  cease U.S. ground deliveries of Amazon shipments, after earlier letting a U.S. air-delivery contract with the e-commerce giant lapse. Maybe Amazon was giving FedEx the least profitable parts of its shipping volume and saving the higher-density deliveries for its own burgeoning network of vans and fulfillment centers, so the math no longer worked. But FedEx says Amazon accounted for only about 1.3% of its sales last year, making the move mostly a symbolic protest. Some have wondered whether FedEx is trying to  bolster its relationship with Walmart Inc., although I’m unconvinced that retailers will shift business away from United Parcel Service Inc. en masse just because that carrier still works with Amazon. I tend to think FedEx realized Amazon was using its services as a base upon which to build a competing logistics platform and decided to break with Amazon before Amazon breaks up with it. 
Against this backdrop, FedEx added a bizarre line to its annual filing released last month, saying shareholder activism “could divert the attention of management and our board of directors from our business, hinder execution of our business strategy, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future and cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.” I’m sorry, but if you are the type of company that includes change-seeking investors on a list of business risks that also features widespread outbreak of disease and government under-investment in infrastructure, then you are exactly the type of company that needs an activist. The filing language was the perfect cap to FedEx CEO and founder Fred Smith’s  defensive performance on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in June. Activist investors’ questions about weak cash flow and the long-term viability of the Express air-delivery unit aren’t as easily rebuffed as those of sell-side analysts. Bill Ackman reportedly decided it wasn’t worth fighting United Technologies Corp. on its takeover of Raytheon Co. (a wise move as his argument against the transaction  wasn’t particularly convincing) and sold his stake in the company instead. His firm said this week it’s working on a new investment that amounts to 12% of the net asset value at publicly traded affiliate Pershing Square Holdings Ltd., with Dealreporter speculating that company could be FedEx.

Ackman has had his fair share of misses, but he’s generally done better with more industrial-oriented investments (Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.) versus retailers (Target Corp., J.C. Penney Co.) and drug companies (Valeant Pharmaceuticals). So a FedEx investment would make some sense. As far as what he or another activist investor could push for, here’s the puzzling thing: UPS and FedEx are doing much of the same things as far as cutting costs and using automation to boost efficiency, and yet there are early signs that UPS is getting returns on those investments, while FedEx plods along more slowly. The divergence in the companies’ relationship with Amazon is curious: While FedEx specifically lists Amazon as a source of potential competition in its filings, UPS doesn’t. As FedEx dials back its relationship with the e-commerce giant, UPS will likely be a beneficiary, having already notched a 30% boost in domestic next-day air shipments in the second quarter that may in part reflect market share gains. One good quarter from UPS hardly makes a trend, and the company’s greater dependence on Amazon for revenue makes it harder to cut ties. But it’s worth asking whether UPS management has figured something out that FedEx hasn’t. Analysts have also asked whether FedEx still needs as many retail stores as it builds out a network of drop-off centers at Walmart and Dollar General Corp. Others have asked whether the scale of the Express unit should be rethought or if the business could be more integrated into the ground operations.  The problem is that none of these are quick fixes. 
ENDING ON EMERSONThe industrial earnings season ended on a somber note, with Emerson Electric Co. CEO Dave Farr offering some of the most ominous commentary yet on the slowdown in key markets such as automotives, electronics and upstream oil and gas. Farr says customers are being cautious and that the pace of investment will likely remain relatively weak ""well into 2020,"" given the uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election in November of that year. The growth outlook could improve if there's a trade deal with China in early 2020, but Farr's not banking on that with regard to the company's longer-term financial targets. Given the events of the past week – China allowed the yuan to weaken beyond the key benchmark of 7 per dollar for the first time in more than a decade and has reportedly asked state-owned enterprises to halt U.S. agricultural purchases; the White House responded by delaying a decision on providing licenses to American companies looking to do business with Huawei Technologies Co. – Farr’s conservatism looks warranted. He insisted the cycle of industrial sales growth hasn’t ended and is merely in “pause mode.” But November 2020 is more than a year away, and that’s an awfully long pause that starts to look like something more damaging. While it hasn’t seen any cancellations, Emerson said $350 million of projects planned for 2019 had been pushed to next year, while $450 million of 2020 projects had been delayed to 2021. The balance of order commitments that haven’t yet been booked has swelled to more than $1 billion, compared with about $800 million in February. I will point out that for all Farr’s attempts to paint this as merely a pause in activity, Emerson seems to be much more realistic with its guidance and stepped-up restructuring efforts than 3M Co., which  is still clinging to a 2019 organic sales outlook that appears to depend on stabilization in China and automotive markets in the second half of the year. On the bright side for industrial companies, costs for materials are coming down, easing some of the margin pinch from tariffs.

DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEWesco Aircraft Holdings Inc. agreed to sell itself to an affiliate of private equity firm Platinum Equity for about $1.9 billion. Platinum will merge Wesco’s aerospace and defense parts distribution business with a supply-chain management company it already owns called Pattonair. The $11.05-a-share offer is about a 14% premium to where Wesco was trading before Reuters reported in May that the company was exploring a sale. Suntrust analyst Michael Ciarmoli had speculated at the time that Wesco could fetch as much as $17 a share  if suitors were willing to compensate shareholders for the potential benefits of the company’s plan to cut costs and reduce its debt load. It appears Platinum Equity wanted to keep those benefits for itself; the purchase price implies a discount to what Boeing Co.  paid for rival aerospace distributor KLX Inc. last year. But Wesco’s three largest shareholders (including former private equity owner Carlyle Group, which retains a 23% stake) have agreed to back the deal, so perhaps they know something we don’t.  Roper Technologies Inc. agreed to buy iPipeline, a maker of software for the life insurance and financial services industries, for $1.625 billion. The deal – the second biggest in a long line of acquisitions by the company – fits the mold of a classic Roper takeover:  a niche software business where the company can become part of an oligopoly and command high customer loyalty, margins and cash flow. That said, it’s a bit concerning that these deals seem to be on an upward trajectory as far as expensiveness and sheer size. Before 2018, Roper’s other software deals were valued in the range of four to five times forward sales. It bought financial-planning software firm PowerPlan Inc. in 2018 for more than seven times sales in  the last big deal overseen by long-time CEO  Brian Jellison. A $529 million takeover of visual-effects software Foundry Visionmongers earlier this year by new CEO Neil Hunn came in at more than seven times sales as well and iPipeline is being valued at more than eight times its expected revenue next year. None of these businesses  have much to do with each other. Maybe that’s fine; maybe you start to wonder  how impervious to scrutiny the vaunted Roper business model really is.  
DuPont de Nemours Inc. Chairman Ed Breen is  reportedly working with advisers to evaluate a sale or spinoff of the company’s nutrition and biosciences division. The business could be valued at more than $20 billion based on the valuations of its publicly traded rivals, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. Breen flagged the possibility of spinoffs or asset sales at a Bernstein conference in May, but for tax reasons, DuPont can’t start holding formal talks with potential buyers until the end of this month, the two-year anniversary of its merger with Dow Chemical. A weak macroeconomic backdrop has overshadowed DuPont’s efforts to unlock shareholder value with a series of post-deal spinoffs. Its own stock is down about 28% over the past year, while its Dow Inc. commodity chemicals arm is down more than 6% since a March spinoff. The Corteva Inc. agricultural business is the exception, up more than 8% since a May separation. The next logical move for a serial breakup artist like Breen is to look for other underappreciated businesses he can carve out, and the relatively fast growing and profitable nutrition and biosciences unit is a good pick. It still feels like financial engineering taken to a new extreme. Possible partners for a tax-advantageous Reverse Morris Trust deal for the nutrition unit include Royal DSM NV, Kerry Group Plc, Givaudan SA and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.
Osram Licht AG’s biggest shareholder  says the 35-euro-per-share takeover bid the company accepted from Bain Capital and Carlyle Group is too low. Allianz Global Investors blasted the Osram board for having such “insufficient confidence in the business they are managing that they have chosen instead to sell out at what looks to be a knock-down price.” My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Chris Hughes  agrees the price is underwhelming, but notes the escalation of the U.S.-China trade tension and the slump in the automotive industry has weakened, not strengthened, the case for buying Osram. This was already a risky deal for the private equity buyers, with about 70% of the acquisition cost – an unusually high proportion –  reportedly to be paid via equity. Getting them to cough up a few extra euros might be a stretch. The fact that Osram management has no backup plan for improving operations if this deal falls apart makes this an even riskier gamble on Allianz’s part, Chris writes. The investor may be wagering on a counteroffer emerging from AMS AG, the Austrian maker of components for Apple Inc.’s iPhone. AMS says talks with potential backers have given it  more confidence in its ability to finance a bid, reversing its stance of just a few weeks earlier when it abruptly  walked away from the prospect of doing due diligence on Osram. But given that AMS has had negative cash flow the past few years, already has a fair amount of debt and has drawn a rebuff from  a German union, Osram’s  work council and  its own shareholders, I wouldn’t hold my breath.  BONUS READING Tariff Fears Caused a U.S. Import Surge.

Maguire has had a “long and distinguished” career in the military, Trump said in a pair of tweets late Thursday. “He commanded at every level, including the Naval Special Warfare Command. He has also served as a National Security Fellow at Harvard University. I have no doubt he will do a great job!”
Trump’s tweet came shortly after he announced that Sue Gordon -- the deputy director of national intelligence -- will resign this month along with Coats, her boss. Gordon would have been next in line to serve as acting director until the Senate confirmed Trump’s choice for a permanent replacement.
Several Trump allies outside the White House had urged the president to remove Gordon, a career intelligence officer, describing her as too close to former CIA Director John Brennan. Brennan has publicly criticized Trump’s leadership, and the president in turn has called him “the worst CIA director in our country’s history.”
Trump had told reporters Friday that he liked Gordon “very much” and said he might appoint her acting director.
But after House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, praised Gordon last month, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, “If Adam Schiff wants her in there, the rumors about her being besties with Brennan and the rest of the clown cadre must be 100% true.”
Trump’s first choice to replace Coats, Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas, withdrew from consideration following public scrutiny of his qualifications for the job and his denunciation of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller at a House hearing.
It’s unclear whom Trump is considering for director of national intelligence, but he has recently spoken with Fred Fleitz, a former chief of staff for the National Security Council. Representative Devin Nunes advised Trump on possible selections but isn’t under consideration himself, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Administration officials also have discussed former Republican Representative Pete Hoekstra for the position, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Trump has indicated he wanted a political loyalist to take charge of the nation’s intelligence community, regarded by some of the president’s allies and supporters as part of a “deep state” intent on undermining him. Attorney General William Barr has opened an investigation of what he has said was “spying” on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.
“We need somebody strong that can really rein it in,” Trump said last month. “Because as I think you’ve all learned, the intelligence agencies have run amok.”
Gordon’s departure may heighten debate among lawmakers about whether the intelligence agencies are being subjected to political interference.
Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence panel that will act on an eventually nominee to replace Coats, said in a statement that Gordon’s departure is “a significant loss for our intelligence community.” But he later added praise of Maguire, saying “I have confidence in his ability to step into this crucial role.”
But Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel’s top Democrat, said in a statement citing the consecutive resignations of Coats and then Gordon that “once again, the president has shown that he has no problem prioritizing his political ego even if it comes at the expense of our national security.""​

Intense competition online and off ratchets up the pressure on upscale stores to innovate.
The market for luxury goods is narrow and becoming more crowded.

The slew of value- and mid-price retailers that have entered bankruptcy in recent years is getting some posh company.
Barneys New York, the upscale department store, said Tuesday that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after reports that it was seeking a lifeline as it grappled with high rents and tough competition. The retailer said it planned to close 15 physical stores. The remaining business will include five flagship department stores, two Warehouse stores and its e-commerce shop.
Barneys isn’t a particularly large chain; Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are close competitors that have more stores. So its closings won’t roil the retail landscape like those of ubiquitous retailers such as Sears or Toys “R” Us. However, thanks to paparazzi photos of Kim Kardashian and other celebrities stopping by its stores, and the reputation of its Freds restaurant as a hub for New York’s elite, it looms large as a defining emblem of American luxury.
Its financial woes are similarly symbolic because they demonstrate just how much the pressure to innovate in the luxury business has ramped up in recent years.
Luxury apparel and accessories brands and stores weren’t exactly at the leading edge of e-commerce, with some in the industry believing that consumers would never migrate en masse to online shopping for expensive pieces that were traditionally sold with high-touch customer service. That notion has been disproved, and online is quickly becoming the category’s most important battleground.

It isn’t that Barneys stood still on e-commerce. I remember interviewing a senior e-commerce executive there in 2015 and thinking the company was making good progress on buzzy industry ideas such as personalization. The problem is competition for a relatively narrow market — meaning shoppers who can shell out $4,820 for a midi dress — is becoming fiercer.
Richemont’s Net-a-Porter has established itself as a go-to digital destination. Matches Fashion, which is based in the U.K. but counts the U.S. as its largest market, is becoming a formidable e-commerce force with a particular emphasis on introducing customers to new, under-the-radar designers. That is something Barneys has also been known for over the years.
Meanwhile, marquee luxury brands are lavishing more attention on their own stores and websites, seeking more control over the customer experience. And resale marketplaces such as Farfetch Ltd. and the RealReal Inc. are putting secondhand luxury inventory at shoppers’ fingertips. In other words, customers who might have defaulted to Barneys five years ago have seen an explosion of other options.
Barneys isn’t just a victim of evolving shopping habits, though. The company said in its press release that it has also been choked by high rents. The Wall Street Journal has reported the rent on its Madison Avenue store has risen to $27.9 million from $16.2 million earlier this year. According to data from CBRE, rents in prime shopping areas in Manhattan have fallen from recent peaks, but they remain elevated from where they were at the beginning of the decade.
Rent for retailers in Manhattan's storied shopping district is not quite as high as it was several years ago, but it remains elevated compared with 2010

It’s clear that the value of the Manhattan or other big city flagships is being re-evaluated up and down the retail food chain. Lord & Taylor closed its storied Manhattan location, and Ralph Lauren Corp. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. have also moved to give up New York flagships. These chains seem to be deciding that they don’t need flashy showpieces, just productive stores.
The trouble is, an ultra-high-end retailer like Barneys does need showpieces. It needs for its stores to be emporiums of rarity and inspiration. Matches Fashion recently set up a temporary shop on a yacht and ferried customers around the Italian Coastline. The renovated Selfridges in London is setting an extremely high bar for what global luxury shopping should look like. Barneys needs to keep up, and having sprawling, well-appointed stores in big cities is part of that.
So, while less-upscale retailers can afford to ditch or shrink their lavish flagships, Barneys simply can’t. And that makes its recovery that much more difficult.
Barneys may emerge from its bankruptcy as a smaller but healthier company. The fact that it ended up here, though, should put the rest of the luxury world on notice. No matter how iconic your brand, you aren’t immune to sweeping change.

Originally published by Jack Forster on Hodinkee.
Watches, it hardly needs to be said, need to be set to be of any use; and to be of any use, they must be set to a time standard that is trustworthy. This is something we scarcely think about today – someone is taking care of it; the Internet is taking care of it or atomic clocks are taking care of it or the US Naval Observatory is taking care of it. For most of the history of watchmaking, however, those resources weren't available, and so other time standards had to be used if you wanted to set your watch precisely. One of my earliest watch-related memories is of dialing a telephone number to get the time – I did not, at age six or seven, yet own a watch but there was something fascinating about calling for the time and hearing a gentle voice say, ""At the tone, the time will be ... "" followed by an announcement of the time, and then, a short beep. 
In the early days of watchmaking – the end of the 16th century and much of the 17th – setting a watch was not a particularly emotionally stressful experience, because watches were not especially accurate anyway. Often they ran for less than a day, and if they kept time to within a half an hour a day, they were performing well. Serious timekeeping was a matter for public clocks, and for sundials. The latter provided probably the most accurate time, as the performance of a sundial is based on the rotation of the Earth, which is extremely stable. The Earth's rotation is slowing ever so slightly thanks to tidal effects from the Moon, but it amounts to a minute lengthening of the day, which has only increased in length by 2.3 milliseconds per century (at least since the 8th century BCE, which is as far back as astronomical records allow us to make an analysis). At night, the time could be told with extreme accuracy by observing stellar transits, which are the times at which a given star crosses a certain point in the night sky – again, this is a measure of the stability of the Earth's orbit, and thus an extremely reliable time standard. The ancient Egyptians, for instance, used a device rather poetically called a merkhet, which means, ""instrument of knowing,"" to observe the transits of stars, in order to tell the time at night. Needless to say, they were not using the merkhet to set watches (unless ancient Egyptian technology was far more sophisticated than we suspect) but the basic principle of using astronomy as most precise time standard continued for many thousands of years, up until almost the present day.
 
Setting a watch, if you were lucky enough to own one in the 16th or 17th century – portable timekeepers were for the rich and often, even if a watch were cased in gold and precious stones, the movement would have been more valuable than the case – was not the obsessive matter that it is today. A sundial would suffice if the day were fine, or, after the development of the first pendulum clocks, a clock. The pendulum clock, as far as we know, was invented by the Dutch mathematician and physicist, Christiaan Huygens, in 1656 and patented the following year; his design was built by clockmaker Salomon Coster. After subsequent refinements to the design – including the invention of the deadbeat escapement by the Englishman Richard Towneley, in 1657, which was notably used for two precision regulators made by Tompion, for the Greenwich Observatory, in 1676 – the pendulum clock would be the most accurate timekeeping device, period, up until the beginning of the production of practical quartz clocks in the mid-20th century.
It is interesting for watch lovers to reflect on the fact that from a technical perspective, the most fundamental problems in precision timekeeping were solved by pendulum clocks by the end of the 17th century (there were continual refinements later, including during the 20th century, but all the basic elements were there long before) and that the watch would spend the next two centuries or so, basically trying to catch up. 
Public clocks in their earliest incarnations were often not much better timekeepers than watches, thanks to the erratic performance of the verge escapement (the earliest known type of clock escapement, other than some of the escapements used on sophisticated water clocks) but gradually, many of the earliest tower clocks had their verge escapements replaced with pendulums and anchor escapements. Later, high-precision, constant-force gravity escapements, such as the one used in the great clock in the Tower of Westminster, (better known as Big Ben) came into use. Other than astronomical observations, the tolling of the time by such clocks, and of course, their dials, provided the most reliable time standard for anyone wanting to set the time accurately on their watch.
One of the most interesting public time standards are so-called time balls, the first experience of which, for many of us, was probably seeing the ball drop at midnight over Times Square, New York, on New Year's Eve. As it turns out, using the drop of a large ball as a signaling device is a – well, I suppose you could say, time honored way of transmitting the time visually; it has the advantage over a bell, of showing a precise moment in time. The system is quite old – supposedly the Greeks used the drop of a time ball as a time signal in the city of Gaza, after the death of Alexander the Great – and they were much used to transmit the time to ships at harbor from a station on land, so mariners could set their chronometers before setting sail. One of the best known time balls is on top of the Octagon Room at the Greenwich Observatory, and was installed in 1833; it has been dropping at 1:00 PM every day ever since (in the United States it is apparently customary to drop the ball at noon instead). 
Generally, the procedure seems to have been to start lifting the time ball five minutes or so before the hour, in order to alert the ships at anchor that the time signal was about to be sent; the time was recorded at the moment the ball began to drop, not when it reached the bottom. There are several dozen time balls still in operation around the world, including (to pick just one) the Deal Time Ball, in Deal, England (Deal was an important anchorage for fighting ships during the Napoleonic Wars). The Deal Time Ball was actually triggered remotely, by a telegraph signal from the Royal Observatory. In some locations, the time was signaled by firing a gun – these were set off at different times depending on the location, although noon has always been a perennial favorite. In Cape Town, South Africa, a noon gun is still fired as it has been every day at noon since 1806, from a battery on Signal Hill. There is also a famous 9:00 gun fired every night in Vancouver, British Columbia – this particular cannon is a muzzle-loader, a 12-pounder for you naval history buffs, which was cast in 1816 and has the crests of George III and the First Earl of Mulgrave, who was Master-General of Ordnance, on the barrel.
The invention of the telegraph provided the ability for multiple locations to not only receive an accurate time signal more or less instantaneously, but also to be coordinated to the same time; this was especially essential for the railroads, the development of which spurred the evolution of time zones. The problem of setting a watch accurately had become much simpler, although a fundamental transition had occurred. For most of the history of timekeeping, the time in question was local time; to put it in simplest terms, noon was when the Sun stood at its zenith in the sky. Then, gradually, the concept of mean time evolved – mean time relies on the notion of a day of average length, which is the same throughout the year, rather than on the solar day, which can vary by a quarter of an hour or more either way, depending on the time of year. The difference between mean local time and solar time is in fact nothing other than the famous Equation of Time, and to aid in setting clocks by a sundial (in your country manor home, far from the madding crowd where the tolling of Big Ben would have been inaudible, perhaps) pendulum clocks often had tables for the Equation of Time pasted inside their cabinets, for easy reference.
The telegraph, time balls, and the dials and bells of telegraph controlled public clocks, began the era of widely available precision time, and thanks to the telegraph, railway station clocks became as precise and reliable a time standard as any other public clocks. Several inventions, however, combined to make accurate time references even more widely available: the telephone, radio, and that infamous corrupter of youth, the television. 
The broadcasting of time signals over radio networks made telegraphy obsolete for both clocks and watches, radio stations began broadcasting time signals over general use radio networks, for the edification of the public, as early as 1922, when the BBC began the practice. In 1926 the Bulova Watch Company of New York broadcast the first radio advertisement with a time signal – 'At the tone, it's eight o'clock, Bulova watch time,"" and on July 1, 1941, the very first TV ad was broadcast – this was also a Bulova ad, which was unlike much modern advertising, a model of concision and simplicity. Through the miracle of the Internet we can still enjoy this advertisement on YouTube.
Accurate time standards by which to set one's watch continued to become more and more ubiquitous. My earliest memory of such a standard, designed to enable anyone to accurately set their watch or clock, was simply calling a time service. In 2016, The Atlantic's Adrienne LaFrance wrote a wonderful reminiscence about using a telephone to call for the time; she writes, in part: 
""The first two telephone numbers a little kid learns are usually 911 and their own.""
""When I was about 5 years old, I decided to call 911—just to see what would happen, even though I knew I wasn’t supposed to. When a dispatcher answered, I promptly hung up. They promptly called back.""
""This led to a conversation I suspect many mothers have had with many curious children. It must have been around the same era when I learned of what seemed at the time to be a great secret of telephony. There was another number I could call, and I could call it any time and as many times as I wanted, without getting in trouble.""
The number varied depending on your location, but the result was generally a soothing voice, saying pleasantly, ""At the tone, the time will be,"" followed by the time, and then an equally pleasant beep. Various automated systems evolved over the years and surprisingly, LaFrance reports, quite a few people still like to call and get the time; interviewed for the story, the chief scientist for time services at the US Naval Observatory, Demetrios Matsakis, said that they get around 3 million calls per year. If you ring up the USNO time service number you will hear the time given by a voice that sounds straight out of Mission Control circa 1965. That voice is none other than Mr. Fred Covington (1928-1993) known for such films as The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings, and The Battle Of Chickamagua(narrator). He became the voice of USNO time in 1978, and though he has passed since then into that realm wherein Time giveth way to Eternity, you can still hear his voice, reciting the time on demand, by dialing 202-762-1401.
Electronic time signals – first from the telegraph, then the telephone, radio, and TV – made things like the time ball, cannon, and public clocks obsolete as practical time references; they exist today for cultural and historical reasons, not because we need them to set our watches. The necessity for a daily accurate time reference, already considerably diminished by ongoing improvements in mechanical watch technology during the 20th century, decreased further with the advent first of tuning fork watch technology (in the Accutron and other tuning fork movements) and with the appearance of quartz watches, in 1969, which made timepieces accurate to within a minute or less per month, more or less ubiquitous. Still, owners of wristwatches, quartz or mechanical, still need to set their timepieces occasionally, and lots of us enjoy checking the accuracy of our mechanical watches against a reliable reference. 
For many the time displayed on their cell phone is more than accurate enough, and for good reasons. In order for the Internet to function, it's necessary for system clocks in mobile devices and computers to be synchronized precisely, across the entire network. The Network Time Protocol is designed to synchronize participating devices to within a few milliseconds of UTC, which is a time standard that is, in turn, regulated by International Atomic Time, which is an average of the time kept by over 400 atomic clocks in over 50 national labs around the world. (Many modern electronic watches can obtain the time from GPS or radio signals, which are also regulated by atomic clocks and such watches effectively never need to be set, except perhaps for local transitions to and from Daylight Saving Time). The HODINKEE app uses the time generated by the system clock on the iPhone. Originally both the HODINKEE and Watchville apps synchronized directly with Internet time servers via NTP, but with the release of iOS 9, our developers noticed that the amount of drift between NTP and the iPhone's clock had decreased significantly – so much so that the apps no longer need to obtain the time directly from NTP.
The act of setting a watch is an interesting one philosophically and psychologically. You are attempting to make your watch as accurate as possible but in setting it to a time signal or other time standard, you are also acknowledging the limitations of the watch itself. Watches keep getting more and more accurate, however, which is a pleasant surprise if you are afraid that the art of watchmaking is stagnating. Several companies – Omega, Rolex, Grand Seiko, Citizen, and others – continue to invest considerable time, energy and effort into making more accurate watches; in fact Citizen, earlier this year, announced the most accurate and most precise watch ever made, in over 500 years of watchmaking, so clearly time and progress both march on, at least as far as watches are concerned. 
As watchmaking improves, access to an atomic-clock accurate standard becomes less of a necessity, and more a way of enjoying and observing the degree to which one's watch, or watches, precisely measure the passage of time – and how close we can get to the centuries-old dream, of set it and forget it.

A New York Police Department administrative judge ruled that a white officer should be fired for his actions five years ago for the choking of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man whose death while under arrest helped ignite the national Black Lives Matter movement.
NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Trials Rosemarie Maldonado, who presided over disciplinary hearings in May, recommended Officer Daniel Pantaleo be dismissed for the July 2014 incident, according to the board. Garner, 43, was killed in a confrontation with police on a Staten Island sidewalk for selling untaxed cigarettes. A viral video showed Pantaleo subduing Garner with a chokehold, which the department prohibits, as Garner cried, “I can’t breathe.”
“Today’s decision confirms what the Civilian Complaint Review Board always has maintained: Officer Daniel Pantaleo committed misconduct on July 17, 2014, and his actions caused the death of Eric Garner,” the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which prosecuted the case said Friday in a news release. “The evidence the CCRB’s prosecutors brought forth at trial was more than sufficient to prove that Pantaleo is unfit to serve.”
A final decision on the officer’s future will be made by Police Commissioner James O’Neill later this month. Since the incident, Pantaleo has been on modified desk duty, drawing salary and benefits totaling more than $100,000 a year. Effective today and pending O’Neill’s decision, Pantaleo has been suspended without pay for 30 days, as is the longstanding practice in these matters when the recommendation is termination, said police department spokesman Phillip Walzak.
The deaths of Garner and Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, served as flash points, prompting nationwide demonstrations. Garner’s death also has harmed Mayor Bill de Blasio’s relationship with the department’s rank-and-file officers, as the mayor pushed to equip officers with body cameras and institute department-wide sensitivity training to de-escalate hostile encounters.
The incident has drawn national attention to de Blasio’s record as mayor as he embarks on a long shot presidential campaign. During this week’s televised debate between Democratic candidates for 2020, rivals said he should have fired Pantaleo five years ago. Demonstrators disrupted the debate shouting “Fire Pantaleo!” and “I can’t breathe!” until they were removed from the audience.
A Staten Island grand jury declined to prosecute Pantaleo in 2014, and last month the U.S. Justice Department also said it would not charge the officer after a five-year review. De Blasio said he regretted waiting for those agencies’ to review the case before instituting disciplinary action. The mayor has repeatedly said federal prosecutors asked him to defer any action while they reviewed the case.
In January 2015, James McGovern, the chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division under then President Barack Obama “requested we hold our process while they conducted their own” and Attorney General Loretta Lynch repeated the request six months later, de Blasio press secretary Freddi Goldstein said.
“Today for the first time in these long five years, the system of justice is working,” de Blasio said during a City Hall news conference. “Today we finally saw a step toward justice and accountability. We saw a process that was fair and impartial and I hope that this will now bring the Garner family a sense of closure.”
Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, continued to blame de Blasio and the police department who she said “put up roadblocks and delays at every step of the way.” She also demanded disciplinary trials for at least three other officers involved in arresting her son.
Pat Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the patrol officers’ union, vowed to appeal the decision in court if O’Neill doesn’t reverse it, calling it “pure political insanity” in response to pressure from the mayor.
“If allowed to stand,” he said, “it will paralyze the NYPD for years to come.” Citing state and federal prosecutors’ decisions not to charge Pantaleo with a crime, Lynch said “this judge ignored the evidence and trampled P.O. Pantaleo’s due process rights.”

On Thursday night, he was back on his favorite territory: A rally of political supporters at an arena in Cincinnati, Ohio, that really needed to offer much more than what we’re accustomed to hearing from him at these gatherings. 
The president failed to deliver at both events. This should remind voters who Trump is and the challenges he faces as the outlines of the 2020 presidential campaign become clearer and the shape of his opposition from Democrats comes into focus.
The gathering Trump hosted at the White House Monday was straightforward and meant to be  bracing and reaffirming for everyone involved. The president was on hand to sign a bill into law that would provide permanent medical care and compensation to the Sept. 11 responders. But he couldn’t help himself. A compassionate speech sounded all the right, sympathetic notes until he made it about himself. 
“I was down there also, but I’m not considering myself a first responder,” Trump said of the site where the World Trade Center once stood. “But I was down there. I spent a lot of time down there with you.”
Oof. Not true. And by inserting himself into history and into a moment that quite properly belonged to the emergency services themselves, Trump shifted attention from the ceremony and onto himself. A wave of fact-checking and media reports followed. There was no evidence that he spent any meaningful time at Ground Zero, nor that he had, as he claimed on the campaign trail in 2016, helped “clear the rubble” there while he worried that the buildings would collapse on “all of us.” There was no evidence to support his fable that he sent more than 100 of his own workers to help at the site or his lie about seeing thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the attack. Trump did take time on Sept. 11 to say that the collapse of the World Trade Center would make one of his buildings the tallest in Manhattan’s financial district. That wasn’t true, either.
On Tuesday evening, Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization executive, told MSNBC that Trump’s use of tragedies to promote himself wasn’t limited to Sept. 11. She said he’d also lied about narrowly avoiding dying in a helicopter crash in 1989 that killed three of his casino executives. I noted in a tweet on Thursday that the families of two of those executives, Steve Hyde and Mark Etess, also knew that Trump lied about avoiding the crash – and that he did so to get media attention for himself after their deaths instead of just honoring them.
My tweet prompted George Conway, a lawyer and prominent Trump critic, to post an article on Twitter recalling that the eulogy Trump delivered at his own father’s funeral in 1999 was largely self-referential. I knew this to be true and responded to Conway with some details about the eulogy that Alan Marcus, a former Trump adviser, had shared with me. Trump began the eulogy, Marcus recalled, more or less like this: “I was in my Trump Tower apartment reading about how I was having the greatest year in my career in the New York Times when the security desk called to say my brother Robert was coming upstairs.” Marcus said “there was an audible gasp” from mourners stunned by Trump’s self-regard. (My exchanges with Conway resulted in the creation of a Twitter hashtag, #TrumpEulogies, featuring satirical, fictional and self-referential funeral orations from the president). 
Trump’s self-absorption has been profound of late. He has invited widespread criticism (except from members of his own political party) for weeks of hostile, racist comments directed at Democrats of color. He has pushed for brutal confrontations with migrants on the U.S.’s southern border to solve a humanitarian crisis created by his own policies. He’s escalated a trade war with China even though the impact of the battle lands most heavily and adversely on the consumers and farmers Trump should be courting for his 2020 bid. He has harangued the Federal Reserve relentlessly to lower interest rates and the Fed did so for the first time in a decade on Wednesday. While Trump’s lobbying could be motivated by his own macroeconomic insights, it’s hard not to wonder if he’s strong-arming the Fed to juice the economy so it and securities markets remain buoyant ahead of the 2020 election.
At his Cincinnati rally Thursday night Trump unspooled familiar themes. In a flood of self-aggrandizing talking points, he attacked the Democrats, the media, the judiciary, Hillary Clinton, and Robert Mueller; extolled the virtues of supporters who adore him; slagged the city of Baltimore and the state of California for the umpteenth time; invented some new history for Russia; dumped on immigrants; took credit for legislation helping military veterans that Barack Obama actually signed; and pledged to “keep America great.” Oh, and he promised to cure cancer. 
There was a lot in that Cincinnati grab bag that appealed to the president’s most loyal fans. It’s not clear, though, whether any of the bombast helps Trump expand his electoral franchise beyond his base or makes his case effectively to voters in a handful of swing states in the Midwest and elsewhere that will probably determine who wins the White House in 2020.
It’s always a mistake to assume Trump thinks strategically rather than viscerally, anyhow. And his Cincinnati rhetoric is in keeping with his Rose Garden performance on Monday and the eulogy he delivered at his father’s funeral 20 years ago: Narcissistic and self-serving. Trump is being Trump, and it’s not certain that the circumstances that allowed him to get away with that in 2016 will be so accommodating this time around. If the less committed voter has tired of the act, Trump’s self-worship may prove to be self-defeating.

It’s the lunch that’s set to seal the fate of Brexit.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold private talks with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday, to explore whether the two sides can find room to compromise.
With just three weeks left until the U.K. is due to leave the European Union, negotiations have stalled and the time for striking an orderly separation agreement is almost up.
The stakes for the meeting, at a secret location in north-west England, could hardly be higher. The two leaders will need to find common cause if talks are not to collapse entirely. The atmosphere surrounding the negotiations has turned sour in recent days as the two sides blamed each other for their failure to make progress.
“I’m still cautiously, cautiously optimistic,” Johnson said as he described the negotiations he’s had with Britain’s “friends and partners in the EU.”
A deal is “extremely difficult, but not impossible,” Ireland’s Health Minister Simon Harris said in a RTE radio interview on Thursday.
On the Irish side, no breakthrough is considered imminent, according to a person familiar with the matter. An extension is still seen as the most likely outcome, though the situation is unpredictable before Varadkar’s meeting with Johnson and any new offer from London, the person said.
Despite the U.K. premier’s soothing tone, European politicians continued to react strongly to what they see as the “blame game” initiated by Johnson’s officials, who have accused Germany’s Angela Merkel of making a deal essentially impossible.
“We are not accepting this blame game which started in London -- we are not to be blamed,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Wednesday.
The key hurdle is how to ensure there are no customs checkpoints at Ireland’s land border with the U.K. In his latest plan, Johnson proposed limited customs checks away from the frontier, but Varadkar insists any such inspections will threaten peace in the region, which suffered decades of terrorism.
The EU’s remaining 27 member states will be guided by Ireland’s position. If Johnson can convince Varadkar to move, there is a chance a deal could be outlined ahead of the crucial summit of EU leaders Oct. 17-18. At this point, the Irish government is minded to resist any effort to impose a time limit or any mechanism which allows a unilateral exit from measures designed to avoid a return to hard border on the island of Ireland.
On Wednesday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier rejected the U.K.’s proposal to work out the mechanism for customs checks during a post-Brexit transition period. Putting these decisions off would risk leading to “no checks whatsoever,” and that would damage the EU’s single market, Barnier said.
“We’re not really in a position where we’re able to find an agreement,” Barnier said. It’s possible “if there’s goodwill on both sides.”
Barnier also criticized the U.K.’s plan to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto over the deal. Johnson’s team say it’s vital to allow the region’s community to give “consent” for the future arrangements on the border.
But for the EU, allowing a veto for Northern Irish politicians would undermine the point of a long-term guarantee against a hard border going up at the frontier.
Both sides want clarity on the status of the negotiations by the end of the week. If the talks do break down in the days ahead, the U.K. will either be headed for a no-deal split or a humiliating third delay to the divorce, an outcome Johnson himself has vowed never to permit but which the EU is ready to grant.
Under legislation passed by Parliament against Johnson’s will, he’s required to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if he hasn’t gained approval for a new deal by Oct. 19. It’s something he’s vowed publicly he won’t do, though the government’s lawyers have told the courts he will. On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom told ITV it would be “reasonable“ for Johnson to send a second letter to the EU saying that he personally doesn’t want a delay.
Leadsom also said no version of a deal that includes the Irish backstop -- a fallback provision guaranteeing no hard border after Brexit -- would be acceptable, even if the EU agreed to put a time limit on it.

Italy sold $7 billion of bonds, more than double an initial estimate, in its first offering of U.S. dollar-denominated securities since 2010.
Europe’s second-most-indebted nation received orders surpassing $18 billion, helping it to widen its investor base by tapping the U.S. market. It sold $2.5 billion each of five- and 30-year bonds, as well as $2 billion of 10-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Italy’s ability to increase the size of the sale is another sign that the hunt for yield is on -- earlier Wednesday Greece sold three-month bills with a negative yield for the first time, while Austria and Portugal are among other euro-area nations to have sold debt at record-low yields this week.
Italy has drawn more investors in recent months as a new coalition government reduced friction with Brussels over its budget. That’s helped its bonds post the euro area’s best performance this year with a 13% return, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes.
The 10-year dollar-denominated securities priced at 150 basis points over mid-swaps, equating to a yield of about 3%, almost double the level for equivalent U.S. Treasuries.
Yields on Italy’s 10-year euro bonds rose two basis points Wednesday to 0.87%, in line with moves across the region. Yields have slid 188 basis points this year, touching a record low last month. For a U.S.-based investor buying the euro bonds and switching back into dollars, that would turn into a currency-hedged yield of about 2.75%, meaning an effective premium of about 25 basis points for those opting for the new dollar bonds, according to Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S.
Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. arranged the dollar bond sale.

The sale of Iamgold Corp. has stalled after the mid-tier Canadian gold miner failed to reach an agreement with several Chinese suitors, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Chinese gold producers including China National Gold Group Corp., Shandong Gold Mining Co. and Zijin Mining Group Co. had all shown interest in Iamgold, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. But discussions stumbled over price as well as concerns related to ongoing Sino-Canada political tensions, the people said.
Though talks have stalled, it’s still possible a suitor may re-enter with a better offer, according to one of the people. The Canadian company could also decide to pursue other options, such as selling a stake in its Cote project, the people said. Representatives for Iamgold, China National Gold, Shandong Gold and Zijin Mining declined to comment.
Shares of Iamgold closed 2.6% lower at C$4.86 on Wednesday in Toronto trading, after dropping as much as 3.6%. The stock has risen about 2.1% in the past 12 months, giving it a market value of C$2.27 billion ($1.7 billion.)
Gold is near a six-year high, and the amount of gold reserves still buried in mines is down by more than half from a 2011 peak. Miners of the precious metal are seeking to secure sources of the material by snapping up rivals. Acquisitions of gold producers have jumped to $18.2 billion this year, the highest level in eight years, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
Iamgold operates four producing mines, including Westwood Gold Mfine in Canada and joint ventures in Mali. It produced 882,000 ounces of gold in 2018 and has about 24,116,000 ounces of total proven and probable reserves, according to its website.
China National Gold, the country’s second-largest miner of the metal, is studying a bid for a stake in the Canadian gold producer, Bloomberg News reported in June. The company is on the hunt for acquisitions to replenish its pipeline, according to Jerry Xie, executive vice president for China Gold International Resources Corp., the overseas subsidiary of the state-owned firm.
A diplomatic feud over the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Canadian soil has escalated since December and resulted in Beijing detaining two Canadians, halting imports of canola and banning meat shipments from Canada.

In the history of Donald Trump’s presidency, tweets mentioning China have tended to be bad news for the S&P 500. The good news is, he’s been tweeting about it less.
Data compiled by Bloomberg News showed that since the start of 2017, the U.S. president’s tweets included the word “China” or “trade” on 208 days when U.S. stock markets were open. Comparing S&P 500 daily performance and those instances, regardless of whether it was positive or negative, showed the number of up and down closes on those days are about equal. However, the losses were bigger than the gains. There were 17 days that saw a fall of more than 1.5%, and only five days of advances bigger than 1.5%.

Cumulative returns over those 208 days was a decline of 14%, while any investor that bought the U.S. benchmark at the end of 2016, and has since held that position would have seen a 30% price gain. The impact of the U.S. president’s tweets extends beyond stocks -- they have also had a sometimes-sizable impact on Fed funds futures, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysis.

Of course, Trump’s Twitter account -- and whether it features China -- is but one of the many drivers of markets. Among others, there’s slowing factory growth and inverted yield curves. Yet it’s undeniable that when the U.S. president tweets, everyone listens. That was the case in May, when Trump tweeted that he would increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%. That effectively kicked negotiations into the long grass, and sent the S&P 500 down more than 6% for the month.
The silver lining for investors is that recently, the U.S. president appears have been focused more on the House impeachment inquiry rather than the trade war with China.
An analysis of Trump’s tweets in the past 30 days showed words that appeared most frequently included “Schiff”, “Ukraine” and “conversation”. That compared with the previous 30-day period, which saw more occurrences of the words such as “trade” and “tariffs”. The number of mentions of “China” dropped from 49 to 19, now matching mentions of “impeachment”. There was no mention of those three words since Monday. The analysis did not account for whether the tweets were positive or negative in nature. It also excluded the most common English prepositions, pronouns and verbs, as well as words frequently used by Trump, such as “great” and “president”.

Botswana raised the alarm over a “deeply worrying” surge in rhinoceros poaching after two of the animals were killed in one week, bringing the total number of rhino deaths to nine since April.
While the size of the southern African nation’s wild rhino population is small compared to some of its neighbors, the government has been praised for the success of its conservation policies and has received rhinos from other countries to protect.

“We have been losing about a rhino a month to poaching, losing two in one week is unacceptable,” the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism said in a rare emailed statement to address poaching.
“If the poaching continues at this rate there will be no rhinos in Botswana in a year or two, especially the black rhino, a ‘critically endangered species’,” the ministry said Wednesday.
Conservationists criticized the government earlier this year after it withdrew heavy weapons from its anti-poachning units and lifted a ban on wildlife hunting, a decision that was largely motivated by the threat to farmers posed by Botswana’s large elephant population. While Botswana plans on earning a higher income from trophy hunting, it won’t allow the killing of rhinos.
Anti-poaching forces have now made the protection of rhinos their highest priority, with two poachers having lost their lives during operations recently, the ministry said. Black rhinos are largely kept in private sanctuaries and their numbers are not publicly known.
Neighboring South Africa, which is home to almost all of the world’s rhinos, said in February it recorded a 25% plunge in rhino deaths last year. The animals are targeted for their horns, which are believed in Asia to help cure cancer and boost male virility.

The Justice Department said it’s turned over to the House Judiciary Committees FBI reports on interviews of 17 people in response to a court order to produce still-secret materials from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.
Here are the latest developments:
The Justice Department said it has handed over FBI interview notes on the following people: Chris Christie, Michael Cohen; Rick Dearborn; Uttam Dhillon; John Kelly; Jared Kushner; Cory Lewandowski; Paul Manafort; Mary McCord; K.T. McFarland ; Stephen Miller; Rob Porter; Rod Rosenstein; Christopher Ruddy; Sarah Sanders; Sean Spicer; and Sally Yates.
The Justice Department estimated that for many of the interviews, less than 20 percent of the content is redacted. The department also said it anticipates making more such interviews available “so long as they do not adversely impact ongoing investigations and cases” and maintain the confidentiality of executive branch “interests.” Those interviews include: Stephen Bannon; Dana Boente; James Burnham; James Comey; Annie Donaldson; John Eisenberg; Michael Flynn; Rick Gates; Hope Hicks; Jody Hunt; Andrew McCabe; Don McGahn; Reince Priebus; James Rybicki; and Jeff Sessions.
Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on Tuesday canceled his scheduled testimony before House impeachment investigators looking into President Donald Trump’s activities involving Ukraine.
Three House committees issued a subpoena demanding that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, appear for testimony on Oct. 16 and produce records from his personal devices two days earlier.Sondland had been scheduled to testify Tuesday morning, but the committees learned less than an hour before the closed-door hearing was to begin that he had been ordered by the Trump administration not to appear.Sondland has told the House committees that he turned the records over to the State Department, which has refused to provide them to Congress.
“There is no valid basis to withhold documents from the committees by relying on instructions from Secretary Pompeo,” the chairmen said.
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter Tuesday that Trump and his administration won’t participate in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry.
“You have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,” Cipollone wrote in an eight-page letter laying out the White House’s concerns about the inquiry. “Put simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen.”
The House Judiciary Committee asked a federal judge in Washington to allow access to still-secret materials from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, contending that they’re needed for the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.
Justice Department lawyers opposed the request, arguing that lawmakers haven’t shown they’re entitled to override grand jury secrecy. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, said in a friend-of-the-court brief that without a formal House vote, the impeachment inquiry doesn’t meet the standard of a “judicial proceeding” that might entitle Democrats to the records.
Chief Judge Beryl Howell questioned what power the Justice Department has to require the House “to demonstrate that it is starting an impeachment inquiry?”
The judge cited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Sept. 24 statement that an inquiry had been initiated, as well as the committee’s authorization granted in July to pursue grand jury materials.
Howell didn’t rule on the Democrats’ request. She ordered both sides to submit additional information.
Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he’s not certain whether he’ll take up Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham’s invitation to testify about Ukraine matters because his information may be privileged.
“Love Lindsey, but I am still a lawyer and I will have to deal with privilege,” Giuliani told CNN. He added, “Given the nature of his invitation about my concerns I might be able to do it without discussing privileged information.” -- Billy House
Three House committees said they are subpoenaing one of Trump’s top diplomats to provide documents and testimony after the State Department blocked him from appearing before the panels less than an hour before a closed-door hearing was to start.
The Democratic chairmen said that among the things they’re seeking from are “communications from his personal devices” that Sondland has turned over to the State Department.
The State Department is withholding them from the committee, in defiance of a subpoena to Secretary Michael Pompeo, the chairmen said. -- Billy House
Joe Biden’s spokesman called Rudy Giuliani a “noted conspiracist and liar” and said calling him to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee would “further discredit” the panel’s reputation under Chairman Lindsey Graham.
Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said in an emailed statement, “At this rate, all that comes out of Rudy Giuliani’s mouth is just a noun, a verb, and a disproven lie about Joe Biden.” -- Billy House
Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham offered Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani the chance to appear before the panel to discuss his allegations related to Ukraine.
“Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by @RudyGiuliani about corruption in Ukraine,” Graham tweeted in a veiled reference to allegations that Giuliani and Trump have made about Joe Biden and his son. -- Steven T. Dennis
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said the Trump administration’s decision to block testimony from a U.S. envoy central to an impeachment inquiry amounts to obstruction of Congress.
Sondland’s testimony to three panels leading the impeachment probe scheduled for Tuesday morning was abruptly canceled after the State Department ordered him not to appear.
Schiff said the State Department also is withholding other records, including text messages.
Republican Representative Jim Jordan said that the treatment of other witnesses by Democrats was part of the reason the administration pulled back from Sondland’s appearance. He said the American people “have a right to know who the whistle-blower is.” -- Billy House
Trump said he “would love to send” Gordon Sondland to testify before the U.S. House in its impeachment inquiry but said the U.S. ambassador to the European Union wouldn’t get a fair hearing from Congressional Democrats.
“Unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican’s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.
Trump tweeted the statement hours after Sondland’s lawyers issued a statement saying the State Department had blocked him from appearing. Sondland had been scheduled to give a deposition Tuesday morning. -- Nick Wadhams
The State Department directed Sondland to cancel his scheduled testimony Tuesday, according to a letter from his attorney.
Robert Luskin, the lawyer representing Sondland, said his client was ready to appear voluntarily to respond to the committee’s questions behind closed doors, but the the State Department instructed the U.S. ambassador to the European Union to not show up. Luskin said Sondland had already worked out the logistics of his testimony with committee staff.
“Ambassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today,” Luskin’s letter said. “Ambassador Sondland hopes that the issues raised by the State Department that preclude his testimony will be resolved promptly. He stands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear.”
Who’s Who: The Americans at the Center of Trump’s Ukraine Gambit
Sondland, a hotel executive who donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, came under increased scrutiny last week after Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, turned over text messages in his closed deposition that detailed Sondland’s involvement in Ukraine issues. The texts show Sondland defending the efforts of Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to get Ukraine to look into Joe Biden and his son, even over concerns raised by other diplomats.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said he will make a statement at 9:30 a.m. on Sondland’s cancellation. -- Billy House
A Washington Post poll showed 61% of respondents believe Democrats are “making a necessary stand against Trump’s actions” by opening an impeachment inquiry, and 53% said Democrats are “acting to uphold their constitutional duties.”
That result is good news for Democrats who are trying to present the impeachment process as a serious responsibility for elected officials confronting allegations of presidential wrongdoing.
=Nancy Pelosi announces Trump’s impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24.
Approval of how Democrats have handled the inquiry is split, with 49% of respondents saying they approve and 44% saying they disapprove. Republicans receive lower marks for their handling of the situation, with 33% of respondents approving and 56% disapproving.
Overall support for beginning the impeachment probe is at 58%, while 49% say the House should actually impeach Trump and recommend that the Senate remove him from office.
The poll was conducted Oct. 1-6 by the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

Enticingly low borrowing costs in euros might be great for companies looking to refinance debt. But they’re about to become a major headache half-way across the globe from Europe: in Taiwan.
Taiwanese insurance companies binged on more than $180 billion of Formosa bonds -- notes listed in Taiwan but denominated mainly in dollars since regulators exempted them from restrictions on foreign investments. The securities helped the funds get yields unavailable in the local market.
But as a wave of these bonds approach the dates when the issuers can call them, the risk is that the Taiwanese investors will be handed back their cash and forced to hunt for alternative securities. That’s because of attractive rates for borrowers in Europe.
“Formosa is set for a redemption wave,” said Ruslan Bikbov, a rates strategist at Citigroup Inc. “If rates stay where they are or go lower, as we expect, then calls are pretty much automatic.”

One recent example was Verizon Communications Inc. The New York-based telecoms giant last month called a $2.06 billion bond -- one of the largest issued in the Formosa market. The security due in 2046 had a coupon of 4.2%. Verizon then sold debt in euros and British pounds at cheaper cost, even if swapped back into dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Companies including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp., Apple Inc. and Pfizer Inc. are facing similar decisions. Some $8 billion of Formosa bonds have callable dates by year-end. Another $22.4 billion reach their next call date in the first quarter of 2020.
“Some Formosa bonds we bought were already called this year, and we expect the trend will last until at least 1Q next year,” said Hung-Sheng Chen, chief financial officer at Taipei-based Mercuries Life Insurance Co.
Mercuries Life will look at options including Taiwanese dollar-denominated exchange-traded funds that track foreign assets, Chen said.
Some issuers may decide not to call their Formosa bonds, to maintain their relationship with Taiwanese investors. But this if history is any guide, that’s unlikely to stem the tide. Borrowers redeemed almost $11 billion of Formosa bonds back in 2016, when U.S. dollar rates plummeted.
“Will we have more bonds called? The answer is yes,” said Rick Chan, a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. LLC, which oversees $1.84 trillion. “If I am one of those corporates who issued one of these bonds, my job is to do what is most economical for my company, which is to call these bonds.”

Kremlin-directed operatives opened champagne when Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, according to a communication disclosed in a new Senate Intelligence Committee report outlining Russia’s sweeping social media efforts to help him win.
“We uncorked a tiny bottle of champagne ... took one gulp each and looked into each other’s eyes .... We uttered almost in unison: ‘We made America great,’” one operative at the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency said in the message obtained by the Republican-led committee.
The long-pending report by the Intelligence panel concluded that Russia directed an aggressive social media campaign to hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump in the 2016 presidential election and warns similar efforts to interfere in U.S. politics are still under way. It was a bipartisan endorsement of the finding made by U.S. intelligence agencies and often questioned by Trump.
The report, two years in the making, found that the Internet Research Agency “was overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump to the detriment of Secretary Clinton’s campaign.” As part of that effort, it targeted African-Americans through social media more than any other group.
Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said the Russian interference campaign hasn’t ended and other adversaries are engaged in similar attacks.
“Russia is waging an information warfare campaign against the U.S. that didn’t start and didn’t end with the 2016 election,” he said. “Their goal is broader: to sow societal discord and erode public confidence in the machinery of government.”
Burr said Russia floods social media with false reports, conspiracy theories and trolls to breed distrust. “While Russia may have been the first to hone the modern disinformation tactics outlined in this report, other adversaries, including China, North Korea, and Iran, are following suit.”
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee’s top Democrat, warned of more interference to come in next year’s election. “There’s no doubt that bad actors will continue to try to weaponize the scale and reach of social media platforms to erode public confidence and foster chaos,” he said.
Warner said Congress should act to require transparency from social media companies and disclosure of political ads online.
The committee had previously released portions of its analysis. The findings parallel the intelligence agencies’ conclusions as well as parts of the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Among the findings were efforts by the Kremlin-directed IRA to convert social media into real-world actions. Operatives posing as U.S. political activists also “sought help from the Trump campaign to procure campaign materials and to organize and promote rallies.”
Trump has at times cited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assurances that Russia didn’t meddle in the 2016 election, and the president has pursued in recent months a fringe theory that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to trigger an FBI investigation of election meddling that he’s often called a “witch hunt.”
Among the report’s recommendations is for the Trump administration to “publicly reinforce the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.” The committee suggested creating a task force to monitor other nations’ social media interference efforts and develop a framework for deterrence.
The committee also recommended that social media companies share more information about election interference with each other, as they have with extremist content, as well as providing it to government agencies and researchers. It also called for more publicity about the existence of influence operations.
The panel urged that lawmakers consider expanding to social media the existing transparency requirements for political advertising on TV or the radio. Facebook, Google and Twitter have all put together ad transparency databases, but differences between them persist and legislative vehicles, such as the “Honest Ads Act” that Warner supports, have stalled.
Senator Kamala Harris, a member of the Intelligence Committee who’s running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a statement that the Russian tactics were “designed to suppress the votes of black Americans in particular” and that social media companies must step up their efforts to fight disinformation. She said they need to “ensure their workforces are diverse enough to identify and understand the cultural nuances that foreign actors exploit to divide and harm Americans.”

House impeachment investigators said they will issue a subpoena to one of President Donald Trump’s top diplomats, who was blocked Tuesday by the State Department from testifying before congressional committees.
The move kept Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from his appearance before the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees in the latest escalation of the stand-off between the administration and Congress over witnesses.
“We consider this interference to be obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,” the chairmen of the three House committees said in a statement. “We will be issuing subpoena to Ambassador Sondland for both his testimony and documents.”
The subpoena will also seek text messages and emails from Sondland’s personal device, which the chairmen say have been provided to the State Department.
“Those messages are also deeply relevant to this investigation and the impeachment inquiry,” said Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff.
The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, is also scheduled to testify behind closed doors this week. The chairmen did not say whether they know if she is also being instructed not to appear.
Sondland, a hotel executive who donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, had come under increased scrutiny after Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Ukraine, turned over text messages in his closed deposition last week that showed Sondland seeking to encourage Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
Democrats are trying to establish what leverage Trump used to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, now a political rival for the 2020 election.
But they have faced broad resistance from the Trump administration, as the president and his legal counsel push back on demands for documents and witness testimony. The administration’s blocking of Sondland from testifying represents the latest example of that.
Trump has responded furiously to the impeachment process, calling the probe a “scam” and a “witch hunt.” The president is scheduled to hold political rallies this week in Minnesota and Louisiana to offer his defense to his most passionate supporters.
The heart of the House inquiry is Trump’s suggestions this summer that he would withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine in return for looking into the Bidens. The committees are requesting testimony from State Department officials and others who may have helped Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, push Ukrainian officials to comply.
The Battles Ahead Over What Congress Demands on Trump: QuickTake
Trump’s July 25 call with Zelenskiy was initially revealed in a complaint filed by a intelligence community whistle-blower, whose identity remains unknown. That report details Sondland’s Kiev trip with Volker on July 26 -- a day after Trump’s call -- to meet “with President Zelenskiy and a variety of Ukrainian political figures.”
Less than an hour before Sondland’s deposition was supposed to begin on Tuesday, Robert Luskin, the attorney representing the ambassador, informed the committees that the State Department instructed his client not to appear.
“As the sitting U.S. ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the department’s direction,” Luskin said in a statement.
He said Sondland had agreed to appear willfully, not under subpoena, and “is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today,” but that “he stands ready to answer the committee’s questions fully and truthfully.”
Trump tweeted that he “would love” for Sondland to testify, “but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican’s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public” to see.
Schiff said committee staff spoke with the State Department late Monday, and there was no indication that Sondland’s deposition would be blocked.
“The failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents” could become part of a charge that the Trump administration is obstructing Congress, Schiff said.
Sondland’s testimony is a key part of the impeachment inquiry, given his role in the events that underpin the investigation. According to the whistle-blower complaint that sparked the process, “Ambassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to ‘navigate’ the demands that the president had made of Mr. Zelenskiy.”
The texts given to the committees last week also show that Sondland and another top American diplomat helped script a proposed announcement by Ukraine’s leader to say his government would investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. That announcement was never made.
The texts also show Sondland defending Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to look into the Bidens, even over concerns raised by the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, who warned against conditioning U.S. military assistance on an “investigation.”
“As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” wrote Taylor on Sept. 9.
Sondland replied that Trump isn’t seeking “a quid pro quo,” but wants to test Ukraine’s commitment to reform. He then suggested they stop texting and said Taylor should speak directly to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Trump referenced Sondland’s texted response in a tweet Tuesday morning.
Though Ukraine is not part of the European Union, the documents now made public show that Sondland played an central role in Trump’s efforts to persuade Ukraine leaders to carry out the investigations.
Some Democrats, including Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia, a member of the Oversight Committee, have called on Sondland to resign.
“These text messages are deeply troubling. Mr. Sondland has lost credibility and must resign,” said Connolly, in a statement.
Sondland’s blocked testimony comes after the lawyer for two other individuals -- Ukrainian born businessman Lev Parnes and his business partner Igor Fruman -- said on Monday they would, for now, put off a request to testify and turn over additional documents by Oct. 14. The committees are prepared to respond with subpoenas to force them to testify, according to a House official.
The House request is “overly broad and unduly burdensome” and “beyond the scope” of the inquiry, John Dowd, the lawyer representing Parnes and Fruman, wrote in an Oct. 3 letter to the House Intelligence Committee obtained by Bloomberg News.
Dowd previously represented Trump as a personal lawyer during the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election."

“Our focus is on borrowers and businesses that for one reason or another cannot access the traditional credit markets and they do not want private equity,” Alex Popov, head of Carlyle Credit Opportunities, said in an interview.
As competition rises in pockets of private credit, compressing yields, Carlyle is looking for overlooked opportunities ahead of a long-anticipated downturn. The company, which has $47 billion of credit assets under management, is hunting for borrowers less exposed to recessionary forces in sectors where others don’t lend, Popov said.
“The level of competition reduces very quickly,” he said. “The type of risk we see in this fund is really focused on complexity, lack of institutionalization and niche industries -- and those are not cyclical problems.”
The fund is looking to lend to more developed companies with at least $500 million of enterprise value. About 40% of the businesses the fund invests in have at least $1.5 billion of value, Popov said. These are often companies going through a transition such as those looking to expand, boost capital expenditures or buying out a legacy minority shareholder, he said.
Carlyle said in July its Credit Opportunities Fund had raked in $2.4 billion of equity commitments. At that point the fund had already invested in a founder-owned home builder and a publicly traded media company. This month the fund was one of three lenders to provide financing for AVALT’s purchase of home service company Ned Stevens.
That transaction is an example of how the fund wants to leverage Carlyle’s existing network of investment professionals. When the private equity group didn’t end up acquiring Ned Stevens it arranged an introduction, which led to the fund playing a part in the debt financing, Popov said.
Roughly 85% of the deals the fund has done so far have come through Carlyle’s proprietary channels.
“That network is very powerful in terms of sourcing opportunities,” Popov said.

A Q&A with Ed Stack, the steward and conscience of Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., about his new book.
Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. started as a single store in Binghamton, New York, catering to fishermen. In short order, the owner, Dick Stack, added hunting gear, including rifles. When Dick’s son Ed began working for his dad as a teenager, handling rifles was part of his job. Guns were second nature.
By his early 20s, Ed Stack was essentially running Dick’s (though his father remained the owner). Once he hit 30 and was fully in charge, he embarked on an expansion that’s never ended: Dick’s now has around 750 stores, which generated $8.5 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year.
For most of that time, guns were an important category for Dick’s. But the 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which took the lives of 20 children and seven adults, shook Stack to his core. He decided to pull assault rifles from Dick’s shelves, though he kept relatively quiet about the move.
Six years later, after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Stack was again moved to act. A smaller chain, an offshoot of Dick’s called Field & Stream, had continued to sell assault weapons. Out they went. Stack also announced that Dick’s would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and wouldn’t sell guns to anyone under 21. He did one other thing: He went public, granting several television interviews, inviting controversy he had previously avoided.
Stack is out with a new book, “It’s How We Play the Game.”


                1
            
         For the most part, it is a classic chief executive’s memoir, a tale of success with roadblocks along the way. But the last few chapters detail the difficult decisions he — and Dick’s — have made around guns these last few years. What follows is a lightly edited and condensed version of a conversation we had about guns late last week.
Joe Nocera: Do you still have guns in your stores?
Ed Stack: We got rid of the kind of guns that were used at Sandy Hook and Parkland. The guns we have today are really for hunting and clay and trap shooting. We did a test with 10 stores recently and eliminated the hunting department to see what would happen if we replaced it with merchandise that we thought would work better in those communities. And we were surprised at just how well those stores did. Earlier this year we took the hunting department out of another 125 stores to see how that would go. And we aren’t putting any firearms in new stores. There are now about 200 stores without any firearms. As we said in our last quarterly call, the whole category is under strategic review.
JN: For most of your career, selling guns was a given. Did the popularity of assault weapons give you pause?
ES: I never liked the idea of those guns, and we didn’t put them in. Then they were banned from 1994 to 2004. When the ban expired, I still resisted putting them in. We finally started stocking them maybe 12 to 18 months before Sandy Hook. And when Sandy Hook happened, I said, “We’re done.” We took them out of the Dick’s stores. We said we were suspending the sale of modern sporting rifles.
            

                2
            
        But we never put them back in.
JN: A lot of people were galvanized by Newtown but their passion eventually faded until Parkland. Did that happen with you?
ES: For me, it never went away. After Sandy Hook, we worked for several years on a concept called Field & Stream, which was a specialty hunt, fish, and camp store. We had a lot of debate about whether we were going to put those weapons in those stores. I reluctantly agreed to do it because if we didn’t we wouldn’t be credible in that space. Whenever there was a shooting, whether San Bernardino or the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, it would weigh on me. To the point where we said, we shouldn’t advertise these guns anymore. Then came Parkland. That’s the point where I said, “We’re done. We’re going to stand up and talk about this.” We thought we were in a position to do that as one of the largest firearms dealers in the country.
JN: Obviously, you had to know you were going to take a financial hit once you stopped selling assault weapons. How did you think about your responsibility to shareholders versus your responsibility to society?
ES: Once we knew what we were going to do, our CFO said we needed to figure out the financial ramifications so we could inform Wall Street. I said, “You’re right we need to do that. But I don’t care what it is, we are going to do this anyway.” We told the Street we would likely take a $250 million hit, and that’s pretty close to what it was. You talk about the shareholders. My family and I are the largest shareholders, and we control the vote. We felt this was the right thing to do for the community and we thought it was the right thing to do for the company long term. Maybe not short term, but long term.
JN: How did Wall Street react?
ES: We never had a major shareholder saying what you’re doing is crazy. But we also never had any of the so-called socially responsible investors call and say I’m buying your stock because of what you did.
JN: It’s well-known that you got a lot of blowback from customers who felt you were trampling on the Second Amendment. What other kind of resistance did you get?
ES: The ones who were really upset with us were the firearm brands. A number of them cut us off. I invited all the gun manufacturers to a meeting. Only a few came. A couple of them sent notes saying I’m not coming and what’s more I’m not going to sell to you anymore.
JN: Have you ever talked to any of the people trying to develop so-called smart guns, which can only be used by their owners?
ES: I think the idea of a smart gun is great. I’ve told a couple of the people who are working on them if you bring it to market, and we think the technology has been perfected, we’ll stock them. If we’re still in the gun business, that is.

Subscribe via Pocket Cast or  iTunes.
These days, you’d be hard-pressed to find many people in Washington who are all that worried about the U.S. budget deficit. Republicans seem more interested in tax cuts, Democrats have ambitious spending plans for everything from health care to infrastructure, and Modern Monetary Theory, a manifesto for free-spending governments, is all the rage in progressive circles.
But on Wall Street, bond dealers provided a small, but pointed reminder that, just maybe, debt and deficits do matter after all.
It came in the form of a sudden spike in interest rates for repurchase agreements, or repos, a normally obscure part of finance that keeps the global capital markets spinning. Plenty of factors helped cause liquidity to dry up, but one that’s getting more attention is concern that dealers are starting to choke on Treasuries as the U.S. government goes deeper into the red.
The argument goes like this: Primary dealers, which are obligated to bid at U.S. debt auctions, have absorbed more and more Treasuries to finance the Trump administration’s tax cuts as investor demand has waned. Typically, they rely on repos to fund those purchases by putting up the debt as collateral.
The problem is that with the financial system already inundated by over $16 trillion of Treasuries, banks constrained by crisis-era rules have fewer incentives to participate in repo. Simply put, there was too much new debt flooding the financial system and not enough money, causing lenders to jack up repo rates. The Federal Reserve has moved to inject much-needed cash on a temporary basis, but if left unchecked, the flood of supply in coming months and years could ultimately result in higher borrowing costs for the U.S.
“There’s no down time on the supply front,” said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial who’s been following debt markets for over three decades.
The Treasury’s next slate of debt sales comes this week, with a combined $78 billion of 3-, 10- and 30-year auctions starting Tuesday. Yields on the benchmark 10-year note are currently at 1.52%.
Of course, supply wasn’t the only issue. The situation was compounded by corporate tax payments that also siphoned cash out of the banking system.
And to be fair, nobody is suggesting the U.S. faces any imminent problems financing itself. Everywhere you look, government borrowing costs in bond markets around the world are at historic lows. The dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, and with the global economy showing signs of weakness, investors are still likely turn to Treasuries for safe harbor.
Economists Worry That MMT Is Winning the Argument in Washington
Nevertheless, the mid-September repo upheaval is a clear sign there might actually be limits on just how much debt the U.S. can take before triggering more frequent disruptions. Deficits aren’t exactly new, but they do add up. Since the crisis, the market for Treasury debt has roughly tripled in size.
And the fiscal balance has only gotten worse under President Donald Trump. The deficit surpassed $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, which just ended last month. And the Congressional Budget Office forecasts the shortfall this fiscal year will exceed $1 trillion. That all means the Treasury will need to keep increasing its debt auctions to fund the budget shortfalls.
In the coming decade, debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product will reach 100%, CBO estimates show. That would be greater than any time since just after World War II. Before the financial crisis, debt-to-GDP was about 40%.
The Repo Market’s a Mess. (What’s the Repo Market?): QuickTake
The growth was more than manageable in the years after the crisis because the Fed bought significant amounts of Treasuries (from dealers post-auction) with its quantitative easing, or QE. Some argue the Fed used QE to “monetize” the debt, which pumped trillions of dollars worth of cheap cash into the banking system and kept U.S. funding costs artificially low. Whatever the case, there’s little doubt the buying helped dealers clear their inventories.
That started to change in late 2017, when the Fed began to gradually unwind those purchases, reduce the size of its balance sheet and drain the excess cash held in bank reserves. The Fed now holds roughly $3.9 trillion in assets, down from $4.5 trillion in January 2015. More than half of the total is in Treasuries.
Without the Fed, which was arguably the biggest buyer of U.S. debt during the QE era, dealers have had to pick up the slack. In May, primary dealers’ outright positions in Treasuries reached an all-time high of almost $300 billion -- more than double what they were the previous year.
What’s more, post-crisis rules have led banks to prefer cash over Treasuries, which contributed to the liquidity issues in repo markets, according to Michael de Pass, head of Treasuries trading at Citadel Securities.
“The Fed has shrunk its balance sheet in a meaningful way, resulting in reduced reserves in the system,” he said. The cash squeeze has “been further exacerbated by increased issuance, resulting in high levels of Treasury collateral settling into the market.”
Dealers aren’t getting as much help from foreign investors to soak up all that additional supply. Big creditors like China and Japan have slowed their buying of Treasuries in recent years. Overall, the share of foreign official holdings has shrunk to just over 25% this year, from a high of about 40% in 2008.
That waning appetite been reflected in the amount of bids investors submit versus the actual amount sold, known as the bid-to-cover ratio.
According to an analysis by John Canavan, Oxford Economics’ lead analyst, the ratio for 3-, 10- and 30-year debt sold each month has fallen to 2.39. That’s down from 2.89 times in January 2018, just before the Treasury began boosting its sales, and far lower than a high of 3.48 times in December 2011.
So-called auction tails, which occur when yields on debt issued at auction exceed prevailing levels in the market at the time of sale, have become more common as well. In layman’s terms, it’s a sign investors need to be paid more to take on new debt. That’s been true especially for longer-maturity debt, like the 10-year note and the 30-year bond.
“The debt has become more difficult to digest as the rise in Treasury issuance is outpacing the rise in demand, and overall there’s been a decline in recent years in foreign demand,” Canavan said.
There’s little to suggest the U.S. will suddenly decide to embrace fiscal restraint, either under Trump or a Democratic administration.
So for many market watchers, the most likely near-term solution to the supply problem is for the Fed to start increasing its debt purchases in a systematic way once more. (Following the recent repo turmoil, the Fed has been providing repo financing on a temporary basis.)
Historically, pumping lots of cash into the system has come with the risk of spurring too much inflationary pressure. But after a decade of ultra-low inflation, that isn’t much of a concern today. The purchases would not only replenish bank reserves and help dealers off-load Treasury collateral, but it would also keep a lid on funding costs as the U.S. runs up the deficit.
Former Fed officials Joseph Gagnon and Brian Sack say the central bank should buy enough Treasuries to build up a buffer of extra reserves, with outright purchases totaling $250 billion over the next two quarters.
“More Fed buying may finally give some relief to the supply issues that the market so needs,” Vogel said.
When it comes to financing America’s deficit though, it’s not the Fed that Julius Baer’s Markus Allenspach is worried about.
“There’s going to be saturation by investors at some point,” said Allenspach, head of fixed-income research and a member of the firm’s investment committee. “Yes, there is a global search for yield, but we believe we may be past the peak of this hunt for safe assets.”

The acquisition of North American Palladium Ltd. is partly a bet on platinum’s sister metal palladium continuing to rally, while Implats Chief Executive Officer Nico Muller has also stressed the appeal of a relatively quick payback from low-cost, mechanized assets. However, the deal is also a geopolitical play as the Johannesburg-based miner seeks to balance exposure to its more volatile home region.
“The diversification into North America provides a hedge against some of the socio-economic, political and structural risks the company faces in South Africa and Zimbabwe,” said Christopher Nicholson, an analyst at RMB Morgan Stanley.
The transaction comes three years after Sibanye Gold Ltd. bought Montana-based Stillwater Mining Co., but Implats’s first deal outside southern Africa also echoes trends in the country’s gold industry. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. is selling its last remaining South African assets as it turns its back on deep-level mines in favor of more profitable deposits in West Africa, Australia and South America.
While South Africa’s platinum operations are far more robust than the nation’s gold mines, and Implats returned to profit this year on the back of record palladium prices and a weaker rand, its decision highlights some of the wider industry challenges.
Anglo American Plc CEO Mark Cutifani last week said there are no shortage of geological opportunities in South Africa, but to attract investment requires political stability and regulatory clarity. The “parlous state” of public finances also remains a challenge, he said, adding that miners must work with the government to tackle unresolved issues in the nation’s Mining Charter, which seeks to address inequalities resulting from apartheid.
“There are many other factors besides mineral endowment that influence where investors decide to put their money, all of which drive reassurance to investors about the security of their investment over time,” Cutifani said.
While Implats had investment options in South Africa, the longer payback period involved in building a new mine was a deterrent.
“If you want exposure to a producing asset, you would have to look at North America or Russia,” said Mandi Dungwa, an analyst at Kagiso Asset Management in Cape Town. “If you are trying to reduce risk, Canada is a very attractive mining jurisdiction compared to some of the issues we have here.”
Anglo American Platinum Ltd. CEO Chris Griffith said last week that South Africa’s government needs to resolve the issue of community disruptions around mines, which is leading to huge losses for producers. Labor disputes, crime and xenophobia are deterring investors, while policy differences between government and ruling African National Congress are also a concern, he said.
Sibanye, which became the largest platinum miner after acquiring Lonmin Plc earlier this year, may move its primary listing from South Africa because of increasing uncertainty, CEO Neal Froneman said in March.
Geographical diversification is a secondary consideration, but has its advantages, said Implats CEO Muller. That includes the absence of power cuts, which have plagued South African industry as state-owned utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. struggled to meet demand.
“We don’t have exposure to Eskom that side, there is lower risk associated with availability of cheap water and of course we are to a large extent shielded from the economic crisis we are experiencing in Zimbabwe,” Muller said.
Despite the challenges in southern Africa, not everyone is convinced by Implats’s overseas venture.
The deal could prove costly should palladium prices fall, according to Johann Steyn, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. Steyn said Implats could have bought Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. to exploit synergies from mines adjacent to its own Rustenburg operations.
“If we are correct in our forecast that palladium will revert back to a long-term average of $850 an ounce, then this deal could turn out to be value destructive,” Steyn said. “If it holds, then a lot of value will be created.”
Palladium traded at about $1,645 an ounce as of 2:11 p.m. in London, after climbing to a record of $1,701.93 last week. Implats has almost tripled in value this year, making it the best performer on the Johannesburg stock exchange. The shares were up 0.2% on Tuesday.
While Implats CEO Muller said the profitability of NAP will help the company reinstate dividends, it should have prioritized making payouts, according to Rene Hochreiter, an analyst at Noah Capital Markets Ltd.
“Maybe there aren’t many assets out there, but I would have spent the money on something better,” Hochreiter said. “It’s time for them to start paying dividends instead of blowing the money on expensive acquisitions.”

Standard General LP, the hedge fund that once sold a collection of newspapers to Warren Buffett, is back in the media business with a stake in TV broadcaster Tegna Inc. and is on the hunt for a deal.
The fund’s last big television investment was in Media General, acquired by Nexstar Media Group Inc. for $4.6 billion in 2017. Now Standard General wants to bring that experience to bear by taking an activist role at Tegna, Chief Investment Officer Soo Kim said in an interview. Last week, Standard General disclosed a 9.8% stake in Tegna, which owns 64 local TV stations and four radio stations in the U.S., in 51 markets.
Tegna has already drawn the interest of private equity behemoth Apollo Management, which is in the process of wrapping up another deal to acquire 13 stations from Cox Enterprises Inc. Apollo told Tegna it was willing to do both TV deals simultaneously and could pay a premium based on the broadcaster’s 52-week high, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tegna rebuffed Apollo’s approach, which the company revealed consisted of a letter of interest in February that did not specify a price and a different proposal for a combination with Cox in June. Tegna traded above $14 in February 2018 and then fell as low as $10.09 before climbing again in mid-2019, reaching as high as $16.44.
“Standard General has a successful track record of actively working with publicly-listed television broadcasting companies,” said Kim, managing partner and chief investment officer at Standard General. “In our role as significant shareholders and directors of companies in the sector, which has included significant expertise in M&A, we have created considerable value for investors.”
If Tegna doesn’t work with Standard General to explore deals, it could face a tense situation with its new top investor. Standard General prefers to work closely with management teams, though it also has a history of seeking board representation when it’s a major shareholder.
Tegna’s management has met with Standard General in recent weeks and will do so again soon, people familiar with the matter said. The broadcaster didn’t receive an exact offer price from Apollo in writing, one of the people said.
Kim, who co-founded Standard General in 2007 after working at Bankers Trust, Och-Ziff Capital Managment, and starting Cyrus Capital Partners, has been on the board of a number of TV station firms. Starting with an investment in Young Broadcasting, a $300 million company in bankruptcy, the hedge fund helped steer a string of mergers with Media General, LIN Media, an aborted one with Meredith Corp and finally with Nexstar.
Over the past five years, Standard General has generated an annualized net return of 5%, compared with 3% for the HFR Event-Driven Special Situation Index, according to a person familiar with the matter. There have been learning experiences along the way -- the firm was involved in the ill-fated attempt to help American Apparel Inc. founder Dov Charney boost his stake in the company, which later filed for bankruptcy. And Standard General unsuccessfully tried to revive the RadioShack chain by acquiring its brand and hundreds of stores out of bankruptcy.
Standard General isn’t the typical activist investor. Rather, the hedge fund takes large ownership stakes -- it had 50% control of Young Broadcasting at one point -- and uses them to take board seats and direct management. Besides its position in Tegna, Standard General currently holds 20% of National CineMedia Inc, according to Bloomberg data. National CineMedia agreed to give Standard General two board seats.
“Tegna’s board and management team value input from our shareholders and welcome a dialogue with all shareholders,” Tegna said in a statement. “Our board of directors regularly evaluates opportunities to drive value and is committed to acting in the best long-term interests of all of our shareholders.”
The roadmap for successful TV broadcasting mergers may have become more challenging, however, after a federal appeals court rejected changes that the Federal Communications Commission made to media ownership rules. The decision could narrow the potential universe of acquirers. Apollo also is awaiting regulatory approval for its leveraged buyout of Cox TV stations.
The media ownership restrictions could give Tegna a path to acquire assets rather than sell them, since competitors including Cox and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. are tied up in other deals.
Standard General has a non-controlling stake in a smaller broadcasting business, Standard Media Group, which owns a couple of TV stations in Rhode Island and Nebraska. The company tried to acquire nine stations from Sinclair in 2018, but the deal fell through after Sinclair’s acquisition of Tribune Media Co. fell apart.
Representatives for Apollo declined to comment.
“As the single largest active shareholder of Tegna, we are looking forward to a constructive dialogue with the management team, and to leveraging our experience to secure the best possible outcome for the company,” Kim said.

Over three-quarters of survey participants expect concerted easing from the People’s Bank of China. Authorities have so far refrained from large-scale stimulus, which could hinder their efforts to reduce financial leverage.
Investors see the PBOC’s one-year medium lending facility rate, paid by commercial banks borrowing from the central bank, being trimmed to 3.1% by year-end from 3.3% currently, based on an average of 19 respondents. And the required reserve ratio for major banks, or the share of funds lenders must hold in reserve, will be reduced to 12% from 13%, according to the average of 25 respondents.

Three-quarters of the survey participants expect Brazil’s pension-reform bill to be approved this year, seen as a key move toward fiscal discipline in Latin America’s largest economy. Upside to Brazilian bonds may be limited given the powerful rally they have seen in recent quarters, however, analysts say. Central bank rate cuts have also already boosted Brazilian debt.

Will South Africa hold on to its sole investment-grade rating from Moody’s in 2019?
Most respondents expect the investment grade rating from Moody's to be maintained 
Source: Bloomberg survey of 54 investors, traders and strategists 

A majority of those surveyed expect the country to stay out of junk territory in the assessment of Moody’s Investor Service. That’s despite financial markets pricing in a downgrade for months. Both the S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings cut their assessments to junk in 2017. Moody’s, which rates South Africa at the lowest investment grade, but with a stable outlook, is scheduled to make its assessment on Nov. 1.
Seen as crucial to the judgment: South Africa’s plan for troubled state-owned utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which saw its stand-alone rating lowered deeper into junk by Fitch on Oct. 1. Underlying these fiscal issues are South Africa’s growth concerns, with the economy having entered its 70th month of a weakening cycle in September.
With U.S. rates having a strong bearing on emerging-market assets, is the 10-year Treasury yield more likely to rise above 2.4% or fall below 1.4% by the end of 2019?

Source: Bloomberg survey of 54 investors, traders and strategists 

Over three-quarters of survey participants expect the benchmark to end the year lower than the current 1.53%, possibly below 1.40%. The yield has dropped more than a percentage point this year.
Emerging-market debt has been a beneficiary of lower U.S. rates -- in particular, dollar-denominated bonds. The hard-currency debt has outperformed local-currency bonds so far this year, in part due to a strengthening dollar.

The fact that Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is set to appear for his private deposition is the next step for the panels leading the probe, after difficulties scheduling other requested testimonies. Lawmakers will be testing Sondland’s willingness to offer clear answers and his loyalty to Trump.
Sondland, a hotel executive who donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, came under increased scrutiny last week after Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, turned over text messages in his closed deposition that showed Sondland seeking to encourage Ukrainian officials to agree to “the deliverable.”
To get to the bottom of that request, Democrats are trying to establish what leverage Trump used to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, now a political rival for the 2020 election. They have faced broad resistance from the Trump administration, as the president and his legal counsel reject demands for documents and witness testimony.
Trump has responded furiously to the impeachment process, calling the inquiry a “scam” and a “witch hunt.” He will hold political rallies this week in Minnesota and Louisiana, and will likely offer his own defense to his most passionate supporters.
Earlier: U.S. Diplomats Tried to Ghostwrite Ukraine Pledge on Biden Probe
The heart of the House inquiry, led by the committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight, is the accusation that Trump sought to use U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get that country to pursue probes, including one against the Bidens, The committees are requesting testimony from State Department officials and others who may have helped Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, push Ukrainian officials to comply.
The contents of Trump’s July 25 call with Zelenskiy was initially revealed in a complaint filed by a intelligence community whistle-blower, whose identity remains unknown. That report details Sondland’s trip to Kyiv with Volker on July 26 -- a day after Trump’s call -- to meet “with President Zelenskiy and a variety of Ukrainian political figures.”
According to the whistle-blower’s complaint, “Ambassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to ‘navigate’ the demands that the president had made of Mr. Zelenskiy.”
The texts given to the committees last week also show that Sondland and another top American diplomat helped script a proposed announcement by Ukraine’s leader to say his government would investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. That announcement was never made.
Who’s Who: The Americans at the Center of Trump’s Ukraine Gambit
The texts also show Sondland defending Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to look into the Bidens, even over concerns raised by the top American diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, who warned against conditioning U.S. military assistance on an “investigation.”
“As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Taylor wrote on Sept. 9.
Sondland replied that Trump isn’t seeking “a quid pro quo,” but wanted to test Ukraine’s commitment to reform. He then suggested they stop texting and said Taylor should speak directly to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.
Though Ukraine is not part of the European Union, the documents now made public show that Sondland, the ambassador to the E.U., played a central role in Trump’s efforts to convince Ukrainian leaders to carry out the investigations.
Some Democrats, including Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia, a Democratic member of the Oversight Committee, say Sondland should resign.
“These text messages are deeply troubling. Mr. Sondland has lost credibility and must resign,” said Connolly, in a statement.
Sondland’s testimony comes after the lawyer for two Giuliani associates -- Ukrainian-born businessman Lev Parnes and his business partner Igor Fruman -- said on Monday they would, for now, put off a request to testify and turn over additional documents by Oct. 14. The committees are prepared to respond with subpoenas to force them to testify, according to a House official.
The House request is “overly broad and unduly burdensome” and “beyond the scope” of the inquiry, John Dowd, the lawyer representing Parnes and Fruman, wrote in an Oct. 3 letter to the House Intelligence Committee obtained by Bloomberg News.
Dowd said lawyers need time to review the documents for material that should instead be withheld under legal privileges. He asked the committees to amend their requests and said he would keep them advised about a “rolling production of non-privileged documents.”
Dowd previously represented Trump as a personal lawyer during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Dowd said the committees’ deadline for responses, which he said were made in a Sept. 30 letter, led him to believe the Democratic leaders of the panels want “to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.”
At least one other witness, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, is scheduled to testify on Friday.
The leaders of the three committees, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings on Monday subpoenaed the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget for documents related to “the reasons behind the White House’s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress.” That subpoena requires a response by Oct. 15.

Michelin handed out a record number of stars to a total 187 establishments in its new 2020 guide—including three stars for a quirky French restaurant in London.
The Lecture Room & Library at Sketch, the U.K.’s newest three-star dining room.
A record number of U.K. and Ireland restaurants were awarded Michelin stars at a ceremony in London on Monday night, including the ultimate accolade of three stars for the Lecture Room & Library at Sketch, a French spot in Mayfair co-owned by Paris-based chef Pierre Gagnaire. 
A total of 187 establishments feature in the guide for 2020, including four new two-stars and 23 one-stars.
Sketch becomes one of only five restaurants in the U.K. to hold three stars. The flagship Lecture Room is known for quirky and creative dishes such as hand-collected Scottish scallops with pear, celeriac, and shiso, served with turmeric butter and quinoa. The Grand Dessert features seven miniature plates in two servings. The seven-course tasting menu costs £120 ($148), with a vegetarian option.
The décor at Sketch, a London town house with a total of four restaurants and bars, is even more unusual than the food, with huge egg-shaped loos a particular favorite on Instagram. Sketch is co-owned by Gagnaire, who holds three Michelin stars at his eponymous restaurant in Paris, and by the restaurateur Mourad Mazouz, who has establishments in Paris and London.
Three restaurants were promoted to two stars from one: La Dame de Pic, in London; the Dining Room at Whatley Manor, in Malmesbury, England; and the Greenhouse, in Dublin. Aimsir, a restaurant that opened just this year in Celbridge, Ireland, went straight to two stars. Four restaurants in London gained their first stars: Endo at the Rotunda; Dysart Petersham; Da Terra; and Mãos.
“Despite the obvious challenges being faced by the industry here in the U.K., we are thrilled that this has been such a stellar year, and we have seen many first ventures opening and rapidly rising to success,” said Gwendal Poullennec, international director of the guides. 
On the downside, three London restaurants lost their single stars: Benares, Galvin at Windows, and Yauatcha Soho. The Araki lost all three of its stars after chef Mitsuhiro Araki returned to Japan.
The Michelin awards attract considerable criticism, including that they’re unpredictable and often appear inconsistent. But chefs are obsessed with the awards, and getting in or moving up the rankings amounts to considerable money in bookings. Little else is talked about in kitchens before the announcement. This year there’d been widespread speculation that two other London restaurants might be promoted to three stars: Claude Bosi at Bibendum and Core by Clare Smyth. There was also a notable shortage of women winning new stars. The sole beneficiary was Anne-Sophie Pic, who’s based in France.
Michelin has done a reasonable job this year in recognizing young talent, particularly in Ireland, where two restaurants achieved two-star status: the Greenhouse (Dublin) and Aimsir, in County Kildare, about a 30-minute drive west from the capital. But other respected young chefs were ignored, including the popular Tom Brown at Cornerstone in east London.
No one predicted a third star for Sketch, which won its first star in 2005 and the second in 2012. I’ve long been a fan of the place, but I have no idea why this was the year, though it does deserve it. My best meals in London in the past 12 months have been at Claude Bosi at Bibendum, and it’s very disappointing that Bosi didn’t win his third star.
(The other restaurants earning three stars were Gordon Ramsay and Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester, both in London; and the Fat Duck and the Waterside Inn, both in the village of Bray.)
Brexit, which in London is even more of an obsession than food, has had only a limited impact on high-end restaurants. While it has made it more difficult to hire the European staff on which the U.K. hospitality industry depends, the decline in the value of the pound has made restaurants more affordable for overseas visitors.
The awards were announced at the Hurlingham Club, in a slow and overlong ceremony attended by star chefs from across the U.K. 
Three stars are given for “exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey,” Michelin says. “Our highest award is given for the superlative cooking of chefs at the peak of their profession.” Two stars represent “excellent cooking, worth a detour.” One star is for “high-quality cooking, worth a stop.” A Bib Gourmand represents more value-driven restaurants, where diners can get three courses for £28 or less, but not quite at the level of a star.

Rwanda is questioning suspects to try and establish why militants staged a rare attack in its northern mountainous region known for gorilla trekking, one of the nation’s main tourist attractions.
At least 14 people where killed in the Friday attack in Musanze district, about 58 miles northwest of the capital, Kigali. Nineteen of the attackers were killed and five arrested, according to the National Police. The militants are members of Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda or FDLR, a rebel group based in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, the police said.
“We are interrogating the suspects at the moment to establish what their motive was,” police spokesman John Bosco Kabera said Monday by phone. “We don’t know what exactly motivated them.” 
Rwanda’s economy is among Africa’s fastest-growing, partly driven by its tourism sector that President Paul Kagame helped build as part of a recovery programme after the genocide in 1994. The nation started an airline, built a convention center and hotels, signed a sponsorship deal with English Premier League soccer team Arsenal and is constructing a new airport in bid to boost tourism as a step to attaining middle-income status by 2035.
Rwanda Says Four Gunmen Killed in Battle With Congo-Based Rebels
All visitors to Volcanoes National Park in the region, “were and continue to be safe,” state-run Rwanda Development Board said in a statement. Thousands of guests have visited the park over the past two decades and there have been no security incidents, according to the statement.
There are fewer than 1,000 mountain gorillas left in the world and the primates can only be found around the border of Rwanda, Uganda and DRC, and in Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Rwanda is monitoring 329 of the primates in its territory, its tourism agency said in August. 
Security has been restored in the area and the hunt for the attackers continues, the police said in a statement on its Twitter account earlier.
The FDLR, which is accused of participating in the genocide 25 years ago, remains active but there haven’t been any reports of a raid by the group on Rwandan soil this year.

Years of loyalty to Donald Trump are no guarantee he’ll return the favor. Just ask Rick Perry.
As an impeachment probe grows, Trump has offered a range of explanations for his July conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which spawned a whistle-blower complaint. The latest is that he only made the call at the behest of his energy secretary, one of Trump’s original cabinet stalwarts who is now said to be planning his departure.
The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Trump told Republican lawmakers in a phone call Friday that it was Perry who’d urged him to call Zelenskiy, an official familiar with the call said. Trump’s remarks were first reported by Axios, and were enough to get #RickPerryMadeMe trending on Twitter. Perry’s spokeswoman confirmed that the secretary urged Trump to make a call to the new Ukrainian leader to discuss energy issues.
But there’s no indication Perry urged Trump to withhold military aid, float an investigation of Joe Biden, or kick off a hunt for emails related to the 2016 presidential race.
Trump’s comment thrust Perry into the spotlight. Perry has met at least three times with Zelenskiy, including in May when he led a delegation to the new leader’s inauguration in place of Vice President Mike Pence. That trip was referenced in the whistle-blower complaint that sparked the House’s swift-moving impeachment inquiry.
While there, Perry announced the Trump administration supported sanctions against companies helping to construct Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which links Russia to Germany while bypassing Ukraine.
The U.S. has long viewed its abundant natural gas -- as well as coal and oil -- as a potent diplomatic weapon to curtail Russia’s sway over Ukraine, which has long been beholden to Russia for much of its natural resources.
In remarks to reporters in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius Monday, where Perry is meeting with officials from Central and Eastern Europe, Perry said said he had repeatedly asked Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader about its energy independence.
“Absolutely. I asked the president multiple times: ‘Mr. President we think it is in the United States’ and Ukraine’s best interest that you and the president of Ukraine have conversations that you discuss the options that are there,” Perry said. “That was the message day in and day out.”
According to the memorandum summary released by the White House, Zelenskiy alluded to “energy independence” during his call with Trump yet Trump didn’t mention energy.
Trump has offered several explanations to either describe the call as harmless, or to even distance himself from it. He’s said the conversation was “perfect,” said it was about corruption generally, attacked the whistle-blower account largely corroborated by a call summary Trump himself released, and doubled down last week by publicly asking Ukraine and China to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.
Perry may be called to testify in the impeachment probe, Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin said last week. Perry has said he would cooperate with House Democrats curious about his role.
Perry wasn’t on the July 25 phone call, according to an Energy Department spokeswoman, and Perry told the Christian Broadcast Network that he never heard anyone from the White House bring up the Bidens.
“Not once, as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name -- not the former vice president, not his son -- ever mentioned,” Perry told CBN.
New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is also seeking more details about Perry’s role in dealing with Zelenskiy, including why he was tapped to lead the delegation to his inauguration instead of Pence.
“President Trump’s phone call and the allegations in the whistle-blower complaint raise serious questions about the messages that were communicated on behalf of President Trump to the government of Ukraine,” Menendez wrote in a letter to Perry.
The secretary went to Lithuania for discussions with two dozen European “energy leaders,” including Ukraine, energy department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said.
Perry, an Air Force veteran who was previously Texas’s longest serving governor, has been in Trump’s cabinet since 2017. He’s said to enjoy a good rapport with the president, having avoided the missteps that led to the downfall of other figures in the administration. Perry has earnestly carried out Trump’s priorities, such as a thus-far-unsuccessful bid to subsidize unprofitable coal and nuclear plants.
Perry has told confidants that he plans to resign from the administration by the end of the year, according to two people familiar with the matter. He’d been contemplating an exit long before the Ukraine controversy erupted. Perry is said to have been paving a path for his likely successor, Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
Speaking in Lithuania, Perry downplayed reports he would be departing, saying of his departure, “it’s not today, it’s not tomorrow, not next month.”
“I’m here. I’m serving,” Perry said. “They’ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now. One of these days they will probably get it right.”

Emerging markets have rarely been so torn between trade-war tensions and optimism central banks will keep up their stimulus efforts, suggesting a week of greater-than-normal price swings is in prospect.
The U.S. and China are set to restart high-level trade negotiations in Washington on Thursday and Friday, with investors skeptical of a breakthrough as President Donald Trump battles Congress over its impeachment inquiry. Before that, all eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday as investors seek clues on whether the central bank will enact a third-straight reduction in interest rates later this month. Signs that the world’s biggest economy is slowing weighed on developing-nation stocks for a third week, while currencies strengthened as the dollar wobbled.
Chinese officials are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the discussions. While China plans to make an offer, it won’t include commitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy or the government subsidies that have been the target of longstanding U.S. complaints, one of the people said.
Emerging-Market Yield Hunt Will Trump Trade Wars for Now: Survey
“Trump may push to announce some sort of progress, given weaker markets and economy, but I doubt it will have much substance,” said Peter Kisler, a money manager at North Asset Management LLP in London. “We continue to be relatively bearish emerging-markets credit, although foreign exchange doesn’t look too bad.”

Traders will also take their cue from China’s yuan fixing when the country’s markets re-open on Tuesday after a one-week holiday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. remains negative on the currency in the near term as it expects U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to be increased on Oct. 15. It’s also doubtful of a comprehensive trade agreement before the 2020 U.S. election.
While implied volatility for emerging-market currencies is near a two-month low, technical indicators suggest the calm may be about to end. The 50-day moving average is close to crossing above its 200-day measure. The last time that happened, in February 2018, it heralded a spike in volatility to a 2 1/2-year high in September that year.

Those are the main findings of Bloomberg’s quarterly survey of 54 global investors, strategists and traders on their outlook for developing-nation assets.
The trade dispute between the U.S. and China remains a key concern, with new round of negotiation due this week. But looser monetary policy among major central banks will still push investors toward riskier assets over the rest of the year, according to the survey. Stocks and bonds in Asia have the brightest prospects, while the Brazilian real and Russian ruble were the top picks for currencies. Argentina was the least-favored nation for all asset classes.
“The direction of global growth is pointing downward and that’s a negative for risk assets,” said Satoru Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based fund manager at Asset Management One Co., which oversees about $500 billion. “But we all have to find higher yields somewhere.”

After the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates for a second time this year in mid-September, emerging-market watchers shifted their focus to the trade war. The imposition of tariffs has hit growth in emerging markets, prompting authorities into action to contain the fallout. The World Trade Organization reduced its global trade-growth forecast for 2019 to the weakest level in a decade, while the International Monetary Fund expects a more significant economic slowdown than it did three months ago.

In fact, they’re doing neither.
While the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the broader benchmark for the asset class, is little changed since May, two groups of stocks within the gauge are diverging in performance. So-called value stocks -- mature companies with steady cash flows -- are underperforming growth stocks -- upstarts with business potential but weak balance sheets.
The MSCI EM Value Index has declined 4.4% since May, compared with a 4% gain for the MSCI EM Growth Index. That has taken the ratio between them to a 15-month low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This setback for value stocks ceases to be surprising when individual equity performances are considered. Most of the decline in the MSCI benchmark gauge since May has come from banks that are established and mature.
Ten financial institutions are among the 15 worst stocks on the index. One country stands out: India.
India’s banking industry has been caught in turmoil over souring loans, with the crisis first emanating from the less-regulated non-bank financial companies such as IL&FS Group. Since then, more institutions have come under investor scrutiny, including IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank. Even healthier financial companies have declined in the Mumbai market because of the slump in sentiment and a domestic slowdown.

Five of the 10 worst-performing financial companies on the MSCI index since May are from India.

Brazil’s record-low interest rate is putting the economy in uncharted territory, promising to reshape everything from the real estate market to the investment landscape.
After the recent reductions by the central bank, the country’s benchmark interest rate now stands at 5.5%, almost a third of the 14.25% level of 2016. Banks such as Banco Santander are wagering that it can fall as much as an additional percentage point by the end of this year, given dormant inflation and weak growth.
While activity is taking longer than expected to react to what seems to be a longer period of low rates, here’s where the borrowing cost cuts are having the biggest real-life impact in Latin America’s largest economy:
Mortgage loans are one of the credit lines most directly affected by monetary easing for a simple reason: almost 70% of those are provided by state-owned lender Caixa Economica Federal, at subsidized rates. In the year through August, those loans grew almost 13% compared to the same period in 2018, more than double the pace of overall lending. Average annual rates on mortgages are hovering around 8%, one of the cheapest available to consumers. A two percentage point drop in the benchmark rate gives 500,000 families per year the opportunity to buy their first house, according to Rubens Menin, the billionaire founder of Brazilian homebuilder MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA.

The combination of subdued inflation and record-low rates is also easing Brazil’s debt burden. In the year through July, interest payment on government debt amounted to roughly 5% of the gross domestic product, down almost half from the end of 2015. That happens because most of federal debt is indexed either to inflation or the key rate. “One takes after the other, and they both make the debt cheaper to service,” said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset Management. The improvement is limited by the fact the government continues to spend more than it takes in from tax income, increasing its stockpile of debt.
Companies are one of the biggest winners of lower borrowing costs, according to Thais Zara, the chief economist at Rosenberg Consultores Associados. Declines in the interest rate curve and credit default swaps usually lead to cheaper long-term financing through capital markets, opening up a window for firms to sell shares or bonds at a time of heightened demand for yield. In the year through August, the amount of debentures issued in the local market reached 117.4 billion reais ($28.9 billion), up 7.3% from the same period in 2018, according to capital markets association Anbima. That growth puts it on track to break last year’s record of 153.7 billion reais.
The hunt for yield has reshaped not just corporate balance sheets, but also the entire investment landscape. Keeping money in savings accounts or parked in government notes becomes less attractive as returns at 5.5% hardly compare to the 14.25% of just three years ago. Brazilians have pulled almost 15 billion reais this year through August from the traditional savings accounts, known locally as poupança, and poured more than 660 billion reais into funds, according to the country’s capital markets association. Stocks and exchange traded funds are in the spotlight this year, leading the inflows.
The shift away from the plain vanilla fixed income strategy has also caused a massive change in the profile of a Brazilian investor. Entire teams have left banks to start hedge funds, which have multiplied as easy returns fade and products previously only available to wealthy individuals become more widely accessible. The number of retail investors at local stock exchange B3 SA crossed the 1 million mark last April, a number it had aimed to reach over a decade ago. The Tesouro Direto platform, aimed at the same type of investors, also reached 1 million active subscribers this year, pushing the total amount of people registered in the system to 4.5 million.

Subscribe via Pocket Cast or  iTunes.
Eric Rosengren isn’t jumping on the interest-rate-cutting bandwagon just yet.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who’s dissented twice this year when his colleagues voted to lower the central bank’s benchmark rate, made clear in a weekend interview he still thinks the U.S. economy is doing just fine, even after a week of soft data. He’s downgraded his growth forecast for 2019 to 1.7% from 2%, but not his policy prescription.
“If the economy grows at 1.7%, consumption continues to be strong, inflation is gradually going up and the unemployment rate is at 3.5%, I would not see a need for additional accommodation” at the Fed’s October or December policy meetings, Rosengren said Saturday on the sidelines of a conference he hosted at the Boston Fed.
He acknowledged that closely-watched economic reports on manufacturing, services and payrolls came in weaker last week than he anticipated. But the labor market remains tight, he said, and he’s confident the U.S. consumer will continue to drive growth.
The week ended with a mixed September jobs report. Employers added 136,000 new positions, lower than economists expected, but the unemployment rate dipped to a half-century low of 3.5%.
Rosengren said it’s unclear whether the payrolls numbers are slowing simply because the labor market is already tight, or because sectors like manufacturing and exports are getting hit harder than expected by ongoing trade disputes and slowing global growth.
Overall, however, “the economy is right where we want it to be” with unemployment low and inflation, while below target, creeping back to toward the Fed’s 2% objective.
Investors aren’t quite as satisfied, and many expect the Fed to provide more insurance against a steeper downturn when officials gather in Washington Oct. 29-30. Pricing in fed funds futures contracts imply a greater than 70% chance of another quarter-point cut at that meeting.
Rosengren says the one factor that may change his outlook is the U.S. consumer, who could pull back on spending if the stock market were to drop sharply, or if gloomy headlines over trade and geopolitical tensions mount.
“We don’t have a great understanding of the behavioral aspects of consumption, so that’s why we have to monitor it closely,” he said.
The Boston Fed chief, the longest-serving current member of the Federal Open Market Committee, said he would support a policy of expanding the Fed’s balance sheet as a “technical adjustment,” perhaps along side the creation of a permanent facility for injecting liquidity into overnight money markets to relieve an apparent tightness in the supply of bank reserves.
“The mechanics of how we do that, I think, remain to be decided, but I would be comfortable with a bigger buffer than what we have now,” Rosengren said. “Some combination of activities that generates an outcome where we don’t have as much volatility in short-term markets makes sense.”
An unexpected shortage of overnight lenders created sudden turmoil in the multitrillion-dollar money market in September, causing rates to spike to record levels and briefly tug the Fed’s benchmark rate out of its target range.

President Donald Trump’s battle against an accelerating impeachment inquiry is growing tougher after a week of damaging revelations and self-inflicted wounds that emboldened Democrats and put the White House on defense.
The president added to the frenzy by publicly calling on Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, echoing the conduct that sparked the impeachment effort -- that the president is leveraging his power to target a political enemy. On top of that, closed-door depositions and the release of a series of text messages bolstered the case further. On Saturday, he lashed out against one of his few Republican critics.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry has paid off so far. And now, the House effort is poised to intensify further in coming days as investigators seek to meet with diplomats, including the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine -- who was reportedly removed by Trump because she failed to facilitate an investigation of Biden.
Trump even appeared resigned to the likelihood of his impeachment -- which would be the third in American history -- as he spoke to reporters on Friday.
“The Democrats, unfortunately, they have the votes,” Trump said. “They could vote very easily.”
The House opened its inquiry with a probe of Trump’s conduct in a July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. After freezing military aid to Ukraine, which is battling a Russia-backed insurgency, the American president asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, one of Trump’s top Democratic rivals in the 2020 presidential contest.

Trump claims that Biden improperly helped his son Hunter profit from business deals in Ukraine and China. The allegations related to Ukraine have been discredited, and those related to China aren’t supported by publicly known details. Joe Biden’s campaign has dismissed the allegations as without merit.
Trump suffered his biggest setback this week with the release of the text messages. Those included U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker telling a Ukrainian official he had “heard from the White House” that a Zelenskiy trip to Washington was conditioned on the Ukrainian leader convincing Trump he’d “get to the bottom” of a probe Trump sought into the 2016 election.
Other texts showed U.S. and Ukrainian officials brokering a proposed announcement of investigations into a Ukrainian gas company that employed Hunter Biden, and alleged electoral interference aimed at undermining Trump. There were also internal exchanges between two Trump administration officials debating whether security assistance from the U.S. would be conditioned on investigations.
“As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” U.S. Charges D’affaires in Ukraine Bill Taylor wrote in one message. The other official said there was no such quid pro quo but then urged an end to text exchanges on the matter.

Democratic lawmakers, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, said in a letter to colleagues that the communications were alarming.
“These text messages reflect serious concerns raised by a State Department official about the detrimental effects of withholding critical military assistance from Ukraine, and the importance of setting up a meeting without further delay,” they wrote.
The president on Friday reiterated his insistence that there hadn’t been any improper pressure, and said he was motivated by rooting out corruption, not winning an election. But when asked by a reporter if he’d ever pressed a world leader to investigate impropriety not related to one of his political enemies, Trump said he would need to check.
Also this week, congressional investigators unveiled documents showing Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, leaned on the State Department to investigate conspiracy theories related to Biden and Ukraine.
Aides to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo cautioned against unfounded reports suggesting that the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine was a hotbed of Democratic support, according to the documents.

In early May, the State Department unexpectedly recalled Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, whom Giuliani falsely accused of helping bring to light secret payments made by the party of Ukraine’s then-President Viktor Yanukovych to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump said Thursday that he’d heard “very, very bad things about her.”
Yovanovitch is scheduled to testify to House investigators next week, although the White House has not said whether they will try to intervene to stop her testimony.
The White House is expected to send Pelosi a letter arguing the president and White House officials can ignore lawmaker demands for documents and testimony unless the House holds a vote formalizing the impeachment inquiry, according to a person familiar with the plans.
The president explained the move as a way to hold House Democrats in vulnerable districts accountable for the impeachment inquiry. He painted the House probe as the work of Pelosi and far-left elements of the party, that he said would be fatal to the re-election prospects of freshmen lawmakers who swept into power during last year’s midterm elections.
The discussion about withholding documents represented a substantial shift in strategy for an administration that initially claimed it had nothing to hide and released records of the Trump-Zelenskiy call as a show of transparency.
On Friday evening, House impeachment investigators subpoenaed the White House for documents on efforts by Trump and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into launching a probe of the Bidens.
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that the subpoena “changes nothing -- just more document requests, wasted time, and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the president did nothing wrong.”
The week’s revelations created anticipation that more damaging details could be revealed in coming weeks. That sense was amplified by a CNN report saying Trump discussed the political prospects of Biden and fellow Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping -- and offered to stay quiet about pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong in exchange for progress on his trade agenda.
Trump himself made matters worse by explicitly calling for China and Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, during a question-and-answer session with journalists. That prompted Democrats and at least one GOP senator to admonish Trump.
“When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,” Senator Mitt Romney of Utah said in a tweet. “By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.”
Trump lashed out Saturday against Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, in a pair of Twitter messages delivered while in a motorcade a few minutes away from his Virginia golf club.
Romney “is a pompous ‘ass’ who has been fighting with me from the beginning,” Trump said. “He is so bad for R’s!”
Trump repeated the assertion that his conversation with Ukraine’s president was “congenial and very appropriate.” In other tweets Trump also assailed Democratic lawmakers Pelosi and Schiff, the media, and the whistle-blower whose account helped kick off the impeachment inquiry.
Asked about his conversation with Xi about the Bidens, Trump this week said he didn’t remember, though he added that he always speaks “in the appropriate way.” Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said his country wouldn’t interfere in the internal affairs of the U.S.
Earlier: Pelosi’s Impeachment Move Takes Democrats on Leap Into Dark
Trump’s public statements came as he has signaled his frustration with the probes in streams of Twitter posts, as well as increasingly bellicose interactions with journalists.
At a joint news conference Wednesday with Finland’s leader, the president berated a reporter who questioned him about Ukraine. Trump ended the news conference without taking a second question from the Finnish press, as is customary during a foreign leader’s visit, and abruptly walked off the stage without shaking President Sauli Niinisto’s hand.
By Friday, the president indicated he was girding for political combat in the face of what he described as “the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country.”
The president said recent Republican victories in special elections in North Carolina provided a “glimpse” of frustration among the electorate toward Democratic tactics, along with his own popularity. In recent days, the president has increasingly cast the impeachment inquiry as an attack on Republican voters.
“I really believe that they’re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls,” Trump said."

The House Intelligence Committee heard Friday from intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who has said he examined a whistle-blower’s complaint about President Donald Trump and Ukraine and found it to be “urgent” and “credible.”
Here are the latest developments:
A second person is considering whether to come forward as a whistle-blower in the investigation of Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, the New York Times reported on Friday night.
The second person, like the whistle-blower whose complaint touched off the House impeachment inquiry, is an intelligence official, the Times said, but has more direct knowledge of what transpired leading up to the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The Times report, which cited two unnamed sources, said the second person had spoken to Atkinson.
House impeachment investigators on Friday subpoenaed the White House for documents on efforts by President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukraine, an escalation in the battle between Democrats and the White House over records and testimony.
Much of the information sought relates to alleged attempts by Trump and Giuliani, as well as others in the administration, to prod Ukraine into launching an investigation to help discredit Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
”We deeply regret that President Trump has put us -- and the nation -- in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena,” the chairmen of three committees wrote.
GOP Senator Ron Johnson says Trump denied to him in August that he linked security aid for Ukraine to Trump’s effort to prod that country into conducting an investigation about the 2016 U.S. election.
Johnson told the Wall Street Journal that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told him that aid was being tied to Trump’s wish for an investigation by Ukraine.
Johnson said he asked Trump about the matter and the president said he would “never do that.”
Chairmen of three House committees asked Vice President Mike Pence Friday to provide documents for the Trump-Ukraine investigation.
The chairmen said in a letter that public reports have “have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president’s stark message to the Ukrainian president.“
The chairmen are seeking, by Oct. 15, any documents Pence has related to his Sept. 1 meeting with Ukraine’s president during which the vice president was reported to have discussed the hold on U.S. security aid to that country.
The committee leaders also requested any documents Pence may have reviewed after Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, because of reports that a member of Pence’s staff may have participated in the call.
Pence’s office said in a statement that the letter “does not appear to be a serious request” and that it has been forwarded to his counsel’s office for a response.
Former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker sought to distance himself from any attempt to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, telling three House committees that he “at no time” was aware of or took part in such an effort.
Volker delivered the statement in his prepared remarks, obtained by Bloomberg News, to a closed door session with the panels on Thursday.
Volker said he didn’t act as a facilitator for Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in setting up meetings or other activities designed to leverage pressure on Ukraine officials for a probe of Biden and his son.
“Notably, I did not listen in on the July 25, 2019, phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskiy, and received only superficial readouts about that conversation afterwards,” he said in the remarks. “I was not aware that Vice President Biden’s name was mentioned, or a request was made to investigate him, until the transcript of this call was released on September 25, 2019.”
He also said he’s known Biden for 24 years and suggestions that he would act as vice president in any manner to benefit his son “simply has no credibility to me.”
Republican Senator Mitt Romney strongly criticized Trump for calling on China and Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.
“By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,” Romney wrote on Twitter Friday.
The Utah senator is one of only a few GOP lawmakers to publicly chastise the president.
Romney also wrote on Twitter, “When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.”
In late September, Romney said he was “deeply troubled” after reading a rough transcript of Trump’s July 25 call that showed the president asking Ukraine’s president to investigate Biden. -- Steven T. Dennis
Republican Senator John Cornyn alleged on Twitter Friday that the Justice Department is reviewing possible conflicts of interest by former Vice President Joe Biden, but a person with knowledge of the matter said the probe that Cornyn referred to doesn’t involve Biden.
Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees and a close Trump ally, said in a tweet Friday that the top law enforcement agency “is investigating foreign government influence, VP Biden conflicts of interest, and possible corruption.” He refused to give any details.
A Cornyn aide clarified that the senator’s tweet saying that the DOJ was investigating the Bidens was actually referring to a possible future expansion of an investigation led by John Durham, a U.S. attorney assigned by Attorney General William Barr to review the origins of the 2016 Justice Department and intelligence agency investigation of Russia’s influence in the 2016 election.
The person with knowledge of the matter said Durham’s investigation doesn’t involve the Bidens.
Trump has denounced the 2016 investigation as a “witch hunt” aimed at hurting him politically. He and his allies have been attempting to raise suspicions about actions by Biden, one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. Trump has publicly sought help from Ukraine and China to investigate Biden, and alleged efforts to do that behind the scenes are now the center of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. -- Steven T. Dennis, Chris Strohm
Trump insisted that he asked Ukraine’s government to re-open investigations into Joe Biden and his family only out of an interest in fighting corruption.
“We want to find out what happened with 2016,” Trump told reporters on Friday as he departed the White House to visit wounded soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “I don’t care about Biden’s campaign, but I do care about corruption.
“I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden,” he added.
Trump’s allegation that Joe Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukraine to abandon an investigation related to a company that employed his son Hunter Biden has been discredited. Trump has also asked Ukraine’s current government to explore an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that people in the country were behind hacks of Democratic Party email accounts during the 2016 election. -- Josh Wingrove
Intelligence Inspector General Michael Atkinson arrived on Capitol Hill to face questions from House investigators regarding a whistle-blower’s complaint about President Donald Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president that is at the center of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.
Intelligence Committee members and staff intend to ask Atkinson about the administration’s initial handling of the whistle-blower’s information. They’ll also ask for corroborating information he found that led him to deem the complaint not only credible, but urgent.
Atkinson first received the complaint Aug. 12, and he determined the report to be credible on Aug. 26 after his initial investigation. House Republicans have raised questions about the origins of the whistle-blower’s report and its credibility. --Billy House
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked in a tweet Friday morning what President Donald Trump promised China “in exchange for interfering in our election?”
“An easier deal on trade? Ignoring crackdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement? Condoning repression of religious freedom?”
Pelosi said in a separate tweet, “Congress must not back down from our duty to defend the Constitution as @realDonaldTrump ignores the Founders’ warnings about foreign interference at every turn.” -- Kasia Klimasinska
At least one Republican senator is worried about Trump’s invitation to China to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a written statement to the Omaha World-Herald, saying it’s up to the justice system to investigate the Bidens, not Beijing.
Ben Sasse
“Hold up: Americans don’t look to Chinese commies for the truth,” Sasse said, according to the newspaper, in one of the strongest rebukes to Trump from a Republican yet. “If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.”
Sasse nonetheless joined Trump in criticizing Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the House’s impeachment investigation. “Congressman Schiff is running a partisan clown show in the House -- that’s his right because the Constitution doesn’t prohibit clown shows, but fortunately, in the Senate, we’re working to follow the facts one step at a time,” Sasse said in his statement.
Speaking to reporters publicly on Thursday, Trump publicly declared some of the things that prompted the whistle-blower complaint in the first place. He called on both Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens as House committees began impeachment inquiries into whether Trump abused his power to get foreign governments to investigate a political rival.
The president defended his comments in a Friday tweet, saying asking other countries to help probe corruption “is done all the time.” -- Josh Wingrove

Trump gave himself a much-needed break from impeachment yesterday by flying to Florida to tout a new executive order pushing some Medicare patients into privately run Medicare Advantage plans. This may be designed to winnow down the strong advantage Dems have on the issue of health care, notes Max Nisen, but  Trump’s plan doesn’t do much for patients. It may lower costs, but it also lowers choices. It could also be called a slippery slope to Medicare privatization.
Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi aren’t exactly on speaking terms these days, but if they were, they might be able to shake hands on a different health-care plan; namely, one to cut high drug prices. Both agree on letting Medicare negotiate prices and setting foreign prices as a ceiling, notes Bloomberg’s editorial board.

A Twitter controversy raged on Thursday and Friday about leading Brexiter Michael Gove’s speech at the German embassy in London, in which he came so close to drawing a parallel between Brexit and German reunification of 1990 that some of the audience heckled him. Whatever Gove actually meant, the discussion of his speech shows the danger of frivolous historical references in the context of today’s controversial political decisions.
Gove, a member of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet, was at the embassy on German Unity Day, the nation’s main holiday, celebrated in memory of West Germany and East Germany coming together in 1990. He started by speaking admiringly of a series of post-World War II German statesmen – Konrad Adenauer, Ludwig Erhard, Willy Brandt and finally Helmut Kohl, who oversaw the reunification as chancellor. 
“The example of modern Germany reminds us how important it is to come together,” Gove said, “it also shows that we can come together quickly when we recognize how important it is to set aside divisions.” Then, without any transition from this anodyne statement, moved on to Brexit: “Britain made its democratic decision three years ago to leave the European Union.”
To some people in the room, this sounded like an attempt to compare the U.K.’s vote in the 2016 referendum with Germany’s reunification. Peter Neumann, a professor at Kings College, tweeted:

Others present, including William Wright, founder of the New Financial think tank, and Wolfgang Blau, chief operating officer at publishing giant Conde Nast International Ltd., shared Neumann’s interpretation that Gove was subtly making a link between East Germany’s break from Soviet rule and the U.K.’s departure from the EU. 
Germans – and Neumann and Blau are German – can be sensitive to false equivalences involving their nation’s thorny history. Brexiters, on the other hand, are known to be fond of such parallels. They repeatedly, and unnecessarily, have dragged World War II and Britain’s part in winning it into the Brexit discussion. Last year, Jeremy Hunt, then the U.K. foreign secretary, likened the EU to the Soviet Union, drawing ire throughout Europe.
Yet it wasn’t just Germans but also British listeners who jeered and rolled their eyes, according to eyewitness accounts, when Gove appeared to be drawing one of those frivolous comparisons.
Gove later denied that he meant to make the Soviet comparison and accused Neumann of trying to “weaponize” his speech for his “own agenda.” But whether Neumann and others in the audience misunderstood him or not, their reactions show clearly what a terribly divisive event Brexit is.
That’s an important, defining difference between Brexit and the German reunification. While there was no perfect unanimity about it in Germany, in 1991, according to Pew Research, 79% of West Germans and 89% of East Germans approved of it. Gove praised Kohl as the leader who “in a supreme act of statesmanship managed to bring the people of Germany together in a unity that we celebrate today.” But what Kohl did was desirable, or at least reasonable, to an overwhelming majority of Germans. The resistance he faced mostly came from overseas. U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was against a united Germany, and even asked Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to do what he could to stop it. 
Gove is right about Kohl’s main legacy: Acting in the interests of his people even though some of his fellow world leaders were apprehensive about the consequences was a supreme act of statesmanship. But by that token, no one should speak of Brexit in the same breath. The 2016 vote was close, and it pitted the majority of voters of Scotland and Northern Ireland (stay) against those of England and Wales (leave). There was no case for trying to overcome the open dismay of the U.K.’s EU allies after such a polarizing vote. Kohl was a statesman; Brexiteers are partisans.
As recorded by the official transcript, Gove’s speech was milquetoast and boring. But in today's fraught situation – with the parliament pitted against the prime minister, the public furiously split, and a majority of Britons feeling that an exit by the Oct. 31 deadline is unlikely – it appears blithely hypocritical of a U.K. minister to discuss Germany’s erasure of an internal border while the cabinet plots a new border in Ireland and perhaps lays the foundations for the breakup of the U.K.
Perhaps Gove truly didn’t hear the false note in his speech. But the U.K. urgently needs leaders able to think clearly about the meaning of Kohl’s example. It’s the unifiers who are remembered gratefully, not the dividers.

Even as central bankers around the world push on with policy easing, some of the biggest developing-nation investors are warning the dash for duration is overdone. After offering six times the return of bonds with less sensitivity to interest-rate changes, high-duration debt has stumbled in the past five weeks on signs the rally may have gone too far.
“The risk is that it unwinds a bit,” said Paul McNamara, a London-based fund manager who helps oversee $9.4 billion in assets at GAM UK. “We really need significantly worse news for rates to continue to rally.”
It’s unclear if a soft U.S. jobs report on Friday would be enough to spur fresh interest after bonds with duration of at least 10 years handed investors an almost 24% return over nine months. According to Vontobel Asset Management, a pivot toward greater fiscal stimulus by governments could also eventually hamper the trade.
“Policy makers are changing and recognizing that monetary policy alone cannot do all the heavy lifting,” said Wouter Van Overfelt, a Zurich-based senior money manager at Vontobel, which oversees 128 billion Swiss francs ($128.6 billion) in assets. “When it happens, or when markets get the impression it will happen, rates will move up and so that is why I think duration is actually a big risk today.”
After a 6% gain in August, bonds with a duration of at least 10 years flipped to a 1.4% loss last month. That compares with a 0.5% gain for debt with duration of zero to 1 year, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index tracking dollar-denominated debt. Those losses have extended into October.
Not everyone agrees the trade is fizzling.
A host of headwinds, from weak U.S. manufacturing data to the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit mean inflation will remain elusive and rates may go lower still, fueling the hunt for yield.
“The environment is still positive for duration,” according to Stuart Ritson, an emerging-market bond fund manager at Aviva Investors in Singapore. “Global growth continues to weaken, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and inflation is still low almost everywhere, and we’ve got continued easing by global central banks.”
Ray Jian, London-based portfolio manager and head of emerging-markets aggregate debt at Amundi Asset Management, is long duration versus his benchmark, but has been trimming the position since the summer.
He cites the risk to the trade from a possible breakthrough in trade talks, which would send yields higher. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He visits Washington for negotiations with his U.S. counterparts next week.
“We believe most of the rally is behind us,” Jian said.

A skydiving expedition culminates in two oxygen-supplemented jumps from the “Roof of the World.”
Most traffic jams are just annoying, but when they happen near the summit of Mount Everest’s 29,029-foot peak, they can be deadly. Eleven people died this season after a mix of erratic weather, a record-breaking number of permits and widespread inexperience caused an hours-long queue at the “top of the world.” But what if there were an alternative way to experience the world’s tallest mountain? Perhaps by hurtling yourself down an empty route at over 130 mph, with nothing but air beneath your feet, an oxygen mask across your face, and the snow-capped Himalayas around you on all sides?   Every November, the Everest Skydive expedition offers one of the highest commercial freefall experiences in the world. Starting at $25,000, guests are guided on an 11-day trek through Nepal that wraps with two tandem skydives from more than 23,000 feet above sea level (AMSL). “The exhilaration of jumping into the Himalayas is unrivaled,” says Tom Noonan, executive director of Everest Skydive. The freefall is matched only by the parachute ride that flies you past the natural wonder as only bar-headed geese on a Himalayan migration can.
A typical recreational skydive is made from 10,000 to 14,000 feet AMSL. Few civilian drop zones offer trips higher than 18,000 feet in the U.S., and only one—SkyDance, in Davis, Calif.—is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to allow oxygen-supplemented jumps from above 28,000 feet. (That one will run you $3,000, although the views of California’s central valley may not quite compare.)
Skydiving has seen a boost in popularity since the days of round canopies and combat boots. The sport reached the masses with the advent of the tandem parachute system in the early ‘80s, received a push from the 1991 film Point Break, and then had a breakthrough in the age of social media. The United States Parachute Association (USPA), the sport’s domestic governing body, issued more than 4,200 new basic skydiving licenses in 2018 and now has the highest membership levels in its 72-year history.Mountaineering experienced a similar trajectory in growth. The allure of conquering the least hospitable reaches of nature led to the commercialization of Everest in the ‘90s. The following decades brought an influx of people making the trophy-hunting pilgrimage. With the rise of the local low-cost operators that set out to undercut foreign competitors came many unseasoned climbers.
Of the 381 permits Nepal issued in 2019, “about 50% shouldn’t have been on the mountain,” says Alan Arnette, a mountaineer and Everest chronicler.
This year, the median price for the two-month climb was around $45,000, though some outfits offered treks for as little as $28,000. In August, as a response to the deadly bottlenecks, Nepal proposed a plan to cut down on permits by placing a $35,000 minimum charge on operators. Climbers must now also submit proof of having summited at least one 21,300-foot peak before testing Everest.Everest Skydive is in its twelfth year of operation and Noonan estimates that he’s made nearly 200 jumps in Nepal. For the former retirement planner turned skydiving industry guru, those are just a small fraction of his 8,000-plus jump logbook. But he’s not the only accomplished jumper in camp. His team consists of several world-record-holding skydivers and aims to allocate one staff member to each guest. 
Guests arrive in Kathmandu and start their trip with sightseeing tours that double as acclimating days. Then they board a puddle-jumping flight to one of the world’s most dangerous landing strips: Lukla Airport. At over 9,300 feet AMSL, Lukla’s 1,729-foot runway sits between a mountain-sized rock and the abyss. “It’s the closest thing to landing on an aircraft carrier I can think of,” says Noonan, a pilot himself. “These pilots are some of the best I’ve ever met.” The lead-up to the jumps involves further trekking and acclimatization as they head to Namche Bazaar at 11,286 feet AMSL. As part of the cost, the crew provides all the services and luxury accommodations along the trails through partnerships they’ve developed in the region. The biggest expense and logistical obstacle comes from transporting a functional skydiving drop zone to the Syangboche airport, a 1,200-foot dirt airstrip at 12,340 feet AMSL, or the even higher Ama Dablam Base Camp, at 15,000 feet. Nearly 2,000 pounds of equipment must be moved up the mountain.On jump day, guests and instructors board the AS350 B3 helicopter and start the 15-minute ascent up the Himalayas. 
The group had previously used a Pilatus PC-6 fixed-wing aircraft, but the B3 allows for easier navigation in spite of a shorter service ceiling. For guests, the rotary-wing is better for its scenic capabilities, offering an intimate exposure to the mountains. At times, rock faces are a mere 100 feet away.Then there’s the jump. Freefall lasts 40 seconds; descent slows at approximately 19,000 feet AMSL, once the parachute deploys overhead. The loud blast of air in freefall is exchanged for a serene canopy ride that lasts about five minutes before touchdown at the drop zone.Some guests opt for a $3,000 addition that extends the trip to Everest Base Camp. The six-day walk finishes with views of the Khumbu Icefalls and the mountain’s South Col, followed by a 15-minute helicopter ride back to Lukla. 
Not everyone is convinced. “Call me old fashioned, but these sorts of stunts are disingenuous to the spirit of the mountain,” says Arnette. “What makes this different than the low-cost mercenaries commercializing the mountain?”To Noonan, the difference lies in the relationships he has cultivated with the people of the region. “The community tells us how thrilled they are to see parachutes over Namche Bazaar,” he says. “We go back year after year, not in celebration of ourselves and our own accomplishments, but in celebration of the mountain, the people, the culture, and ultimately, the friendships we have made.”He is planning a 2020 project called Skydive Earth, which will include expeditions to the North and South poles, the pyramids at Giza, the Aran Islands, and the white sand beaches along the Great Barrier Reef.

Relying on grandiose plots to play politics has opened Trump up to impeachment in the Ukraine scandal.
Conspiracy theories worked well for Donald Trump politically – until, maybe, now.
In the late 1980s, Donald Trump got into a feud with another prominent New York developer, Leonard Stern, over a story that a Stern-owned magazine, 7 Days, ran about the weak resale value of some Trump condominiums. Stern was also funding an unflattering documentary about Trump, and amid the squabble Trump confided to his advisers at the Trump Organization that Stern was part of a broader cabal of jealous Manhattan builders out to get him.Shortly after that, as he started to tip into corporate and personal bankruptcy in the early 1990s, Trump lashed out at reporters, telling his advisers that unflattering stories about financial difficulties he brought upon himself were the work of a vindictive cabal of media types also out to get him.There was some paranoia laced through all of this, of course, and some of the emotional and psychological tensions that make an avid conspiracy theorist. But none of it amounted to the purposeful and broadly orchestrated plot mongering that Trump unfurled when he embraced birtherism in 2011 and aggressively promoted the idea that Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. (and therefore wasn’t qualified to be president).One of the telling aspects of Trump’s turn to sprawling conspiracy theorizing eight years ago, and his subsequent immersion in it, is that it’s one of the few signature pieces of his current repertoire that isn’t a throwback. Most of Trump’s behaviors are decades old. Peddling conspiracies is a relatively recent phenomenon. And his deployment of half-baked, bonkers schemes attached to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, as well as some of his ludicrous theories about Ukraine as a haven for interference in the 2016 presidential election, have boomeranged on him in ways I’m sure he never anticipated.When Trump was able to get airtime on national television shows by questioning the whereabouts of Obama’s birth certificate – and then saw his standing in early 2012 among Republican presidential contenders soar from fifth place to a tie for first, in part, for the same reason – lights must have gone on in his head. Trump the businessman was intimate with the powers of spin, hyperbole and celebrity, but Trump the politician — a much more recent invention — had to find his way.Trump was never going to be someone who distinguished himself politically through policy expertise or visionary leadership. But as someone who could appeal to the fear of outsiders (like Chinese exporters and Mexican immigrants, for example) or stoke racism (toward Obama, for one) and clothe that sentiment as “politics,” bingo. Conspiracies, scantily sourced as “people are saying” and often so fact-free that they left Trump as the sole arbiter of their merit, offered a convenient way to erode voters’ faith in opponents or institutions and became one of his go-to political tools.“American politics has often been an arena for angry minds,” the historian Richard Hofstadter observed in “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” his famous 1964 essay. “I call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.”Fr. Charles Coughlin, the anti-Semitic “radio priest” of the 1930s, and Senator Joseph McCarthy, who used a new medium, television, to stoke the anti-Communist red scare of the 1950s, were exemplars of Hofstadter’s thinking. Trump, who’s used social media and Fox News’s talk shows to propagate conspiracies, stands squarely on their shoulders.“Donald Trump’s supporters lap up every conspiracy theory he pushes out there,” one pollster noted in 2016, the year in which lessons Trump learned from selling birtherism helped pave his way to the White House. Trump launched his presidential campaign by accusing the Mexican government of plotting to export rapists and other criminals to the U.S. As the campaign wore on, he took to stating that Muslim Americans broadly and secretly supported terrorism.Trump regularly quotes or tweets conspiracy theorists and has spouted tin-hat stuff on everything from the Deep State, Obama’s efforts to wiretap Trump Tower, Muslims trying to establish sharia law in the U.S., and global warming as a Chinese hoax, to windmills causing cancer, white genocide in South Africa, voter fraud in the 2016 election, questions about the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the health risks of asbestos as a “con” pushed by organized crime, and the big one, Robert Mueller’s “Witch Hunt.”Trump got attention, and traction with his electoral base, with much of this. None of it really hurt him. But his recent efforts to choreograph, and not merely disseminate, a grandiose conspiracy theory — that the Bidens profited from corruption in Ukraine and that that country itself was the real villain of the 2016 election — have snapped back on him. His phone calls to Ukraine’s leader to further the scheme have landed him in an impeachment inquiry. The machinations of loose-cannon compadres like Rudy Giuliani have come to haunt him.There’s still much that has to play out in all of this, but at a minimum the president is getting a very rapid political education. He’s learning the difference between promoting myths that are merely incendiary or hateful and more broad-based conspiracy theories that test the limits of the law.

President Donald Trump is making his case against an impeachment inquiry by relying on the same tricks and tactics he used to fight the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
He’s called it a hoax, fake news and a witch hunt. He’s attacked investigators as partisans, called the process unfair and prematurely claimed exoneration.
Here’s a closer look at Trump’s playbook.
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Early on, Trump argued there was “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia – a legally vague term that sets a higher bar than whether there was any improper contact.
“Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ‘no evidence’ of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.” – Trump tweet, May 8, 2017, referring to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has set a similarly high bar, arguing that there was “no quid pro quo” between his administration and the Ukrainian government, setting a higher bar than whether he improperly pressured the country, which has asked for U.S. aid in its conflict with Russia.
“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” – Trump tweet, Sept. 24, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump cited memos from former FBI Director James Comey, an inspector general’s report, a FISA warrant and charges against Russian hackers that he said exonerated him, even though none did and some were actually quite damning.
“James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.” – Trump tweet, April 19, 2018
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has argued that the transcript of his telephone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy rebuffed his critics, even though it showed him asking for an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter after talking about U.S. military aid.

“Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise!” – Trump tweet, Sept. 25, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly argued that not only did Russia not help his campaign, but that it actually tried to help get Hillary Clinton elected, directly contradicting the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community and Mueller’s investigation.
“There was no collusion between us and Russia. In fact, the opposite. Russia spent a lot of money on fighting me.” – Trump press remarks, Aug. 10, 2017
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has argued that not only did he not improperly pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, but that Joe Biden improperly pushed Ukraine to drop it, even though prosecutors had already halted the investigation a year earlier.
“The Ukrainian Government just said they weren’t pressured at all during the ‘nice’ call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son’s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That’s the real story!” – Trump tweet, Sept. 22, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly called the investigation a “hoax,” any reporting about his campaign “fake news,” and the entire matter a “witch hunt” and “presidential harassment.”
“There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!” – Trump tweet, April 27, 2018
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has used many of the same terms arguing about the current inquiry, adding repeatedly that his call with the Ukrainian president was “perfect.”
“The congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle’ Adam Schiff’s fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!” – Trump tweet, Oct. 1, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly argued that Comey was a “slimeball,” former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was “disgraced,” Mueller had a conflict of interest, that his team was full of partisan Democrats and that congressional investigators were “liars and leakers.”
“Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue. The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint, when in actuality he is the exact opposite.” – Trump tweet, Nov. 27, 2018

UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has focused his ire on House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who oversaw the request for the complaint by a whistle-blower that touched off the investigation.
“Liddle’ Adam Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistle-blower, even though he or she only had second hand information, ‘is credible.’ How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!” – Trump tweet, Sept. 26, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump called witnesses, investigators and critics liars: Former campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos, Comey, McCabe, former CIA Director John Brennan, and Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, among others.
“James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI.” – Trump tweets, April 13, 2018
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has repeatedly attacked Schiff for reading a parody of the Zelenskiy call at a congressional hearing, arguing that he was lying to the public about the call and should be forced out of office.
“Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!” – Trump tweet, Sept. 27, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly claimed without evidence that the Russia investigation started because of a dossier provided by Michael Steele, a former British spy, even though the FBI says it began after a tip from an Australian diplomat.
“House votes on controversial FISA ACT today.’ This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?” – Trump tweet, Jan. 11, 2018
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump argued that the inspector general for the intelligence community changed a whistle-blower form to allow secondhand information in August. The inspector general and fact checkers rebutted the claim, which originated on a conservative website.
“WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLE-BLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLE-BLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!” – Trump tweet, Sept. 30, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump argued that the special counsel investigation was a distraction from serious issues that he needed to focus on as president.
“Sorry, I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.” – Trump tweet, May 29, 2018
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has called his congressional critics “Do Nothing Democrats,” arguing that impeachment is hurting their ability to legislate, specifically arguing that Congress “can’t talk about gun regulation” because “they’re so tied up” with impeachment.
“It is disgraceful what the Do Nothing Democrats are doing (the Impeachment Scam), but it is also disgraceful what they are NOT doing, namely, the USMCA vote, Prescription Drug Price Reduction, Gun Safety, Infrastructure, and much more!” – Trump tweet, Sept. 28, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly called reporting on his campaign’s contacts with Russia “fake news” and argued that the news media was making up stories.
“Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower.” – Trump tweet, Aug. 5, 2018
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has argued that the news media is not fairly covering his interactions with Ukraine or Bidens.
“You know who’s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say, in many cases, the ‘corrupt media’ — because you’re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it’s corrupt.” – Trump news conference, Oct. 2, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump’s first response to the release of hacked Democratic emails in 2016 was to argue that Democrats actually released the emails themselves as a distraction. A variation of this long-debunked theory even made it into his call with Zelenskiy.
“We believe it was the DNC that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.” – Trump campaign statement, June 15, 2016
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Citing a New York Times article that the whistle-blower talked with a member of Schiff’s staff before filing the complaint, Trump argued without evidence that it was proof that Schiff actually wrote the complaint himself.
“Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before. I’d go a step further: I think he’s probably helped write it. Okay? That’s what the word is.” – Trump news conference, Oct. 2, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump argued that the FBI, the special counsel and other investigators were part of a “deep state” conspiracy within the government to bring down his presidency.
“Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!” – Trump tweet, May 23, 2018
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has made allusions to the so-called “deep state,” while one of his senior advisers, Stephen Miller, argued that the whistle-blower was a “deep state operative, pure and simple” on Fox News Sunday.
“Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistle-blower isn’t a Whistle-blower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?” – Trump tweet, Sept. 27, 2019
MUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump argued that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was treasonous, even though the Constitution strictly defines that as waging war against the U.S. or aiding its enemies.
“Such a great victory in court yesterday on the Russian Hoax, the greatest political scam in the history of our Country. TREASON! Hopefully, the Attorney General of the United States, and all of those working with him, will find out, in great detail, what happened. NEVER AGAIN!!!!” – Trump tweet, July 31, 2019
UKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has also argued that Schiff’s handling of the investigation is treasonous, in particular a parody of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call he read in Congress. He also suggested in private remarks that the whistle-blower was a “spy” and guilty of “treason.”
“Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?” – Trump tweet, Sept. 30, 2019

189,HUNT,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-04/gop-s-sasse-slams-trump-china-plea-on-bidens-impeachment-update,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-04/in-twist-disney-hawks-frozen-and-star-wars-toys-on-same-day,"October 4, 2019, 12:00 AM EDT",Disney Launches New ‘Frozen’ and ‘Star Wars’ Toys on Same Day,"With two of its most toy-friendly movies coming out between now and Christmas, Walt Disney Co. released products tied to both “Frozen 2” and “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” on Friday, hoping parents will pick up a blue sparkly dress and a Kylo Ren action figure on the same trip.
The double-barreled launch is unusual but reflects shifting buying patterns among consumers, and changes in the marketing of the brands.
Hasbro Inc., the main toy licensee for “Star Wars,” has said the last big promotion, in 2017, started too early in the year. This one is a month later. Retailers, meanwhile, didn’t want to set up for two separate Disney toy rollouts in short order.
The Burbank, California-based entertainment giant is relying heavily on social media to promote both launches, in part because online purchases account for about 40% of U.S. toy sales.
“It’s an opportunity for Disney to combine the properties and drive people to retail,” said Jim Silver, editor of TTPM.com, a toy-industry website. “You could do shopping for both.”
Disney began promoting the new “Star Wars” toys in a global live-streamed event from London last week that featured many of the series’ stars seeing their action figures for the first time.
The company is calling this week’s release Triple Force Friday because the toys and other items are tied to a new “Star Wars” TV show, video game and movie. “The Rise of Skywalker” hits theaters in December.
Frozen Fan Fest, meanwhile, began Wednesday with the first of some 200 social-media influencers and celebrities from 30 countries taking the new merchandise out of boxes, a stunt that is expected to last several days. “Frozen 2” will be released on Nov. 22.
Frozen 2 dolls
“Star Wars” fans, meanwhile, had to look harder for stores participating in “midnight madness,” an event where retailers opened their stores at midnight to sell the new toys.
“Very few stores are doing any sort of extended-hours ‘midnight madness’ sale for Triple Force Friday,” said Daniel Pickett, editor in chief of Action Figure Insider.
That’s due in part to changes in the retail landscape. Toys “R” Us shuttered all of its U.S. stores last year, although four Canadian locations participated in the midnight promotion.
Walmart Inc. started selling the toys at midnight in about 50 locations, albeit ones that were already open 24 hours. Fans could check if their local outlet was participating on the company’s website.
Target Corp. wasn’t planning any midnight openings, although the chain is launching Disney store-within-a-store concepts at 25 locations on Friday. They’ll sell both “Frozen 2” and “Star Wars” items.
Disney, of course, was still on board with midnight shopping at its namesake stores in Orlando, Florida; Anaheim, California; and New York’s Times Square, as well as a handful of other cities.
The $150 D-O interactive droid featured in “Skywalker”
New items include a $150 D-O interactive droid featured in “Skywalker” and a 6-inch Mandalorian action figure ($20), based on the TV series that debuts on Disney’s new streaming service next month. Both are from Hasbro.
Michael Wistock, a 50-year-old telecom executive and longtime “Star Wars” fan, said he would compensate for the lack of midnight openings by visiting a local ThinkGeek store, which is opening an hour earlier on Friday, to shop for “Star Wars” bobble-heads for his daughter. “As long as I can go somewhere and hunt with other collectors, that’s what’s important to me,” he said.
When the first “Frozen” film turned out to be a runaway hit in 2013, Disney was caught off guard by the huge demand for products. This year, Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink expects the “Frozen 2” dolls alone to generate some $500 million in sales.
“The first ‘Frozen’ was a total surprise,” said Marty Brochstein, a senior vice president at trade group Licensing International. “This is the first big unified shot at merchandising ‘Frozen.’”
“Star Wars” was the top-selling toy brand in the U.S. as recently as 2016, the year after Disney rebooted the franchise with “The Force Awakens.” Last year, it fell to sixth place, according to market researcher NPD.
“I expect that ‘Star Wars’ will remain among the top-selling properties for 2019, as it has been for over a decade,” said Juli Lennett, an analyst with NPD. “Where it lands depends on the Force.”

There's nothing cuddly about the 5,000 or so Komodo dragons that still roam the wild. They’re aggressive, venomous predators that can reach 10 feet long and weigh more than 150 pounds. They've been known to occasionally attack humans, sometimes fatally. Nonetheless, growing numbers of tourists are flocking to Komodo island to see them. And starting next year, they'll pay up to $1,000 for the privilege.This new ""membership fee,"" announced Monday, is intended to reduce over-tourism, and perhaps save Komodo’s signature species in the process. If it works, it could act as a model for some of the world’s most ecologically sensitive sites, and the local communities that too often fail to see the benefits of the global ecotourism boom.Until recently, the idea that Komodo, a 150 square-mile mountainous rock in the middle of the Indonesian archipelago, might become a tourist attraction was far-fetched. It was sparsely populated for centuries, known almost exclusively to locals. In the early 20th century, rumors of giant crocodiles inhabiting the island reached a Dutch explorer who promptly traveled to Komodo and shot one. A few years later, he was followed by an American whose travels reportedly inspired the original “King Kong” film, and resulted in the Bronx Zoo's first, brief Komodo dragon exhibit (the star attractions died soon after arrival).Over the next half century, interest in the lizards drew a small but growing number of adventurous tourists. By 1980, their numbers were big enough that the Indonesian government established Komodo National Park to protect the dragons. Locals, who had been making a living on the island for hundreds of years, weren’t consulted on the park, its boundaries – or most distressingly – the government’s plans to relocate them. The mandate to create a pristine conservation area set the stage for decades of disputes over tourism, resource access and indigenous rights.
That’s not an isolated problem. Most of the world's national parks were created in part by evicting communities to create ""people-free"" environments that could be marketed to tourists. In Tanzania, such efforts are widely blamed for displacing the Masai from their ancestral lands; in the Amazon, indigenous locals complain that the bounty generated by ecotourists flows to everyone but them. A recent study in the Congo Basin found that conservation measures had displaced whole villages, leading to economic distress, violent conflict, human-rights abuses, and a decline in populations of endangered species, including elephants and chimps, due to increased poaching.On Komodo, the tensions historically haven’t run that high. Poaching has been largely confined to the deer that the dragons hunt, not the lizards themselves. Meanwhile, the isolated and restricted range of the giant lizards has made it easier to pursue a successful conservation strategy, especially compared to failed efforts to support other signature Indonesian species, including critically endangered orangutans.But thanks to a tourist boom, that uneasy balance is becoming harder to sustain. In 2018, 176,000 people visited Komodo, up from 44,000 in 2008. That influx has led to problems familiar to other ecotourist zones: Trash is piling up, poaching is on the rise and locals are increasingly frustrated that the government is granting valuable development rights to outsiders. Meanwhile, dragon populations are in a slow but perpetual decline.
The local government's initial response was predictable: It announced that Komodo island would be closed for all of 2020 to protect the lizards, while about 2,000 residents were to be relocated. Thankfully, public pressure opposing that plan appears to have had an effect. This week, the government changed its mind and announced it was imposing the membership fees instead.
That should reduce the number of tourists visiting Komodo, while providing money to bolster conservation efforts. But a longer-term solution will require ensuring that benefits flow more directly to local communities – for instance, by giving them significant shareholdings in tourist concessions and extending their rights to manage and benefit from wildlife. That’s a lesson that plenty of other ecotourism hotspots should heed. Fewer people may end up seeing Komodo's dragons. But the dragons themselves will have the chance to thrive. And so, ideally, will the locals.

Lagging or leading, macro or micro, global or domestic. For investors, all that matters to keep the bull market intact is whether this week’s torrent of data is flashing a recession ahead or just a few local shocks. 
In a market so divided on the outlook, every piece of data holds the prospect of vindication or rebuttal -- and numbers on Thursday just handed fresh ammo to the bears. A U.S. services gauge dropped to a three-year low in September and jobless claims rose more than expected, shortly after a euro-zone report showing a factory slump has spread to services.
All of that is adding to signs that the U.S.-China trade war is taking a toll on growth, and that dovish central banks may not be able to contain the damage. It could be key to resolving the contradiction across major assets that has defined 2019: Treasury yields are back near the lowest in three years, while U.S. stocks are about 5% from the all-time high and still enjoying the best year since 2013.
Friday’s payrolls report suddenly looks vital.
“The market has been a bit out of sync with economic indicators,” said Dirk Thiels, head of investment management at KBC Asset Management NV. “The global manufacturing sector is in a recession, and there are signs that this is possibly also infecting the rest of the economy.”
The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index dropped to 52.6 last month, still holding above the 50 dividing line between contraction and expansion but missing even the lowest forecast Bloomberg survey.
Also this week: American vehicle sales numbers were poor and ISM’s factory gauge plunged, though construction spending showed signs of life even as it missed expectations.
All this explains why, under the surface, equity markets have been getting cautious again. After an abrupt rally in riskier stocks at the start of September, investors have returned to a defensive playbook.
The momentum strategy -- which has been stuffed with safer shares -- is back, as are low-volatility stocks. Highly leveraged companies are losing ground. The brief recovery in value shares, which tend to be more exposed to the economic cycle, has once again been halted.
In the bond market, investors are taking few chances. Cash has flowed toward the safest government instruments, and the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries has dropped almost 40 basis points in less than a month to well below 1.6%.
At the same time bets for easier monetary policy have surged. Fed fund futures are now pricing in a more-than 80% chance of a rate cut this month, compared with less than 50% a week ago, despite some policy makers trying to paint an upbeat picture.
After two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, the focus is on whether monetary officials have the firepower to breathe life into the global production cycle and stem the spillover into the service sector.
“It’s pretty much a given that the effectiveness of monetary policy is maxed out, in Europe and Japan,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity and quantitative strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. “The Fed has a bit of room for maneuver, but the transmission effects are quite small.”
The conflicted markets are on show beyond stocks and government bonds. Corporate debt sales are surging as borrowing costs drop, and investors are snapping them up in a hunt for yield. Still, the recent uptick in premiums for the riskiest American company obligations over investment grade underscores deteriorating investor sentiment.
On Wednesday, data from the ADP Research Institute showed private payrolls increased by 135,000 in September, the least in three months and less than the median forecast. Friday’s official jobs report may paint a fuller picture: expectations are for non-farm payrolls to rise 147,000, which would underscore the continued strength of the labor market that’s giving bulls ammo.
Even if the jobs data comes and goes without incident, it might not be enough to extend this year’s stock bull run, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG. The warnings from the manufacturing sector are impossible to ignore.
“While investors debate whether we’re entering a recession, we believe the backdrop is better described as a ‘semi-recession,’ a contraction in industrial activity accompanied by healthy economics elsewhere,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “Absent a re-acceleration in cyclical data, stock upside appears limited.”

Now, as the rest of the world joins them in an increasingly desperate hunt for yield, the Australians are having to find new ways to bolster returns.
Australia’s A$2.9 trillion ($2 trillion) pension pool is the fastest-growing among the seven biggest economies and is projected to almost double in size to A$5.4 trillion in a decade. The rapid growth has largely been driven by a mandatory savings system and the fact that the funds have traditionally had a higher appetite for risk than their counterparts in other advanced economies.

That’s because 86% of their assets are tied to “defined contribution” plans where the savers bear the risk, not the employer. With a limited domestic pool of securities and debt, they have for years sought returns around the world. Australian funds allocated 16% of their investments on average in bonds last year, compared with 60% in Japan and 53% in the U.K., according to data from global risk adviser Willis Towers Watson Plc.
Now, funds globally are grappling with $14 trillion of negative-yielding bonds, with only 1% of the $56 trillion investment-grade bond market yielding more than 5%. As big funds from G-7 nations muscle in on the higher-risk territory in a desperate search for yield, many Australian funds are tapping ever more exotic ways to service their clients.
“You’re being pushed to do different things in this environment,” said Con Michalakis, chief investment officer of South Australia’s largest fund, Statewide Superannuation Pty. His A$9.7 billion fund has doubled investments in alternative assets over the past decade, including an earlier bet on a container terminal in Gdansk, Poland, and more recently, a A$100 million investment in a European unlisted infrastructure fund. “I can almost guarantee you that every super fund’s bond weightings have gone down, or are going lower.”
Australian pensions have ramped up allocations to alternative assets

The value of negative-yielding debt has jumped 70% this year as central banks from the U.S. to Australia slash interest rates to combat anemic growth. Pensions, traditionally some of the biggest buyers of government debt, have little choice but to seek income elsewhere.
Australian pensions were already there. Since 2006, they more than doubled investments in hedge funds and other alternatives, and increased allocations to private equity and infrastructure, according to Sydney-based pension researcher Chant West.
The nation’s sovereign wealth investment vehicle, the Future Fund had almost 30% of its A$163 billion in investments tied up in private equity and alternatives at June 30, with only 9% in debt. Ten years ago, fixed-income accounted for nearly a quarter of the fund’s assets under management.
Bonds are not only eye-wateringly pricey, they’re no longer the safe havens they’re perceived to be, according to Sam Sicilia, chief investment officer of Host-Plus Pty, Australia’s top-performing retirement fund. The A$43 billion fund for hospitality workers has zero investments in government bonds and Sicilia said he plans to keep it that way.
“Bonds are outrageously expensive, and even if you were to buy them and hold on, who’s going to buy them off you?” said Melbourne-based Sicilia. “Anybody who thinks these bonds are defensive are dreaming.”

The fund’s ‘default’ option is to put 76% into growth assets such as equities and infrastructure. It’s able to splash billions on things like a railway station in Melbourne’s central business district or a Mexican toll road partly because the average age of its savers is about 35, meaning they won’t withdraw their retirement savings any time soon, according to Sicilia.
Host-Plus is now hunting for illiquid assets “anywhere on this planet,” he said. One favored option to avoid competing with bigger overseas funds is to create your own investment. “If you can get 10 investors to work together to build infrastructure assets, then you can create your own supply and therefore not compete to pay high prices,” he said.

A year ago, Melbourne-based Construction & Building Unions Superannuation partnered with Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board and Australia’s First State Super to buy a 10% stake of U.K. port operator Forth Ports Ltd. And in August, AustralianSuper Pty teamed up with funds in Canada, Singapore and Abu Dhabi to create a fund to finance ports and logistics in India.
“We’re not constrained to sovereign and investment-grade only,” said Ian Patrick, Sydney-based chief investment officer at A$69 billion Sunsuper Pty, which is lending to energy companies. “Like any exposure to illiquidity we take on, we do that quite consciously knowing the cashflow position of our fund.”
Private equity and venture capital are other popular alternatives. Aussie pension funds including Host-Plus and Telstra Super Pty helped VCs raise a record A$1.3 billion last year, up from A$200 million in 2014, Australian Investment Council data show.
Host-Plus has put money into early stage companies such as employee-feedback firm Culture Amp Pty and graphic-design platform Canva Inc. via VC firms including Blackbird Ventures.
AustralianSuper wants to invest more in private equity over the next three to five years as the nation’s biggest pension fund seeks to benefit from the “liquidity premium” attached to unlisted assets, said Chief Investment Officer Mark Delaney. 
As Australian pensions rub shoulders with the likes of Japan Post Bank Co. and U.S. giant California Public Employees’ Retirement System in the quest for higher yield, asset prices are rising to records, prompting some to warn that the risk may become excessive.
As the cost to borrow falls, less credit-worthy companies that might have previously struggled to secure loans have been cashing in on the thirst for yield. Investors poured $3.3 billion into junk-bond funds in the week ended Sept. 18, the most since February, according to data from Refinitiv’s Lipper.
Statewide’s Michalakis and Host-Plus’ Sicilia both said their investments were subject to strict liquidity criteria.
“Private equity and unlisted assets are not a panacea in this world just because rates are low,” said Michalakis. You only get in, “if you understand what you’re buying.”
Still, a rise in inflation, a resolution to the trade war or a pick-up in economic growth could ease the pressure on bonds and trigger a global sell-off in such assets.
“People may well persuade themselves that the risks may be lower than what they actually are,” said Anthony Asher, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales who sat on the investment committees of insurers Prudential Plc and Hollard Insurance Co. “One might just have to bite the bullet and realize that we need to get used to the low returns and if we don’t, we take risks that we are likely to regret.”
For now, the chance of a sudden spike in inflation remains muted, said Shamik Dhar, London-based chief economist for BNY Mellon Investment Management. But the dilemma facing pension funds shows just how much the normal investment pattern has changed.
“It’s a crazy world,” Dhar said. “If interest-rates suddenly do go up, people will start facing massive losses on their safe assets and their risky assets as well.”

Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg’s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.
It’s not just Boris Johnson and his Brexit twists and turns or Donald Trump and his tariffs that are preoccupying the EU these days. The body has been gripped by a scalp-hunting drama in its own micro-bubble. The packed hearings of prospective commissioners have seen two candidates sent home and several others asked to come back for  further questioning. In the hot seat today will be former Italian premier Paolo Gentiloni, who’ll no doubt face uncomfortable questions from EU lawmakers about how he plans to handle his country’s notoriously strained budget relations with Brussels. And then there’s the Greek nominee and vice-president-designate Margaritis Schinas whose “Protecting our European Way of Life” portfolio has raised more than a few eyebrows.  
— Viktoria Dendrinou
Boris’s Burden | The next few days will be crucial for Johnson, who yesterday sent the EU his  new Brexit blueprint. If he fails to get an accord, he faces a showdown with Parliament and a court battle.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said his plan needs more work, while the Irish government said it didn’t look like the basis for a deal. It’s not looking promising.
Content Police | Facebook could be  forced to patrol its platform across the world to remove offensive and hateful posts by users in the EU in what could be a landmark privacy ruling today by the bloc’s top court. The social media behemoth has warned that freedom of speech could be at risk if a worldwide obligation to hunt down content is imposed on the company and other technology giants. 
Forex Loans | Polish banks will be looking to the European Court of Justice for a verdict on the power of national courts in dealing with abusive terms of foreign-currency loans to home buyers. For a decade, selling Swiss-franc mortgages to Poles seeking cheaper ways to fund home purchases helped local banks gain customers. But it backfired, triggering a battle over compensating borrowers.
Quiet Polls | Portugal’s general election comes after five years of growth that have seen unemployment halved. Next to the populism and factionalism plaguing neighbors Spain and Italy, the Iberian nation looks like an island of stability. But there’s also a fragility to its success, a nagging sense that Prime Minister Antonio Costa may not have done all he can to  prepare the country for a downturn. 
Jet Wars | The WTO gave Trump the go-ahead to impose tariffs on as much as $7.5 billion worth of European exports annually, the most in its history, in retaliation for illegal government aid to Airbus. The ruling is a milestone in the WTO’s longest-running dispute that will further test transatlantic relations, which have deteriorated under Trump’s “America First” strategy. Airbus said  U.S. jobs will be threatened if its planes and parts are hit by the tariffs.
Unicorn Barriers | EU policymakers yearn for startups that can kick-start economic growth, yet they haven’t given them the tools they need to share profits with employees. For entrepreneurs and VCs, the problem isn’t just about attracting top talent. The  compensation bind may also be why Europe doesn’t produce world-beating tech companies at the same level as the U.S.
Tax Powers | Emmanuel Macron is planning to give tax authorities the  power to harvest data from Facebook, Instagram and other social media outlets to help detect fraud. His administration is pushing ahead with the plan to be part of its 2020 budget despite objections of the national privacy regulator, which said the move would raise questions about the government’s use of personal data.
Polish Rates | Poland maintained  record-low borrowing costs as conflicting forces inside the central bank were unable to shift interest rates in either direction. Other eastern European countries have been similarly reluctant to tinker with borrowing costs. Despite weakness in nearby Germany, the region’s economies continue to expand rapidly, making rate cuts unnecessary. 
 
Germany’s five leading research institutes  slashed forecasts for economic growth, as manufacturers in Europe’s biggest economy struggle with waning global demand and lingering trade disputes. Gross domestic product will expand by 1.1% in 2020, the experts predicted in outlooks published yesterday. In April, they expected growth of 1.8%. Their report forms the basis of the government’s forecasts, due to be updated around the middle of this month.

From Berlin to New York to San Francisco, capping rents is the worst solution to unaffordable housing.
It’s a little more complicated.

California and Oregon recently imposed them. New York, Paris and Stockholm are adding more. And just about every other booming metropolis in the West is thinking about introducing them: rent controls.
The most extreme case may be Berlin. Its leftist government plans to cap most rents for five years and let tenants who spend more than 30% of their income on housing get reductions. Simultaneously, a petition is underway for a referendum to expropriate rental units from big corporate landlords.
Interventions in the housing market, which had their heyday during and just after World War II, are in fashion again. The appeal is obvious. Places like Amsterdam or San Francisco, precisely because they offer so much opportunity, attract newcomers. That demand drives up rents and crowds out poorer residents. The result is gentrification, inequality — and often misery, as apartment-hunting becomes ever more stressful.
Unfortunately, simply capping rents is the worst answer to this problem. In its flawed logic, it resembles fixing the price of bread when food becomes unaffordable. The effect is merely to exchange one form of scarcity (high prices) for another (empty shelves). In the case of rent controls, the distortions go even further.
A brute freeze on all rents would destroy any incentive to build new units. That’s why even proponents of controls usually want to apply them only to older apartments, leaving new and future ones free. In Berlin, for example, legislators have arbitrarily chosen 2013 as the cutoff construction year.
That splits the rental market in two. In the smaller market for new and unregulated apartments, rents soar even faster. People who move into a city are in a hurry to start their new jobs or to enroll their kids in schools. In their impatience, they end up bidding against one another for what units are available, which tend to be the unregulated ones. Those who succeed tend to be well-off.
In the larger market for older and regulated homes, the existing tenants initially seem to be the big winners. But the longer they stay, and the more their controlled rent diverges from market rates, the less incentive their landlords will have to maintain or renovate their crumbling properties.
Perversely, the biggest winners among the incumbent tenants tend to be affluent, because they live in homes whose rents would rise fastest in the absence of controls — in Berlin, for example, the luckiest will be those in elegant Wilhelmian digs in swanky Charlottenburg. Poor people in rent-controlled units, meanwhile, may be discouraged from seeking a better job elsewhere if they think they can no longer afford to move, and so become more likely to stay poor.
To make matters worse, the supply of rental homes in the regulated market actually shrinks, as landlords find it more profitable to convert and sell their units. Counterintuitively, then, rent controls benefit an ever-declining pool of lucky tenants at the expense of just about everyone else. It’s a boon for the rich and a bane for the poor, the young and new arrivals.
Discerning voters should call this out for what it is: left-wing populism, which offers simplistic answers to complex problems. Policy-makers should instead aim to make building new rental units more, rather than less, attractive. Sometimes that requires new zoning laws, to convert disused industrial areas into residential neighborhoods. Other times, it means cutting red tape and accelerating permitting. Almost always, it involves resisting the efforts of existing residents to block new construction.
But don’t be fooled: When people can’t afford to eat, the answer is not capped prices but more food. By the same token, wherever more people want to live, the answer is not rent controls but more housing.

Facebook Inc. could be forced to patrol its platform across the world to remove offensive and hateful posts by users in the European Union, in another potential landmark privacy ruling from the bloc’s top court.
Days after the EU Court of Justice decided against imposing a global “right to be forgotten” on Google Inc., its judges are set to rule Thursday on a parallel case that Facebook warns could threaten freedom of speech if a worldwide obligation to hunt down content is imposed on the company and other technology giants.
“Victims of such infringements often struggle with the fact that content is removed upon a notice, only to re-appear shortly after,” resulting in “an endless game of ‘whack-a-mole’, said Mirko Bruess, a lawyer with German law firm Waldorf Frommer. The court will decide how far Facebook’s obligations go to ensure such content stays away from its platform.
In a June opinion that was heavily criticized by Facebook, an adviser at the Luxembourg-based EU court said the social media giant could be ordered to remove offensive content posted by users in the EU and also look for similar posts worldwide. The EU’s law for digital services and electronic commerce “does not regulate the territorial scope” of such an obligation, according to Advocate General Maciej Szpunar’s advice.
The ruling “has potentially enormous repercussions for hosting and platform providers,” said Philip James, a technology lawyer with Sheridans in London.
“Whilst the current case focuses on hateful content, rather than copyright, there is a growing trend for the courts to fall favorably towards rights holders and those affected by hate speech,” said James. “There is a real likelihood therefore that Facebook may end up with a considerably greater burden to police its content than it currently has.”
Platforms from Facebook to Google’s YouTube won a nod of approval from the EU earlier this year for tackling hate speech posted online as part of a code of conduct signed with the commission in 2016. The companies vowed to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, once made aware of it.
Despite the platforms’ efforts, EU officials have been mulling new bloc-wide rules, building on existing legislation in Germany, that could hit big tech firms with possible fines if they fail to remove illegal hate speech quickly enough. The discussions fit into broader plans by the EU to overhaul liability rules for platforms.
The court’s ruling will also weigh how far the powers of national courts go in ordering global tech firms to remove posts. Facebook, in a statement on the court’s non-binding opinion in June, said that “the scope of court orders from one country must be limited to its borders.”
Facebook declined to add further comment ahead of Thursday’s decision.
Austria’s Supreme Court last year sought the EU judges’ guidance in a dispute between Facebook and Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, a former Green member of the European Parliament, who was the subject of a number of offensive posts on a Facebook user’s account. She asked for an order against the company to block any further publications of pictures of her if the text alongside them included similarly offensive content.
The Austrian court also asked whether under EU law companies could be forced to remove any content from its platform “with an equivalent meaning” to illegal information it has been made aware of. Lawyers said this is an issue also faced by copyright owners on platforms such as YouTube, or Instagram, where uploads of previously taken down copies keep popping up online.
Should the EU court find that Facebook “has a broad obligation to monitor its platform for repeated infringements” it could not only help victims of hate speech, but also affect “parties hurt by copyright or trade mark infringement online,” said Bruess.
The case is: C-18/18, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek v Facebook Ireland Limited.

Zhang’s lawyers will try to show at a trial set for Wednesday that his work at one of China’s most prestigious technical universities to develop radio-filtering technology used in mobile phones has always been about advancing scientific knowledge -- and not for the benefit of the Chinese state.
The trial comes amid an aggressive U.S. crackdown on Chinese theft of intellectual property that began under former President Barack Obama -- even before Zhang was arrested in 2015 when he flew to Los Angeles to attend a conference -- and has escalated during the Trump administration’s trade war with China.
Zhang could face a lengthy prison term in the U.S. if found guilty of trade-secret theft and an even more serious charge, economic espionage. Such cases rarely go to trial, but Zhang’s is even more unusual because he has elected to defend himself before a judge in federal court in San Jose, California, instead of in front of a jury.
The proceeding will last just one or two days, streamlined by the professor’s agreement not to fight evidence weighing against him that a federal prosecutor has described as “overwhelming.”
Zhang is mounting what one legal expert calls a “damage control” defense in which he has conceded evidence including emails that the U.S. says contained trade-secret data and admissions he made while being questioned by the FBI.
“It’s pretty common to only contest elements that are reasonably defensible, to avoid inflammatory or prejudicial evidence coming in on other elements that you are going to lose anyway, but which could color the rest of the case,” said Paul Chan, a lawyer who defends companies and individuals in trade-secret cases.

The secrets Zhang allegedly stole came from a former employer, Skyworks Solutions Inc., based in Woburn, Massachusetts, and San Jose-based Avago Technologies Ltd., which acquired Broadcom Inc. in 2015. The technology at issue filters out unwanted signals in mobile phones and other devices, which has become more difficult as wireless products have become ubiquitous.
Zhang went to work for Skyworks after earning his doctorate in electrical engineering at the University of Southern California in 2006. At USC he met Wei Pang, who went on to work at Avago and, according to prosecutors, was Zhang’s key co-conspirator. Both men returned to China to teach at Tianjin University, a premier technical school.
At TJU, the professors allegedly used stolen information to refine radio-filter technology, apply for patents in the U.S. and China, and sell it through a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
In 2015, prosecutor Matthew Parrella told the court that the U.S. has built an “overwhelming case” against Zhang based on email messages with Pang, in some instances containing proprietary information from Skyworks and Avago.
These Are Some of Trump’s Weapons in China Trade Spat: QuickTake
The government has proof of “overt act after overt act of this defendant emailing around trade secrets that he took, attempts to hide their business dealings, attempts to move the victim companies to China -- it’s extremely clear,” Parrella said.
Zhang is the first of six defendants to go to trial -- and probably the only one because the others are in China. U.S. District Judge Edward Davila has yet to rule on whether Zhang’s mentor at USC, Professor Eun Sok Kim, can testify about what Zhang’s lawyers call a practice at the school’s laboratory of promoting a “free and open exchange of ideas.”
Zhang “may be seeking to prove that, given the USC lab’s promotion of the ‘free and open exchange of ideas,’ he had no actual intent to benefit a foreign government,” Chan said. Prosecutors must prove the benefit to get enhanced penalties and fines under the economic espionage charge, he said.
Prosecutors have objected to the proposed testimony but apparently haven’t objected to Zhang’s request that Kim also serve as a character witness. The professor has testified once before, in 2015 shortly after Zhang was arrested, to vouch for his former student’s release on bail.
Kim said Zhang was a “reliable, conscientious person who never showed any sign of a deception.”
“He worked with me for four years as he pursued his Ph.D., so I know him quite well, on his personal integrity and his work ethics and his disposition and life objectives -- at least as far as I can tell while he was a student with me,” he said. “So I had a pretty good opinion about him.”
China’s Global Times daily newspaper has published numerous stories describing the plight of Chinese scientists, including Zhang, whose careers it says have been destroyed by U.S. prosecutions.
“America has a long history of hunting for Chinese scapegoats as part of their efforts to curb China’s scientific and technological development,” the English-language newspaper said in a December article.
The case is U.S. v. Hao Zhang, 15-cr-00106, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).

As China’s once-voracious companies retreat from the global property market, smaller neighbor South Korea is filling the void.
Korean investors splurged almost $6.8 billion on international commercial real estate in the year through August, according to CBRE Group Inc., more than four times the amount spent by Chinese firms.
And that’s before Seoul-based Mirae Asset Management Co. last month clinched an agreement to buy $5.8 billion of U.S. luxury hotels from China’s Anbang Insurance Group Co. in a deal emblematic of the shifting flow of capital emanating from the world’s most-populous continent.
Behind Korea’s rise as a global real-estate force is a pile of wealth that’s outgrown its home market. The nation’s asset-management industry has more than doubled over the past five years as the government encourages people to save more for their own retirement. A need to diversify beyond stocks and bonds, meanwhile, has encouraged the boom in outbound property deals stretching from San Francisco to Sydney.
“With the population aging and low interest rates persisting, demand for assets such as real estate is growing because people want to avoid the volatility in conventional assets like stocks and bonds,” said Jang Dong-hun, chief investment officer at Seoul-based Public Officials Benefit Association, which oversees about $11 billion. “But there aren’t lots of options at home, pushing investors to look abroad.”
South Korea overtakes China for global outbound commercial real estate deals

2019 data through August 
There’s often a mercurial element to commercial real estate investment. Skyline defining towers and historic landmarks regularly attract outsize prices as investors’ appetite for iconic assets outweighs a sober evaluation of likely returns. Such trophy hunting was a feature of China’s real estate binge, together with a willingness to take on risky developments.
Korean deal making has tended toward a more methodical approach that’s focused on achieving a cash-on-cash return of about 8% and a preference for long leases to strong tenants, according to Tris Larder, co-head of regional investment advisory for Savills Plc in EMEA.
Even with that hard-nosed approach, Korean investors have snapped up trophy office towers in Paris and Brussels, and are in talks for a major complex near Frankfurt airport. However, a growing lack of prime properties in Europe’s key markets, and competition among rival Korean investors that’s driving up prices, is forcing some to be more adventurous.
“There are limited properties with well-qualified tenants and established locations Korean investors are seeking,” said Shin Dong Chul, Seoul-based head of real estate at Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., which oversees about $95 billion. “Therefore, there’s a need for Korean investors to diversify their real estate assets in terms of regions and the type of assets.”
In June, Korea’s NH Investment & Securities Co. and Mirae Asset Daewoo Co. teamed with AIP Asset Management Inc. and the Valesco Group to buy the Twin City Tower in the Slovakian capital Bratislava for 122 million euros ($134 million). The building is leased to Amazon.com Inc.
Other investors have ventured into less liquid real estate markets including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. At the same time, falling interest rates in the U.S. are starting to lure Korean investors again as hedging costs come down.
“You get a lot more of a captive audience than you did six months ago,” said Brandon McMenomy, senior director of capital markets in the U.S. at CBRE. “The Koreans are experiencing great tailwinds at the moment and we’ve seen a material uptick in bid activity across the U.S.”
A group of Korean institutional investors bought a majority stake in AT&T Inc.’s global headquarters in Dallas, Bloomberg reported in September.
As in Europe, Korean investors are looking beyond America’s gateway cities in search of returns to match the pension liabilities of an increasingly elderly nation. That may not repeat the sugar rush caused by China’s real estate binge, particularly for prime property values. But it’s got investors hopeful there’s a new buyer in town.
“Momentum for the U.S. is strong from South Korea and we expect it to increase,” said Spencer Levy, CBRE’s chairman of Americas research. “We think the cycle will last for a lot longer than what people think.”"

Once the land of boring wine-by-the-glass reds, the country now rivals Napa, thanks to stylistic changes at iconic wineries—and some inventive moves by smaller upstarts.
 Quick, what’s your idea of Chilean wines? If you think they’re all ho-hum bar-wine cabernets and cheap sauvignon blancs with no taste thrills, you’re wrong.
Since the mid 2000s, the country has been in serious experimentation mode, from grape to glass.  The quality and diversity of its top wines has never been better.
That wasn’t what I found a couple of decades ago on my first visit to this skinny, 2,600-mile-long  country with great surfing along one of the world’s longest coastlines. The few so-called “icon” cuvées I tasted, such as Sena, Clos Apalta, Almaviva, and the top wines from Montes, were marketed internationally as cutting-edge and surprising. But I found they were mostly over-hyped beefy cabernets created to show that Chile could make big deal wines.
I wasn’t impressed with their oaky flavors and heavy handed winemaking. Most lacked flash, style, energy, and complexity and weren’t worth the high prices asked.
And sadly, almost all the country’s wines came from large, risk-averse wine companies with vineyards in the center of the country. They were churning out vats and vats of bland bargain wine.
Now all that’s changed—big-time.
The style of many icon wines started to change in the last decade amid criticism from wine critics and consumers, says Max Morales of wine marketing firm Andes Wines. Eduardo Chadwick, the owner of Viña Errazuriz, is one of those leading the transformation. His five top, or “icon,” wines now shine with bright, intense New World fruit and also subtlety, elegance, freshness, and finesse, rivaling big names in Napa and Bordeaux. In the past couple of years, he’s even branched out to top quality chardonnay and pinot noir.
At the same time, the country’s wine scene has grown way more diverse, inspiring dozens of new, delicious icons-in-the-making. Risk-taking young winemakers with boutique wineries are behind experiments with new grape varieties, new wine styles, and new zones in the far south, in Bio Bio and Itata along the cool Pacific coast, and in far north desert spots such as Elqui Valley, famous for star gazing, the grape brandy pisco, and New Age mysticism.
The retail-level image of the country’s wines, though, has yet to catch up to this exciting reality.
Here’s the backstory.
Chadwick, who helped bring his great-great-great grandfather’s 19th century winery back to life, was a poster boy for those initial icon wines. Among them are Seña, his joint venture with Robert Mondavi that Chadwick now owns, and Vinedo Chadwick, the most expensive wine in Chile, made from vines he planted in his father’s favorite polo field.
To prove how good the country’s wines could be, Chadwick began staging blind competitions of his cabernet-based icons against top Napa, Bordeaux, and Tuscan examples around the world. First came Berlin in 2004, then 21 other cities, including Tokyo, Beijing, and New York. To his surprise—or so he says—his came out tops.
But in 2008, his French winemaker started pushing to shift the style of the wines. The vines for Seña, from the vineyard in Aconcagua, are now grown biodynamically.  Grapes are picked nearly a month earlier, and in 2014 they began using 2,500-liter wooden vats (instead of smaller barrels) to age Vinedo Chadwick, so the flavor profile of the wine is less oaky. They hunted land near the cool Pacific coast for their new high-end pinot noir and chardonnay, looking for the bright acidity that cool climates preserve.
“Yes, icons were once exercises in excess, and today they’re more elegant,” says Canadian expatriate Derek Mossman Knapp, co-owner of Garage Wine Co. Still, he insists, “the real revolution in Chile is in southern regions like Maule and Itata, where people are beginning to make serious wines from recently discovered old vineyards of carignan, grenache, and cinsault and focusing on the terroir of individual sites.” In the 2016 vintage, Mossman made wines from 11 different vineyard parcels.
He’s a driving force behind the Alt-Chile movement that’s creating a different kind of icon wine. Small producers like him have banded together in impassioned movements with such names as MOVI, VIGNO, Chancho Deslenguados, and Brutall to champion organic and biodynamic farming,
The top vineyards were once clustered primarily in the center of the country near Santiago, often chosen for their convenience. As winemakers focused more on terroir and where specific grapes grow best, the country’s 350 wineries spread out over 2,000 miles, from north to south. It helps that one of the world’s great soil scientists, Pedro Parra, is Chilean.
In a land where cabernet used to be king (it still accounts for the majority of plantings), 88 other varieties are thriving, and the hot ones are cinsault, carignan, and grenache. (I was never a fan of carmenere, the grape Chileans once thought was merlot and then tried to push as the country’s national grape, but more and more producers have managed to tame its hard, green flavors.)
The country exports 80% of its production. To be sustainable, wineries need to charge more per bottle, which is why they have to upgrade the image of Chilean vino. Asia generally has embraced high-end Chilean wines, says Chadwick, who sells 50% of his production there, mostly cabernet and Bordeaux-style blends. The 2005 free trade agreement between Chile and China made it cheaper for Chilean wineries to sell there, and now it’s their No. 1 export destination.  And the wines are wildly popular in Japan and South Korea.
Will the U.S., the biggest wine market in the world, fall for the country’s new-style icon wines? I hope so. Here are nine to whet your appetite.
2016 Don Melchor Puente Alto ($100)Concha y Toro’s top red was the first icon wine in the Chilean industry, and this vintage is the 30th anniversary of its debut. Plush and concentrated, with velvety layers of mineral and fresh red-fruit flavors, this polished cabernet blend has a finish that lingers for more than a minute. It’s a lighter year, but decant it for a few hours before drinking.
2016 Vina Almaviva Puente Alto ($145)This cabernet blend, a collaboration between the Rothschilds of Bordeaux first-growth Mouton Rothschild and Concha y Toro, first debuted with the 1996 vintage, but has hit its stride in the past few vintages. Rich and spicy, with suave, silky tannins, it’s broader and riper than Bordeaux and more balanced and elegant than many Napa cabs. 
2016 Seña ($150) Founded in 1995 by Robert Mondavi and Eduardo Chadwick—and now owned by Chadwick—this is a complex blend of cabernet sauvignon, carmenere, merlot, cabernet franc, and petit verdot planted 60 miles north of Santiago in the Aconcagua Valley. For many years, it seemed to be trying to find its style. Now it has: This vintage from a cool year is soft, silky, and spicy, with chocolate-y notes.
2016 Vinedo Chadwick Maipo Valley ($325) This 100% cabernet sauvignon is Chile’s most expensive and elegant cabernet, and one of the two best. It’s much purer and more balanced than it used to be. Just outside Santiago, this 15-acre vineyard is near Almaviva’s and Don Melchor’s plantings.
2014 Garage Wine Co. Carignan Truquilemu Vineyard ($37) Canadian expat Derek Mossman Knapp is behind this revolutionary winery. He was among the first to see the potential of 100-year-plus dry-farmed vineyards of varieties such as carignan. This one, from a cold corner of Maule, has floral and herb aromas.
2017 Pedro Parra y Familia Wines Monk Cru ($45)Pedro Parra is a famous soil consultant, with clients all over the world. This is the first vintage of his new label, and he’s named the top wines, made from old vine cinsault, for his favorite jazz musicians—in this case, Thelonius Monk. Brimming with minerality, plus aromas of herbs and spices, this is an icon wine in the making. 
2014 Vinedos do Alcohuaz Rhu ($50) At 2,200 meters high in Elqui Valley, an area in northern Chile popular with stargazers and New Agers, the winery was founded in 2005. The blend is syrah, grenache, and petite syrah, fermented in stone lagars and crushed by foot. Spicy and intense, with notes of minerals, black olives, and dark plummy fruits, this is a wine that grabs you with the first sip.
2017 Errazuriz Les Pizarras Chardonnay ($80)The vineyard for Chadwick’s new, stunning white is six miles from the coast in Aconcagua Valley. This is the best chardonnay I’ve ever tasted from Chile. It has fresh mineral and lemon flavors and the depth of white Burgundy, with New World pizzazz.  
2013 VIK ($150) Founded in 2006 by a Norwegian entrepreneur, this ambitious winery in the Millahue Valley is a mix of cabernet sauvignon, carmenere, cabernet franc, and merlot. This vintage has more freshness and balance than earlier ones, as well as depth, power, and sophistication. It’s like a seductive mix of Napa and Bordeaux.

The agency, Ackerman McQueen, has said it can’t comply with the July 8 subpoena without first giving the NRA veto power over what it hands over, Attorney General Letitia James said in a lawsuit filed late Monday.
Ackerman McQueen, which helped shape the NRA’s mission for decades before a public split this year, told the attorney general it wants to comply with the subpoena but fears it’s legally required to allow the gun group to weigh in under a nondisclosure agreement, according to the filing.
The integrity of the probe “would be necessarily and irreparably compromised by allowing the investigative target to review, and potentially countermand, third parties’ prospective document productions,” the state said.

William Brewer, a lawyer for the NRA, said in an emailed statement that the organization has a right to redact privileged information in Ackerman McQueen’s documents, calling the practice a “tried and true approach” that’s routinely followed in such cases.
“This is not a dispute about whether Attorney General James can access NRA-related documents,” Brewer said. “It’s a dispute about whether she can do so secretly, in a manner designed to circumvent the NRA’s clear legal rights -- including the right to protect our members’ personal information from a political witch hunt.”

Turnaround efforts at GE meet economic headwinds, and its stock is left floundering.

Has it only been a year?
Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of General Electric Co.’s ouster of CEO John Flannery in favor of board member Larry Culp, an outsider respected for his operational prowess and dealmaking as the former head of Danaher Corp. It was an abrupt change for a company that usually moves at a glacial pace, but the prospect of a steep quarterly  operating loss in GE’s struggling power unit and a $22 billion goodwill writedown on the disastrous acquisition of Alstom SA’s energy assets convinced the board that Flannery wasn’t moving  nearly fast enough to save the company.  
It feels like much more time has passed since that fateful management switch, and that’s partly to Culp’s credit: He’s been much more aggressive and  decisive than his predecessor about divesting assets to shore up GE’s financial position, and he has  worked systematically to  refashion the board and instill a new operating ethos in the industrial businesses. Culp cut GE’s dividend,  started unwinding its stake in the Baker Hughes  energy business and  agreed to sell its biopharma operations to Danaher for $21.4 billion. Thus far, he’s managed to avoid the kind of massive surprise writedowns that marred Flannery’s tenure.

Culp’s furious pace of activity has helped stabilize GE, which is no small feat when you think back on the mess he inherited. But the stock is still lower than when he started and has stalled out at about $9 or $10. And at this point, most of the big, obvious buttons for change have been pushed. The company could sell its remaining health-care assets, although the fact that it’s scheduled an investor day focused on the business for December suggests it wants to keep that in the fold for now. A divestiture of its aircraft-lessor arm Gecas has been bandied about but is  highly difficult to execute in practice. And GE’s biggest demons – including  weak underlying  cash-flow capabilities and risky  black holes at GE Capital that despite Culp’s best efforts have at best turned a shade of mud-brown – have no quick fix.
There’s not much for Culp to do now other than grind it out on cost cuts and operational rigor, and cross his fingers that the industrial weakness that's emerged around the globe won’t get any worse. GE's pension and insurance liabilities are at risk of ballooning from the slump in interest rates. As such, Culp’s second year seems likely to be lighter on big announcements and highly dependent on the whims of the broader marketplace. A stock rally from here depends on investors taking the long view.
So far, they’ve been willing to accept any scrap of marginal good news as a sign of changing tides. Culp has somehow even managed to make the prospect of zero free cash flow from the industrial businesses this year feel like a win. But the path to a significant improvement in cash flow in 2020 and 2021 remains  highly murky in the best of times, and an outright fantasy in a recession environment. One of the more fascinating aspects of GE’s challenges is that they emerged at a time when other manufacturers were doing well. That’s changing: The Institute for Supply Management's gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity  fell deeper into a contraction in the month of September in the weakest reading since 2009. Meanwhile, a slowdown in the Chinese economy risks threatening even GE’s crown-jewel aviation unit.
GE upped its 2019 guidance for industrial free cash flow, in part because of what it said was a better-than-expected first-half performance.

NOTE: Data for guidance reflects the midpoint of the given range. GE now forecasts 2019 adjusted industrial cash flow between negative $1 billion and positive $1 billion. 
One thing that Culp does have control over is the company’s messaging. The biggest mistake of his tenure so far, in my opinion, has been his failure to do away with the myriad of opaque adjustments that have cluttered GE’s financial statements and presentations. For all Culp’s talk about 2019 being a “reset year,” this is the one thing he hasn’t been willing to reset and it has  cost the company some credibility. Culp hasn’t ignored investors’ calls for more transparency: The company hosted a so-called “teach-in” to educate investors on the vagaries of its long-term-care insurance business, for example, and gave cash-flow numbers for its operating units on an annual basis. But the disclosures tend to be  piecemeal, and when they do come are presented in a way that flatters the company or relies on overly optimistic assumptions. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Matt Levine recently flagged a paper that concluded at least some investors are misled by non-GAAP expense exclusions. He finds this theory frustrating for reasons you can read  here, but in the case of GE, it’s not hard for me to believe that it’s true.
GE is now on the hunt for a new chief financial officer, having announced in July that Jamie Miller would be stepping down from the job. Investors are focused on who the new hire could be and the prevailing thought is that Culp has to get someone with a big name and a respected background. Perhaps. But what he really needs someone who’s willing to reverse GE’s culture of carefully engineered earnings guidance and tell it straight to investors. A candidate concerned about guarding his or her hard-earned reputation might not be willing to do that, but it’s the kind of reckoning GE still needs.

A new round of China talks may come too late for Happy Gorilla
Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.  Sign up here. 
Happy Gorilla Game Studio was staring at ruin this summer even before its first board game was unloaded off the boat from China.
Chip Boyd and Neil Gilstrap, co-founders of the crowd-funded startup in the niche world of Dungeons and Dragons-style pastimes, had promised backers early copies of War for Indagar, a demon-laden fantasy.
They hadn’t anticipated tariffs on Chinese imports. As they waited for their boards, special dice and figurines of the Bright Lord and Grinning Tyrant to arrive, they feared they would have to ask backers for more money, eat the $4,300 in tariffs themselves or roll the costs into their next project and potentially doom it.
“There was very little chance of digging out of that hole,” said Boyd, who is based in Virginia.
Businesses across America are straining to cope with  import taxes and protectionism under the Trump administration, which next week hosts senior Chinese officials for the highest level talks since July — and just days before another threatened tariff increase.
For Happy Gorilla, a company built on fun, the levies meant a joyless summer. Elsewhere, an Italian manufacturer of factory machinery bought a Colorado subsidiary to ensure a toehold in the market. A crib manufacturer dumped parts of its product line that no longer made financial sense. And a decor-maker in California hunted for elusive upside.
Some U.S. businesses are warning they may close if they don’t get a yearlong reprieve, or “exclusion,” from tariffs that by year-end may touch some $500 billion in Chinese imports, said Paula Connelly, a Boston trade lawyer.
“It’s going to be hard to say no to someone who says, ‘Unless I get this exclusion, I’m gong to have to shut down,’” Connelly said.
Bloomberg spoke with companies across the country to see how they’re coping with uncertainty.
Colossal video games like Fortnite grab attention, but lower-tech gamers are up all night playing things like War for Indagar. Hobbyists have backed them to the tune of $700 million since 2009, Kickstarter reports, and games are the crowdfunding platform’s biggest category by dollars pledged.
Ultimately, Happy Gorilla escaped its fate when President Donald Trump  delayed tariffs on some consumer products until Dec. 15, and the company has been sending copies to supporters at the promised price. Still, the industry fears that a 15% tariff set to hit toys and other consumer goods in December, may later rise to 30%. “It changes week to week, kind of on a whim,” said Scott Gaeta of San Diego, California-based Renegade Game Studios.
A 30% tariff could cripple games, which typically sell for $40 or $50, Gaeta said. Renegade is ordering extra copies of its best-selling titles for storage ahead of the December tariffs, such as the medieval village-building game Architects of the West Kingdom. Others are considering delaying or nixing new games with lots of miniature plastic pieces, which carry higher price points and thus more risk.
Renegade is a midsize studio and will ride out the tariffs, but smaller shops “might not be working on the best margins to begin with. Tack on these tariffs, and you’ll have a lot of them underwater,” Gaeta said.
Last year, executives at SCM Group S.p.A., an Italian manufacturer of furniture-making machines, heard the tough talk with alarm: Trump was threatening retaliation against the European Union over what he saw as unfair trade. Meanwhile, domestic cabinet makers were pressing the International Trade Commission to punish Chinese cabinet makers for what they said was dumping in the U.S.
SCM makes many of its computerized cutting devices in Rimini, a picturesque town on the Adriatic Sea. Spooked, SCM last October purchased a Colorado company that also makes routers, Diversified Machine Systems, for an undisclosed sum. The move lets the Italian firm target new industries, offer cheaper machines — SCM’s average order price is around $150,000 — and reduce foreign-exchange risks. But it also gave it a hedge against the unknown.
Its new American unit can be a base for future expansion, “and it makes us more independent from the risk of an increase in export duties,” Chief Executive Officer Andrea Aureli said by email.
Other foreign companies are considering similar moves, said John Ling, a consultant from Greenville, South Carolina, who helps Chinese companies invest in U.S. factories. Ling is fielding many more calls lately from companies considering a presence. Holding them back: worry over the Trump administration’s moves to curb immigration and foreign visas.
Some 90% of safety-related baby gear comes from Asia, mostly from China, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association. The U.S. Trade Representative left car seats off the tariff list after makers argued parents would use outdated models. But companies like Vancouver-based Storkcraft Manufacturing Inc. are stumped by the decision to keep cribs — a key safety concern among parents.
“It doesn’t make sense to me,” said Adam Segal, the chief executive officer.
With sales north of $100 million, Storkcraft sells furniture and cribs under its own brand online and in big-box retailers, and produces Graco-branded products. It has tried to find suppliers outside China, “but it is difficult, if not impossible, to replicate the infrastructure, safety and capacity,” Segal said.
For now, it has bumped up the price of a popular $199 crib by $40 apiece and seen sales of some models decline. It has discontinued products that weren’t selling at the new, higher price points, he said. Some manufacturers are petitioning for a one-year reprieve, said Lisa Trofe, managing director of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
Jonathan Bass got an eight-year head start on shifting production out of China, but while everyone else races to Vietnam and Malaysia, he moved closer to home. His company, PTM Images, designs mirrors, frames and wall art for retailers such as TJ Maxx and Bloomingdale’s from its studio in West Hollywood, California. Bass had sourced goods from China until 2011, when he grew dismayed at his supplier’s willingness to skirt California’s environmental regulations. That year, he opened his own factory in a Mexican border town south of Arizona.
The move yielded shorter shipping times, but his worker costs have been higher than they would’ve been in China, even with the latter country’s run-up in wages. Bass pays his workers around $4.50 an hour, where comparable workers in China might expect $3.60, according to market researcher Euromonitor. Bass also wasn’t expecting energy costs in Mexico to be as high as they are, and so he schedules shifts during off-peak power usage times.
“You can’t play low-cost in Mexico in comparison to low-cost in China or low-cost in Vietnam,” Bass said.
Bass has tried to improve his margins by adding production of high-end furniture, under the Badgley Mischka brand, at his Mexican wall decor factory. Meantime, he sees the 25% duties on Chinese furniture and wall decor as putting his factory on a even footing, even if China’s moves to devalue its currency offset some tariffs.
“It makes everyone more competitive, but the issue is, are they staying?” Bass said. “Will there be a flip-flop? No one is secure in the direction of where we’re going.”

There’s an “uneven playing field” in financial markets for individual investors getting into the products, Won Seung-yeon, senior deputy governor of Financial Supervisory Service, told reporters Tuesday. They may not be fully informed that the derivatives carry the risk of buyers losing almost all their money.

There were problems in product design, manufacture and sales of derivative-linked securities or funds tied to overseas rates, including sellers giving improper advice, not following sales procedures, and a lack of risk management and internal controls, Won said at a briefing on interim findings of its probe.
Individual investors hunting for higher returns as interest rates dropped in Korea were the predominant buyers of the derivative products, and the elderly made up a significant portion, regulators’ data suggest. Non-professional investors comprised 98.9% of the about 795 billion won ($663 million) of overseas rate-linked products outstanding as of Aug. 7, and people 60 or older made up about 44% of the total, according to FSS data.
The regulator is continuing to investigate whether products were sold without enough information provided to buyers or whether they had design flaws, and will further probe Woori Bank and Hana Bank, both of which sold the products, Won said.
Hana Bank apologized to its customers that suffered losses from so-called DLS tied to overseas rates, and it will seek various measures to protect investors, the lender said in a statement Tuesday. Woori Bank also said in a statement last week that it will actively seek ways to protect its customers in dispute reconciliation.

Six months ago, Russia adopted a law making it an administrative offense to insult the government on the internet. The first results of its application are in, and in a majority of the cases where a court imposed a fine, Russians have been punished for insulting President Vladimir Putin.  
Instead of sheltering Putin and other top officials from harsh and vulgar criticism, however, the use of the Russian lèse majesté law –the first one adopted since the Soviet Union fell apart – has resulted in a bizarre price list of insults. On average, it costs 30,000 rubles ($462) to revile the president.
After Putin signed the law in March, local police, prosecutors and courts started using it to deter disrespectful speech about all kinds of officials – mayors, governors, even the managers of a state-owned company. The Kremlin and the Russian parliament were dismayed, and in July, Putin asked his prosecutor general to monitor the emerging cases. Soon afterward, the Interior Ministry instructed police to use the law only against people using particularly insulting language and images with regard to Putin, the cabinet, the parliament and the courts. 
According to a report from Agora, a group of Russian human rights lawyers, out of a total of 45 cases opened under the new law, 26 involved Putin, and 18 of these ended in a legally binding ruling imposing a fine. 
According to Agora, the first case successfully prosecuted under the lèse majesté law involved Roman Vatanen from the town of Kalevala in the northwestern region of Karelia. He posted a series of memes on the social network Vkontakte describing Putin as a thief, and some of his billionaire friends as “parasites” and “devils.” He was sentenced to a 30,000 ruble fine on April 24.
The best-known conviction was that of Yury Kartyzhev in Nizhnyaya Vishera in the Novgorod region, also in the northwest of Russia, who described Putin using a vulgar reference to the sex act in a Vkontakte post that has become an internet meme. Kartyzhev was fined 30,000 rubles in April but rewarded by a huge flash mob in his support.  According to the Sova Center, a Russian human rights nonprofit group, at least three people were punished for responding to that post with their own Putin insults; they likely assumed that Kartyzhev had too many supporters for all of them to be prosecuted.  For example, in July, Igor Gorlanov from the Siberian mining city of Novokuznetsk was fined 30,000 rubles for quoting Kartyzhev and linking to a video of Putin explaining that Russians were free to say anything on the internet.
Though 30,000 rubles is the most widespread fine, there is some variation. A court in the Arkhangelsk region in northern Russia fined Georgiy Minyayev 15,000 rubles for calling Putin a “retard” on Vkontakte, in reference to a video of the Russian president driving a truck on the newly-built bridge to Russian-annexed Crimea. It wasn't Putin’s destination that had angered Minyayev, but his failure to put on a seat belt and his likely lack of a truck driver’s license.
It cost Yevgeny Zhukov from Kurgan, just east of the Ural Mountains, 40,000 to post a taunting anti-Putin song often sung by Ukrainian soccer fans. And last week, Alexey Bychkov from Oryol in southern Russia, was sentenced to the same amount for calling Putin a “condom” in a post about ticks; Bychkov claimed the bloodsucking arachnids weren’t widespread in his part of the country before, but that their prevalence today is a sign of a declining quality of life under Putin.
The Kremlin likes to present anti-Putin protests as the whining and hand-wringing of Moscow and St. Petersburg students and intellectuals. But the people sentenced under the law have been ordinary people from Russia’s poorer regions; a couple had previous criminal convictions, the majority are blue-collar workers. The geography and demographics of the convictions show anger against Putin is bubbling right below the surface in places that routinely “vote” for the president in elections widely seen as rigged.
Asked in June why he’d signed the law into effect, Putin referred to similar laws in European countries, specifically Germany. That country does make it illegal to defame its president (though not the more powerful chancellor) – but the offense can only be prosecuted with the president’s own authorization, and that has happened only a few times in modern history. For example, a man was fined 600 euros ($654) in 2011 for throwing two eggs at President Christian Wulff. 
A similar law also exists in France: In 2013, a left-wing activist, Hervé Eon, was sentenced to a suspended fine of 30 euros for waving an insulting placard at President Nicolas Sarkozy.  But then the European Court of Human Rights overturned the French court’s ruling. Some of the Russians sentenced under the lèse majesté law plan to appeal their fines human-rights court, too.
No democratic nation tries to protect its leader’s image by hunting down the writers of irreverent social network posts. Authoritarian ones like Russia should drop the practice, too. The cases do nothing to extinguish popular anger. Even when human rights organizations are forced to describe the “offenses” elliptically, as is the case in Russia, the court rulings only help turn the authoritarian leader into a laughingstock. And the more people laugh, the closer the day when there are too many voices of protest to be silenced.

Collins was charged last year with passing non-public information about Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., an Australian biotechnology company, to his son. The lawmaker was arrested in August 2018 along with the son, Cameron Collins, and Stephen Zarsky, the father of Cameron’s fiancee. Prosecutors said the case was the first in which insider-trading charges were brought against a sitting member of Congress.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill said on Monday that her office had received a letter from Collins and that his resignation would take effect Tuesday.
Democrats could use the Collins case as they build their argument against the GOP in the 2020 election. But more narrowly his resignation could help Republicans hold the district by removing Collins as an issue. Though he won re-election while under indictment by only 1,000 votes, it’s a heavily Republican district made up of areas surrounding Buffalo and Rochester in western New York.
There are no constitutional provisions or House rules that require a member to forfeit his or her seat after a felony conviction. But the lawmaker, who had already been stripped of his committee assignments, would no longer have been able to vote in Congress.
Collins, who’d claimed that seizures of evidence from his staff by law-enforcement authorities had violated his constitutional rights, is scheduled to change his plea to guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday, according to court documents. His son and Zarsky are scheduled to plead guilty on Thursday.
James Margolin, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, declined to comment on the planned guilty pleas. Lawyers for the three defendants didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment. Collins’s office declined to comment and referred calls to his attorney.
Collins was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump in the 2016 election. Last week, he took to Twitter to criticize the announcement by House Democrats that they’re pursuing an impeachment investigation of the president, calling it a “witch hunt.”
A judge ruled this month against a request by Collins to review materials he said would show that investigators breached a constitutional provision limiting official inquiries into legislative matters. He’d moved to appeal the ruling, claiming that the evidence seizures violated the Speech or Debate Clause, which protects members of Congress from arrest and prosecution based on their political views.
The three defendants were scheduled to go to trial Feb. 3.
Prosecutors claimed Collins tipped off his son about negative results in a clinical trial for a drug being developed by Innate Immunotherapeutics to treat a form of multiple sclerosis. Collins, one of the company’s largest shareholders, served on the board and had access to non-public information.
His son then passed the news to his girlfriend, his girlfriend’s mother, Zarsky and a friend, prosecutors said. In the four days before the negative drug news was announced, they and others sold more than 1.78 million Innate shares, avoiding losses of about $768,000, according to prosecutors.
The case is U.S. v. Collins, 18-cr-567, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

President Donald Trump unleashed a torrent of tweets over the weekend attacking Democrats and demanding to meet the whistle-blower who said the president asked Ukraine’s president to dig up political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
The president is portraying himself as the victim, the subject of two partisan “witch hunts” to oust him, and urging his loyal base to punish his opponents at the polls.
Here are the latest developments:
Former White House adviser Steve Bannon said it was a “terrible precedent” for the White House to made public the records of the telephone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, which is now at the heart of Democratic impeachment efforts.
“You can’t have these transcripts and continue to conduct foreign policy,” Bannon said during an appearance Monday on the Fox Business Network. He said that while he was at the White House, the administration moved to reduce access to records of leader-to-leader phone calls after the Washington Post obtained transcripts of calls between Trump and then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Enrique Pena Nieto, who was then the president of Mexico.
Bannon also suggested that the administration should consider “alternatives” to “slow down” the impeachment process, adding that the White House should demand similar investigations into the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. He also called for a look into Biden’s foreign policy toward Ukraine and China, suggesting without evidence that the former vice president took softer stances for the personal benefit of his family.
“If they want sunshine, I say bring it,” Bannon said.
Bannon, who was ousted from the administration in 2017 amid clashes with other senior officials, said he believed the current White House team -- including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, and press secretary Stephanie Grisham -- were equipped to handle the impeachment inquiry.
Responding to questions from top Republican lawmakers, the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community said Monday that the whistle-blower’s complaint was handled properly and that the law does not require first-hand knowledge for such complaints.
The whistle-blower report that sparked an impeachment inquiry bases some allegations against Trump on information allegedly provided by other administration officials. Statements about a July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president have since been corroborated by a partial transcript of the call.
“The ICIG reviewed the information provided as well as other information gathered and determined that the complaint was both urgent and that it appeared credible,” Inspector General Michael Atkinson said in a statement. He said the whistle-blower followed correct procedures in submitting forms to lodge his or her complaint.
The comments come after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy signed a letter to Atkinson asking about recent changes to forms used to facilitate whistle-blower complaints. A similar letter was sent by Republican senators. Trump’s defenders have tried to dismiss the whistle-blower’s report as “hearsay.”
Atkinson said references to first-hand knowledge on previous versions of the whistle-blower forms were removed because they “could be read – incorrectly – as suggesting that whistle-blowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees.”
The Pentagon’s inspector general is weighing a request from seven Senate Democrats asking for a review of why Ukrainian military aid was frozen over the summer before the Trump administration freed $250 million authorized and appropriated by Congress.
The watchdog is reviewing the Sept. 25 letter by lawmakers including Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, vice chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee, spokeswoman Dwrena Allen said via email.
Among the questions the senators posed to Inspector General Glenn Fine: “Was the department directed to slow or halt its work to spend the funds and was the department prohibited from communicating this to Congress?” --Tony Capaccio
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo took part in Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president, the Wall Street Journal reported. Pompeo brushed off the Ukraine whistle-blower’s complaint at a brief news briefing on Friday in New York, saying he hadn’t read the report and criticizing a reporter for raising the question.
Officials at the State Department didn’t immediately respond to a questions about Pompeo’s role. --Nick Wadhams
Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was subpoenaed Monday to provide documents to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, as the impeachment inquiry into the president accelerates.
Three House panels said Giuliani has claimed to have text messages, phone records and other communications regarding requests for the government of Ukraine to target Biden. They set an Oct. 15 deadline.
”Our inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the president in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President,” the chairmen wrote in their letter. -- Erik Wasson
Trump again suggested Ukraine may have intervened in the 2016 U.S. election, one day after his former homeland security adviser said the conspiracy had been “completely debunked.”
”The new president of Ukraine ran on the basis of no corruption. That’s how he got elected. And I believe that he really means it, but there was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election against us,” Trump said Monday at the White House. “And we want to get to the bottom of it, and it’s very important that we do.”
Trump has repeatedly suggested -- including in his controversial phone call with Zelenskiy -- that Ukraine or Ukrainian actors were in some way involved in the breach of a Democratic National Committee server in 2016 or the subsequent investigation of that crime.
Thomas Bossert, who served as Trump’s first homeland security adviser, said Sunday he told the president there was no basis to his theory that Ukraine was involved and added that he was “deeply disturbed” that Zelenskiy was asked to investigate the conspiracy in the leader-to-leader phone call.
“It is completely debunked,” Bossert said in an interview on ABC News’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”
“I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president,” Bossert said. “It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again, and for clarity here, George, let me just again repeat that it has no validity.” -- Justin Sink
Americans are evenly divided, 47-47%, on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released Monday.
A Quinnipiac poll published on Sept. 24, just before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry, showed 37% backing impeachment and removal, and 57% in opposition.
The new support in Monday’s poll comes largely from Democrats, who are now 90% in favor of impeachment and removal to 5% against. Last week, they were 73%-21% in favor of impeachment. -- Gregory Korte
Democratic Senator Mark Warner warned that President Donald Trump’s attacks on an intelligence community whistle-blower is a threat to both government accountability and national security.
The ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee said on Twitter that the president’s “comments about ‘spies and treason’ and ‘what we used to do in the old days’ are totally unacceptable and will do serious damage far beyond this news cycle.” Warner, of Virginia, said the integrity of the whistle-blower process must be protected and that the onslaught from Trump and his allies “needs to end immediately.”
Warner was responding to several tweets from Trump over the past 24 hours that suggested a whistle-blower who raised alarms about the president’s conversation with the leader of Ukraine was “spying” on him and demanded that he should be allowed to meet his accuser. -- Laura Litvan
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the GOP-led Senate won’t maneuver for a way to avoid a trial of charges against Trump if the House approves articles of impeachment against him.
Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” McConnell said Senate rules require the Senate to take up House-approved articles of impeachment that are presented. He has no interest in trying to change the rules, and he said it would take 67 votes to do it. That would be a tall order in a chamber that Republicans control with just 53 votes.
“I would have no choice but to take it up,” McConnell said. “How long you’re on it is a whole different matter.” -- Laura Litvan
Two senior Republicans are asking the Justice Department for information about Joe Biden’s interactions with Ukrainian officials and whether Ukraine worked with Democrats to get damaging information on President Donald Trump’s election campaign.
Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley and Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson made the request as Trump and his allies try to turn the tables on an investigation by House Democrats into allegations that the president pressured Ukraine’s leader to investigate Biden, one of his chief political rivals.
As Democrats begin an official impeachment inquiry into Trump, the president has raised discredited claims about Biden’s involvement in stopping a probe into his son’s work in Ukraine and allegations that the Democratic Party in 2016 worked with Ukrainian officials to discover ties between Trump, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is now in prison, and Russian figures.
“Ukrainian efforts, abetted by a U.S. political party, to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored. Such allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempt to undermine our democratic processes,” the senators wrote in a letter to Attorney General William Barr. -- Joe Sobczyk
Former GOP Senator Jeff Flake urged his former colleagues to stand up to Trump and condemn his behavior as wrong in an op-ed published in the Washington Post.
Flake wrote that impeachment is divisive and presents a tough decision for senators who could have to vote on whether to remove the president from office if the House votes to impeach him. Flake said impeachment “now seems inevitable,” and the resulting division in the country could end up benefiting Trump politically.
However, should Trump survive the impeachment inquiry, Flake said it should be an easy decision for Republicans to decide not to support him for re-election in 2020. Flake said he decided not to run for re-election in 2018 because he could not stand behind Trump in the way that many GOP voters now demand of their elected representatives.
“My fellow Republicans, it is time to risk your careers in favor of your principles,” Flake wrote. “Trust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job. But you cannot go elsewhere for a soul.” -- Anna Edgerton

The streaming giant’s programming budget is set to exceed $14 billion this year and some of that money is flowing into non-English content to keep its international audience growing. Sometimes, those investments turn into money-spinning hits outside their home market, as happened in the U.S. with Spanish heist drama “La Casa de Papel.”
Netflix Threatens U.K. TV’s Home Advantage With Production Drive
“Soon enough, half of the U.S. population will speak Spanish, so we’re focusing on acquisition targets,” Mediawan Chairman Pierre-Antoine Capton said in an interview in Paris. “We need to be present in Spain since it’s in the middle of a development boom.”
He said Mediawan is in “advanced talks” with Spanish production firms and hopes to announce a deal by year-end.
Mediawan was launched in 2017 by Capton, Niel and Lazard Ltd. banker Matthieu Pigasse. This year it bought Italy’s Palomar, producer of a TV version of Umberto Eco’s medieval theology and crime novel “The Name of the Rose.”
Call my Agent
Its big hit at home is “Call My Agent,” a star-studded comedy series about a French movie talent agency. Netflix snapped up three seasons of the show for international distribution and Mediawan has sold adaptation rights for the U.K., Italy and Canada. It’s now in talks to sell the rights in the U.S. and China.
Mediawan aims to replicate the success with animated franchise ‘Miraculous,’ though it could take years to build an established brand across the continent. Pouring money into content assets can be risky in an industry where one failure can wipe out profits.
Niel, Capton and Pigasse each own 6.7% of Mediawan’s shares. Ties between Niel and Pigasse have been strained by disagreements about another of their investments, newspaper Le Monde, after Pigasse sold his 49% stake in the national daily to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.
At Mediawan, they seem to be getting along fine.
“The three of us met because we shared a vision that the value of content was booming,” Capton said. “We had a board meeting on Thursday, the three of us were present and everything is going well.”

For 60 years, the puffer has remained true to the coat that George Finch, an Australian chemist and mountaineer, designed for Edmund Hillary’s ascent of Mount Everest in 1953. Sometimes called quilted jackets, they’re filled with down insulation between rows of stitching that give them the look—and, crucially, the warmth—of sleeping bags with arms.
But today the winter staple can be just as fashionable as a tailored suit. This season, Moncler collaborated with the Queen of England’s favorite designer, Richard Quinn, on a lively collection with leopard and daisy prints. Perfect Moment, a ski brand born in Chamonix, France, adds a chic houndstooth pattern to its colorful, retro-inspired lineup. “With the advancement of ‘faux down’ and new breathable tech fabrics,” says the brand’s creative director Jane Gottschalk, “we are able to create the same degree of warmth in a slimmer-fit jacket.”
Even labels not usually affiliated with ski season are jumping on board. Tory Burch has introduced reversible options covered with paisley, while Saint Laurent has one for men that looks more like a varsity jacket.
Casey Cadwallader, creative director of Mugler and head of design for skiwear upstart Aztech Mountain, says these slimmer coats are “easier to layer with and to pack.” The Aztech Mountain client is a “discerning skier who wants the best garment performance on the slopes,” he says, “and appreciates that a refined design can also work in the city.”
For almost 25 years, the Perfect Moment has been creating clothing for the most extreme skiers with a focus on performance and design. This houndstooth jacket will be available on Oct. 21.  Similar styles from $490
The Elk Mountain puffer from Aztech Mountain, co-owned by skiing legend Bode Miller, is made with 420 grams of goose down and stays warm to –10F. A three-way adjustable hood and extendable storm visor further protect against wintry elements.  $750
The Mary, a women’s jacket from the 0 Moncler Richard Quinn line, pays tribute to exuberant femininity. The combination of prints—leopard outside and floral inside—embodies the playfulness Quinn is known for.  $2,165
The 20-year-old Canadian outerwear brand Mackage this year debuted its women’s Elita-NF (no fur) jacket in red (available Oct. 18). It comes with a generous hood and a belt that cinches at the waist.  Similar styles from $850
This army-green men’s puffer from Saint Laurent has a cupro and cotton lining and hides a hood inside its high collar. The ribbed wrists and waistband give it a varsity-jacket vibe.  $2,590
Mammut’s IN Anorak combines a shiny surface in gold or silver with a 90-10 ratio of down to feathers. Its sleeve cuffs have a rubber band on the inside to stay snug. $800

Turkish troops moved into northeastern Syria to force back Kurdish militants controlling the border area, days after Donald Trump said the U.S. wouldn't stand in the way. A small forward group of Turkish forces first entered the country this morning at two points along the frontier. Kurdish-led forces called on fighters to head for the frontier to defend the region.

China is still open to a limited trade deal with the U.S. as long as no more tariffs are imposed, an official said. In return, it's offering to boost American soybean purchases by half to 30 million tons a year, the FT reported. Beijing may be focused on limiting the damage to its economy, but negotiators heading to Washington for trade talks tomorrow aren't optimistic a broad agreement can be reached to end the war outright. 
Brexit latest: Scottish judges held off intervening in the furor by postponing a decision on whether the government needed to commit to sending a letter requesting an extension. Parliament will sit on Saturday, Oct. 19, to discuss Brexit following an EU Council meeting. The session is set to be fraught as lawmakers weigh options that include trying to delay Brexit, crashing out with no deal or bringing down the government. Follow the action with our Brexit Update.
Two people were killed after shots were fired near a synagogue in Halle, Germany, the AP reported. Police said the suspects fled in a car and soon after reported that one person had been arrested. They urged residents to stay at home or indoors. Local media reported attacks at two other locations, including the use of an explosive at the city's Jewish cemetery. Wednesday is the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.

The Swiss lender is considering a return to the country's U.S. wealth management after a four-year absence as CEO Tidjane Thiam seeks to boost growth in private banking. Talks have focused on adding $15 billion of AUM at a new base in Miami, mostly catering to wealthy Latin Americans, people familiar said.
Spain's acting prime minister has pledged to take steps toward ending the long-standing political stalemate and forming a government following next month's parliamentary election. Pedro Sanchez didn't say what his proposal will focus on, but the prospect of a solution by December may help restore confidence in a country battered by uncertainty.
Boris Johnson spent the past week hinting that he'd be prepared to defy the law by refusing to request a third Brexit extension, David Fickling writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Now, he's challenging the queen to a constitutional duel. A precedent from Australia shows the British monarch doesn't have to sit by meekly.
The key question for the world economy remains whether President Trump will finally decide to change course and pull back from protectionism, writes Bloomberg Opinion's Ferdinando Giugliano. Until there's a truce in trade wars, uncertainty will continue and economic growth will suffer. You don't realize just how good the gains from globalization are until you've lost them.
Greta Thunberg risks her climate movement and alienating political allies by teaming up with extremists, Leonid Bershidsky writes for Bloomberg Opinion. There's a distinction between encouraging school strikes and the more radical actions promoted by Extinction Rebellion. She appears to have crossed the line between eliciting sympathy and emanating menace.

As Netflix, Amazon and Apple sap viewers from traditional TV, one German broadcaster is fighting back—with a green-suited grasshopper and a fuzzy pink monster. The Masked Singer, a mashup of game show and talent competition that ProSiebenSat.1 aired this summer, probably won't win any Emmys. But these are tough times for traditional broadcasters, and many have concluded that non-scripted TV is their best defense.

After two boom-and-busts, the Swiss ski resort of Andermatt used to be little more than a ghost town high in a secluded pocket of the Alps. Then Egyptian real estate mogul Samih Sawiris proposed an audacious plan, one that would see more than $1 billion go into an opulent hotel and golf course, a revamped and expanded ski area, and an ambitious development of holiday apartments and private chalets.

Switzerland’s Andermatt has all the makings of an ultra-luxury ski destination.
The first time Egyptian real estate mogul Samih Sawiris took a helicopter ride over the sleepy Swiss ski village of Andermatt, 14 years ago, he was struck by its remote wildness. The resort was only a 90-minute drive from Zurich, yet it felt like a secret hidden in the mountains of Uri, arguably the rugged country’s least discovered canton.
What the silver-haired chairman of Orascom Development Holding AG must have also seen was a blank slate. The appeal of European ski resorts, unlike that of their purpose-built American counterparts, is their sense of history. Think skiing into farming villages steeped in tradition, where the slopes and hotels and restaurants have been attracting winter tourists for—in some cases—well over a century.
Andermatt offered exactly the opposite. This was a resort that, after two boom-and-bust cycles, felt virtually empty, a veritable ghost town notched high up in a secluded pocket of the Alps. History hadn’t been kind to the valley. First the Gotthard Tunnel rerouted the railway tourists who’d once stopped here during the belle epoque. Then the Swiss military, who’d made Andermatt a big base of operations, pulled out in the 1990s, leaving the resort a husk of its former self. All that remained was a picturesque main street flanked by timber chalets and old hotels and a few antiquated lifts ferrying skiers to the tops of the towering mountains that encircle the town. No-frills free riders came for the plentiful powder and off-piste faces lining the Gemsstock, the highest lift-serviced peak in the area, but they didn’t do much for the local economy when it came to spending money in town.
To Sawiris—whose holdings include El Gouna, an Egyptian resort town along the Red Sea with some 20,000 residents—the underdeveloped resort’s lack of infrastructure marked its appeal.
“Mr. Sawiris doesn’t only create tourism destinations, he creates towns,” says Stefan Kern, a spokesman for Andermatt Swiss Alps AG, the company Sawiris founded to transform Andermatt from a down-on-its-luck Alpine hamlet into a destination resort capable of rivaling Zermatt, St. Moritz, and Verbier.
In 2007, Sawiris proposed an audacious three-pronged resuscitation plan, one that would see more than $1 billion go toward an opulent luxury hotel and 18-hole Scottish-style golf course, a revamped and expanded ski area, and an ambitious development of holiday apartments and private chalets. To succeed at that third component—the one most critical to his bottom line—Sawiris had to find a way around a Swiss law that restricted foreigners from purchasing second homes. He did just that, getting the government to grant Andermatt an exemption as a special economic development zone. Once the town voted in favor of his plan, almost unanimously, Sawiris was off and running.
Spread out across nine peaked-roof chalets, the five-star 169-room Chedi opened its doors in 2013 and now forms the heart of the new Andermatt. The hotel has become a destination in and of itself for moneyed travelers—some skiers, some not—who want to unplug amid blissed-out luxury in the seclusion of the Swiss Alps. During a visit in early April, as the snow still dumped outside, an international array of guests milled about the sleek black-stone and timber lobby, ate farm-fresh breakfasts in the 250-person dining room beside an open kitchen, and floated downstairs to spa appointments. There’s a 6,000-bottle wine cellar, plus a Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant (a 10-course kaiseki menu is recommended) and, for those who can afford further seclusion, the two-floor Furka suite, which comes replete with a private spa and rents for $15,000 a night.
Still, despite its sheer size and over-the-top amenities, the Chedi doesn’t dominate Andermatt. Nor does Sawiris’s residential development on the north side of town, Andermatt Reuss, which is home to the recently opened four-star Radisson Blu hotel, a 650-seat classical music concert hall, and apartment buildings surrounding a central piazza. (Eighty percent of finished apartments have already been sold.) Instead, as you drive up the circuitous bends and through a crack in the mountains and into town, you’re greeted by the broad valley’s open snowfields, a few remaining military barracks, perhaps a red train trundling along on your right-hand side, and serrated peaks in every direction.
“Some people driving into the village don’t even realize the Chedi is there,” says Mari Russi, co-owner of Art 87 Andermatt, a contemporary gallery located just off the cobblestones of Gotthardstrasse. The hotel’s entrance “is very discreet. There’s no big sign—you really have to look for it.”
Russi hails from Sweden, but it was her Swiss husband, Bernhard Russi—Andermatt Swiss Alps board member and winner of the 1972 Olympic downhill—who introduced her to his hometown more than 30 years ago. A lot has changed since then, but like most locals she takes an all-ships-rise attitude toward Sawiris’s development. Now her clients are the type of people who won’t bat an eye at the $50,000 price tags of her gallery’s most expensive pieces.
“Everyone is happy the Chedi is here,” says Louie Gougouth, assistant manager at the Hotel Sonne, a 150-year-old family-owned institution that remains perhaps the most picturesque building in town. Originally from Morocco, Gougouth came to Switzerland to study at a hotel school, then wound up in Andermatt because of a job offer at a now-defunct hotel. He stayed because of the clean air, the unspoiled mountains, and the people who say “Uela!” to you—the local greeting—on the street every morning.
In April the atmospheric wood-paneled dining room at the 20-room Sonne was still busy, as it had been all season, with a mix of German and British families huddled around piping hot pots of fondue. “In the beginning it was just military,” Gougouth says, reflecting on his first years in Andermatt. “We were just seeing green, green, green, because of the uniforms. But now we see people from around the world. Even celebrities. Singers from the USA, golf players. This year we saw 50% growth over last year,” he says.
Making good on his plan to expand the ski area, Sawiris pumped $140 million into on-mountain infrastructure in only three years. Last season a gleaming eight-person gondola replaced a couple of old chairs; it now whisks skiers to the top of the Gütsch peak, from which they can ski a network of gentle and intermediate slopes before taking another new 10-person gondola into the neighboring resort of Sedrun, in the canton of Graubünden.
The most seasoned of skiers still lap off-piste runs from the Gemsstock’s cable car, but the multigenerational clans who now come to Andermatt make their migration east each morning toward Sedrun, skiing far above the tree line in the high alpine, partaking in that grand, stress-free European ski experience of lazily schussing from village to village.
All told, the interconnected ski area will boast 112 miles of slopes and 33 lifts. That’s two lifts more than Vail, Colo. A further lift connection will open during the 2019-20 winter season, allowing guests to ski all the way to the rolling, family-friendly slopes of Disentis.
Sawiris’s “if you build it, they will come” attitude appears to be working. Last season, Andermatt almost doubled its single-day skier record, attracting 12,000 guests. (Given the size of the expanded resort, that means the slopes were still relatively uncrowded.) But this growth isn’t necessarily what all locals want.
“The core atmosphere of the town is gone, it’s dead, it doesn’t exist anymore,” says Kevin Obschlager, who along with his wife owns the River House, a red-shingled boutique hotel and whiskey bar that opened more than a decade ago and catered to the hardcore skiers who flocked to Andermatt for its soulful atmosphere.
Obschlager likens Andermatt’s genesis—or perhaps downfall—to that of Telluride, which went from funky hippie hideaway to posh enclave, attracting Tom Cruise, Ralph Lauren, Oprah Winfrey, and other celebrities: “Now it’s luxury, luxury, luxury. Before, this place would be packed with smiling faces after powder days. People would come every weekend.” He shrugs. “Now people come once, and then they’re gone—they go to the Caribbean the next weekend.”
During the visit in April at least, Andermatt still felt undiscovered and refreshingly unpretentious. Snow fell at night, a ghostly mist hung among the narrow cobbled lanes cutting through town, and the few remaining military cadets filed into bars or shared cigarettes under the milky glow of streetlights. The slopes were equally uncrowded, and from the summit of the Gemsstock, with 3 feet of fresh snow blanketing the 5,000 feet of vertical leading to the valley, and the rugged mountains of Uri standing like sentinels keeping the rest of the world at bay, one thing was certain: The time to book your trip is most certainly now.

No matter how much advanced technology brands pack into their masks, ski goggles tend to get foggy and limit peripheral vision. Giro’s $250 Contact goggles, with interchangeable lenses, tend not to do either. The Scotts Valley, Calif.-based brand started in cycling helmets but has gained a following for its patented Vivid lenses, developed with camera outfitter Zeiss, and a semiframeless design that offers an expansive panoramic view.
• The $220 Cyrius goggles from Julbo also boast an expanded field of vision, thanks to a frameless construction.
• Oakley’s popular Prizm line of ski masks (from $150) has lenses that tailor tints to specific environments and conditions.
• A pair of $130 Opsin Clarity goggles from POC have three lenses—for sunny, partly sunny, and cloudy conditions—and fit best on medium- or smaller-size faces.
Giro’s lens-swapping system, which the brand calls Snapshot, is an effortless exercise. Press the shutter button down, and the lens pops out quickly; magnets help guide you to click the new one into place. Meanwhile, the Zeiss lenses manipulate blue light to enhance contrast and definition, and air vents around the edge minimize the chance of fogging.  $250; giro.com

Originally published by Jon Bues on Hodinkee.You definitely don't need me to tell you that these days, stainless steel sports watches are, as the kids like to say, a thing. Walking into a watch shop that carries Rolex, Patek Philippe, or Audemars Piguet and actually seeing a steel Nautlius, Aquanaut, Daytona, GMT-Master II, or Royal Oak in a display case was once a commonplace occurrence, but as many of us know all too well, it just isn't anymore. Our own Joe Thompson has written about this state of affairs as it pertains to one of these companies at length. One has to wonder, if supply simply isn't meeting demand for steel watches from the above-mentioned watchmakers, where consumers who have the money and the desire will go? Today, Chopard is launching a new collection of watches called Alpine Eagle, in what looks to be a bid to win over watch buyers looking to scratch the steel sports watch itch.
To understand Alpine Eagle, where it comes from, its place in the broader watch  market, and its position within the Chopard collection, it might be useful to remember the St. Moritz, a sport watch created by Chopard's Karl-Friederich Scheufele back in 1980, when he was a 22-year-old newcomer to the family business. Named for the famed Swiss alpine ski resort and coming in a variety of executions, the St.Moritz was a successful line for a number of years before eventually being phased out in favor of other collections. In the intervening years, the Mille Miglia and its alignment with the world of vintage motorsports came to dominate the sport watch side of Chopard watchmaking, and the more classically elegant side of things was represented by the L.U.C watch collection.
While Chopard  had in the St. Moritz a watch that was tailor-made for looking good while living well – not for driving, flying, or driving – the line was far enough in the rear view mirror that the youngest generation of the Scheufele family, Karl-Fritz Scheufele, had to ask his grandfather Karl about a watch he wore to the office one day a few years ago. It was a stainless steel variation of the St. Moritz that featured the classic configuration of integrated bracelet, tonneau-shaped case, and screwed bezel. ""That's the kind of watch that we should be making today,"" the younger Scheufele said, and he had a point. It is the style of wristwatch that people are lining up to buy in 2019. Today, we're  seeing the launch of a new sport luxury line from Chopard with a design that is informed by the St. Moritz of yesteryear. Still, it bears mentioning that Alpine Eagle is very much indicative of the type of watchmaker Chopard is today, with manufacturing facilities spread throughout Switzerland and an estimable penchant for in-house manufacturing, which is quite a bit different from the kind of watchmaker it was back in 1980. And the increase in watchmaking know-how at Chopard is largely the work of Karl-Friederich Scheufele.
The Alpine Eagle is available in two sizes at its launch. There is a 41mm size and a smaller 36mm variation. Each of the two sizes comes with an in-house movement. In the case of the 41mm size, this is the 01.01-C mechanical movement with automatic winding. It beats at 28,800 vph (4Hz) and has a power reserve of 60 hours. In the case of the 36mm variations, we see the automatic 09.01-C, which beats at a slightly slower 25,200 vph (3.5Hz) and runs for 42 hours on a single wind. With both movements, we have in-house designed and manufactured calibers with COSC chronometer certification. 
At launch, there are ten different references. There are three different variations of the 41mm version with date, and seven examples of the 36mm no-date version. Looking at the collection and seeing the various versions of the 36mm watch with gem-set cases and bracelets, it's tempting to infer that the 36mm size is the ladies's segment of the collection, but that is not how Chopard is presenting them. And in fact, there is a 36mm version in plain stainless steel, sans diamonds, that I had a chance to try on earlier this summer – while I preferred the feel of the 41mm version, I could definitely see guys I know wearing these 36mm versions.
Chopard has long been known for its use of ethically mined gold, and where gold appears in the Alpine Eagle, it is of that type. What's new with the Alpine Eagle is the introduction of a new proprietary alloy of stainless steel called Lucent Steel A223, which is composed partially of recycled stainless steel. Beyond the obvious ecological benefits of repurposing stainless steel in a new product, the new Lucent Steel A223 also boasts practical benefits, among them a greater hardness – to 223 Vickers, making it 50% more resistant to abrasion than conventional steel. All of the case and bracelet components, whether steel or gold, are produced in-house by Chopard. 
The cases feature alternating brushed and polished surfaces with eight screws holding the bezel, case middle, and caseback together. In addition to helping to provide 100 meters of water resistance, the screws, which are grouped in pairs and located at the watch's cardinal positions, provide a modern twist on the original St. Moritz design of 1980. If you look closely, the lines of the screw heads follow the periphery of the dial. I think it would bother me if there wasn't an order to their orientation, and what Chopard has done here feels appropriate for a sport luxury watch. 
The 41mm version of the Alpine Eagle measures 9.7mm from top to bottom and houses a movement that is itself nearly 4.95mm thick. It feels thin and stable on the wrist. Chopard is debuting the 41mm version with three references. These include the two all Lucent Steel A223 versions – one with a blue dial and the other with a grey dial – as well as a third, in two tone Lucent Steel A223 and 18 karat ethical rose gold with a slate grey dial. Prices start at $12,900 for the 41mm steel versions and run up to $19,700 for the two tone. For the 36mm versions, prices start at $10,100 for an all-steel piece that I found wore well on my seven-inch wrist; $14,400 for all-steel with diamond accents; $16,000 for two tone; $20,400 for two-tone with diamonds; $30,000 for all gold; and $34,600 or $45,200 for all gold, with varying amounts of diamonds.
I had a chance to try several versions of the Alpine Eagle, and the bracelets stood out to me for comfort and quality of design. It seems pretty clear when holding them in your hand, and when wearing the Alpine Eagle, that a lot of thought went into their design and construction. They look like the bracelets of the St. Moritz watch that they reference, and they feel great too.
The dials of several of the new pieces in the line feature a a reflective, rock-like texture that is reminiscent of an eagle's iris, and it's from these dials that the Alpine Eagle gets its distinctive name. Why not just call it St. Moritz, one might ask? After all, St. Moritz is a line that people remember and that would pretty instantly ground this new collection in Chopard's own history. The answer is that another watch corporation, the Swatch Group, has an existing agreement in place with the municipality of St. Moritz, and Karl Friedrich Scheufele felt that for this collection, it would be best to go in a different direction and start anew. In any event, while it's easy to see that the design of the Alpine Eagle is an evolution of the St. Moritz, there is a lot of newness here, from the use of a new steel alloy to the implementation of in-house movements. 
To me, it's the use of that new alloy that seems most exciting, especially as it's being deployed in a watch of this design type. There is something about the faceted cases and bracelets often seen on watches of this general type, with their contrasting brushed and polished finishes, that I have long felt makes them more susceptible to showing even slight scratches. Thanks to Lucent Steel A223, one can hope that that the Alpine Eagle will continue to look great after months or years of daily wear. I definitely look forward to reviewing one of the 41mm all-steel variations when I can get my hands on one.

Relatives of the late Raymond Sackler hold a 54% stake in Peak Resorts Inc., which operates 17 ski areas including New York’s Hunter Mountain and Mount Snow in Vermont. Vail Resorts Inc. completed its acquisition of Peak on Tuesday, two months after the deal was announced.
The Sacklers own stock and warrants through Delaware-based Cap 1 LLC, which has held a stake since at least 2015, according to regulatory filings. Beneficiaries of the trust that owns Cap 1 include Raymond’s widow Beverly, son Richard and grandson David. They’re among the eight family members accused in state lawsuits of contributing to the nationwide public-health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans from overdoses.
It’s unclear how much profit the Sacklers reaped from the ski resort deal, because some stock purchases may not have been publicly disclosed. Vail is paying $11 a share for Peak Resorts, a 116% premium over its July 22 closing price. That would value the Sackler stake at $114 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg.
Davidson Goldin, a spokesman for portions of the Sackler family, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Heirs of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler gained notoriety over the past several years as the opioid crisis worsened. Their wealth is founded on drug company Purdue Pharma Inc., maker of the painkiller OxyContin.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy this month to settle claims that it pushed sales of the addictive drug. The Chapter 11 filing is designed to short-circuit more than 2,000 lawsuits against Purdue and the Sackler family by the states, cities and counties that have sued to recoup billion of dollars they spent battling opioid addictions and overdoses. Under a settlement proposal, the governments, hospitals and individuals suing Purdue would take ownership from the Sacklers, who have also agreed to pay at least $3 billion and to sell other assets. Such a deal would be expected to raise a total of more than $10 billion.

Opponents argue Purdue’s plan isn’t enough of a reckoning for the Sacklers, who made billions from the over-prescribing of OxyContin by doctors, spurred by the company’s marketing. The family got more than $4 billion from OxyContin sales from 2008 through 2015, court filings show.
The lawsuits describe a web of trusts, holding entities and investment vehicles comprising the Sackler fortune, including Summer Road LLC, a family office run by David A. Sackler that provides investment-management services to Cap 1.
Summer Road has also invested in hedge fund strategies and bought an office building in West Palm Beach, Florida, for $6.8 million, the Palm Beach Post reported last week. It also owned 8% of eye-care product developer Ocular Therapeutix Inc. and about 7% of Correvio Pharma Corp. as of June 30, according to its latest 13-F filing.

Hawaii, Montana and Maine are the three states whose economies depend most on outdoor recreational activities such as hiking, water sports, hunting and skiing.
The outdoor recreational industry accounted for 5.4% of Hawaii’s gross domestic product in 2017, the largest share of all U.S. states. The Aloha State was followed by Montana and Maine, where recreation contributed 5.1% and 4.8% to their states’ economies, respectively. The industry added $427 billion, or 2.2%, to the nation’s GDP, according to a Commerce Department report Friday.

Vermont, Wyoming, Florida and Alaska also showed a higher relative dependence on outdoor recreation, making up more than 4% of their respective state GDP. Connecticut, Ohio and New York are least dependent on the sector.
Real gross output, labor compensation and employment all grew more in outdoor recreation than the economy as a whole. The industry expanded by an inflation-adjusted 3.9% in 2017, the most recent data available, faster than the broader economy’s 2.4% growth.
Boating and fishing added $20.9 billion to the national economy during the year, led by Florida and California. RVing was the second-largest activity, with $16.9 billion in value added, paced by Indiana and Ohio.

217,SKIS,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-09/tailored-puffer-jackets-coats-by-moncler-saint-laurent-mammut,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-13/the-man-they-call-cactus-bets-bond-salesmen-are-no-longer-needed,"September 13, 2019, 6:00 AM EDT",The Man They Call Cactus Bets Bond Salesmen Are No Longer Needed,"Before Cactus Raazi became a star salesman at Goldman Sachs, before he pioneered electronic bond-pricing -- even before he started calling himself Cactus -- he’d purposely send his burnt-orange 1979 Toyota Corolla skidding through the rain-soaked Santa Monica High School parking lot.
“We came around the bend and what came into sight was our science teacher’s vintage car,” said Jason Bentley, a classmate who rode shotgun. “Thank God we didn’t hit it. We came so close.”
Twenty-five years later, Raazi is still careening, only now it’s called disruption. Through the firm he started in 2016, Elefant Inc., Raazi is trying to reshape how corporate debt trades. Elefant, which bills itself as a digital broker-dealer, uses software rather than traders to determine prices.
“At Elefant, we’ve replaced traders with algorithms and replaced salespeople with APIs,” said Raazi, referring to the code that allows computers to interact with servers. “Software-based pricing is here.”
Elefant has made more than 50,000 such trades -- and raised $15 million in equity capital, with access to an additional $250 million to fund its balance sheet. But the bond market resists change. Trading in stocks, currencies and futures has been screen-based for years, with transaction times measured in milliseconds. Big bond trades, however, are still made over the phone or by instant message.
Raazi isn’t the only one trying to transform this market, and plenty have failed in the past. But now, advances in machine learning are making it easier to sift huge amounts of information so Elefant’s algorithms can determine prices.
The changing environment is part of a broader trend that’s threatening the dominance of Wall Street banks in the corporate-bond market as more investors skip intermediaries and trade among themselves. And it’s bringing long-awaited changes like standardized pricing, automated trading and billion-dollar portfolio deals with it.
Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich Associates, remembered being impressed with Raazi’s idea a few years ago but wondering if the time was right.
Now, however, “the market is ready,” McPartland said. Thirty percent of all bond trades are electronic, an all-time high, according to McPartland’s research. Pricing electronically is what’s new, he said.
“This is Cactus taking it to the next level, where there are immediately executable prices,” McPartland said.
Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, has a bond-trading platform of its own.
Tall and thin with a stubbly, salt-and-pepper beard, Raazi, born with the first name Mehra, wears his hair in a ponytail. He started calling himself Cactus in college, and later made it his legal middle name.
He was four years old when he arrived in Santa Monica from Iran in 1974. His mother found work as a hairstylist in Beverly Hills. His father had been an official in the tourism ministry in Iran. In the U.S., he became an electronics repairman. (“I had a reputation for being very nice to the copy repairman at Goldman,” Raazi said.)
Raazi discovered he had a knack for sales when he got a job hawking skis when he was 15. Bentley, his longtime friend, chalks up Raazi’s ability to needing to fit into a community that was far from welcoming to a Persian transplant.
“Santa Monica High School was a very white, very homogeneous world,” said Bentley, who went on to local fame as host of the KCRW radio show “Morning Becomes Eclectic.” “He used his personality as a strength to make friends.”
While at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Raazi became a young father. He needed to work, so he sold ads for Urb, a hip-hop magazine, and was a doorman at Pink’s nightclub in Santa Monica. Then he developed an interest in finance.
Through a friend, he met Scott Lawin, who worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Raazi moved to New York in 1998 to share an apartment with him. Lawin remembered working each night until 1 or 2 a.m. and returning home to find Raazi waiting up to ask him questions.
“Coming from the trading floor and seeing someone who was a natural salesperson, very bright and hungrier than anyone else -- in my experience, those are the people who succeed on Wall Street,” Lawin said.
Lawin went on to create Parametric LP, a private investment firm that backed Elefant.
After more than 30 interviews, Raazi was hired by Goldman for its medium-term notes desk in 1998. During his first year, Raazi also worked as a doorman at night spot Torch on the Lower East Side. He had child support to pay and traveled to California twice a month to see his son.
“It was a tough existence,” he said.
By 2007, Raazi was selling products called credit-default swaps to hedge funds. A client asked him how to create a short position on the mortgage market, Raazi said.
The ensuing experience landed Raazi a mention at a post-crisis congressional hearing. The subject line for a March 14, 2007, email from Tom Montag, Goldman’s trading boss at the time, to then-Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, read “Cactus Delivers,” and described how Raazi “covered another 1.2 billion in shorts in mortgages.”
“Please recognize Cactus when you get a chance,” another Goldman executive said in the email thread, according to a submission to Senate investigators.
Raazi said that every email he sent during that time has been examined and nothing out of order was found, he said.
“I’m proud of that,” he said.
After failing to be named partner in 2010, Raazi left Goldman. A trip to a Thai elephant sanctuary that year eventually inspired the name of his new firm.
“I was just deeply affected by spending time with them,” he said.
Banks are now approaching Elefant, where coders outnumber traders four to one, to inquire about using its prices, he said. Far from skidding his old Toyota in the rare Southern California rain, Raazi sees a clear path where Wall Street and investors will buy the software-derived prices he’s offering.
“Asset managers want to see this type of transaction,” he said. “They ask for it every time I visit them.”

Mall Get a Peek,"Wall Street has over $1.1 billion riding on the success of New Jersey’s American Dream mega mall, the massive consumer utopia outside New York City that’s been in the works for nearly two decades.
So on Thursday, bondholders will get a sneak peek at the retail and entertainment hub to see what their investments helped create.
Bondholders have been invited to visit the complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, ahead of its much-anticipated opening next month, according to a regulatory filing. Among the firms sending someone is Nuveen, one of the biggest holders of debt issued in 2017 to complete the American Dream.
The project was first proposed in 2003, before the explosion of Internet retailing that’s left many American shopping malls struggling, and was delayed by ownership changes and financial hard times. The developer, Triple Five Group, is wagering it can counter that trend and draw 40 million visitors a year with “fantastical” and “immersive” attractions like a roller coaster, waterslides and an indoor ski slope.
Payments from the owner back much of the project’s unrated debt that was issued through a government agency with access to the municipal-bond market.
Daniel Solender, a partner at Lord, Abbett & Co., which owns the bonds, said he was sending a research analyst to check out everything. “It’s nice to see there’s something that they’re ready to show,” Solender said.
American Dream sold $1.1 billion in unrated bonds in 2017 to help finance the completion of the project, which was once slated to open in 2013. So far, betting on the long-awaited mall has paid off. The price of debt due in 2050 has jumped to almost 120 cents on the dollar, well above its initial price of 102.8 cents on the dollar, because of a broader market rally and demand for high-yield bonds.

It’s unclear whether bondholders will get a chance to hit the slopes on what American Dream says will be the first indoor snow park in the nation, or if they’ll be able to walk across the Nickelodeon Slime Stage. The notice filed on Monday said current and potential bondholders will receive more information after verifying they’re a qualified institutional buyer or sophisticated professional, the kind who can afford to lose money if bonds default.
McManimon, Scotland & Baumann, a law firm listed as the contact on the regulatory filing, did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did American Dream spokeswoman Debbie Patire.

Hurricane Dorian, once again a Category 3 storm, is bearing down upon the Carolinas after sweeping past Florida and Georgia and battering the Bahamas, where it killed at least 20 people.
Dorian brought life-threatening storm surges as it reached about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 5 a.m. New York time. The storm’s maximum sustained winds were at 115 miles per hour. Crawling on its current path at about 8 miles per hour, it’s expected to move toward the northeast.
“The center of Dorian will continue to move close to the coast of South Carolina through the day, and then move near or over the coast of North Carolina tonight and Friday,” the hurricane center said in its advisory.

Meanwhile, the Bahamas is starting to assess the damage from the strongest storm to hit the island nation in modern history, with Prime Minister Hubert Minnis confirming in a press conference that at least 20 people have died on Abaco Island, a number that’s expected to increase, according to the Bahamas Press.
The storm is expected to pick up speed on Friday, and its center should move toward the extreme southeast of New England beginning tomorrow night, approaching Nova Scotia on Saturday, according to the NHC. It issued a tropical storm watch for parts of Massachusetts, including Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.

Hurricane warnings are still in effect for the Savannah River to the North Carolina-Virginia border, as well as for the Pamlico and Albemarle sounds just inside North Carolina’s Outer Banks.
President Donald Trump earlier this week declared a state of emergency in North Carolina, clearing the way for U.S. disaster relief. Coastal areas of the Carolinas are likely to receive stronger winds than Florida, Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist at the Weather Co., an IBM business, said in an email.
Trump altered a Hurricane Dorian map to show it threatened Alabama.
Parts of South Carolina were expected to see storm surges of as much as 8 feet. High water and flooding is also expected along the Outer Banks and up to Hampton Roads in Virginia, according to the NHC. The coastal Carolinas were set to receive 6 to 12 inches of rain, with as much as 15 inches in some areas.
In Charleston, where sandbags have been distributed, the city council approved an emergency order to enact a curfew, should one be necessary, according to a tweet. Local and state governments have ordered coastline residents and businesses to begin evacuations.
Duke Energy Corp, which owns several utilities in the region, moved an extra 4,000 repair workers from other states and Canada to the Carolinas in anticipation of the hurricane’s arrival, according to a statement. The company estimates as many as 700,000 power outages could happen because of the storm. Santee Cooper, which supplies power to 2 million people in South Carolina, has a crew of more than 800 standing by for recovery efforts.

The hurricane couldn’t arrive at a worse time for farmers in the region raising cotton, tobacco, hemp and corn. Fields were maturing and high winds could deal a potentially devastating blow before farmers have a chance to harvest.
In the Bahamas, meanwhile, waters were receding on Thursday from a storm surge that reached 23 feet at times during the two days Dorian sat over the archipelago. Prime Minister Minnis said he expects the death toll to rise, noting in a news conference that parts of Abaco -- the area first hit by the storm -- have been “decimated” with “severe damage to homes, businesses and other buildings and infrastructure.”

Minnis said in a tweet that he spoke with Trump and Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who both pledged assistance to Grand Bahama and Abaco. Large tracts of homes are under water, outbreaks of looting are adding to the country’s misery.
Equinor ASA said Thursday that its oil-storage facility in the Bahamas sustained damage from the storm. Some oil had been observed on the ground by the tanks, though none had been observed at sea, the company said in a statement.
The damage wrought upon the islands is likely to run into “hundreds of millions if not billions,” the Nassau Guardian newspaper earlier in the week cited Deputy Prime Minister Peter Turnquest as saying.

Freeport, Bahamas (AP) -- The Latest on Hurricane Dorian (all times local):
9:40 p.m.
Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis says he has visited storm-ravaged Grand Bahama, finding many people remain in shelters even though much of the flooding has eased.
Minnis spoke at a news briefing Wednesday evening and said many are suffering in Grand Bahama after it was devastated by Hurricane Dorian. He added: ""We know there are many Bahamians that are in need of help. I want to assure you that more help is on the way.""
He thanked the international community for its response, especially the U.S. government for what he called their ""exceptional assistance.""
Earlier this week, Dorian smashed through the northern Bahamas as the strongest hurricane ever to hit the islands, leaving at least 20 dead.
Minnis noted that several agencies and organizations have pledged aid, including $1 million each from the United Nations and from Disney Cruise Line. Meanwhile, National Security Minister Marvin Dames said food and water is being distributed to people in the neighboring Abaco islands but that more supplies will be needed soon.

American Red Cross officials say that more than 1,500 people have sought refuge from Hurricane Dorian in a total of 28 shelters in the central and eastern portions of South Carolina.
In Charleston, South Carolina, meanwhile, steady rain began falling Wednesday evening as Dorian approached the Carolinas and winds began picking up. Thunder could be heard frequently and only a few cars seemed to be plying the roads connecting the western edge of downtown Charleston with areas of the city just across a river.
Forecasters say the Category 2 hurricane was centered at 8 p.m. EDT Wednesday about 130 miles (210 kilometers) south of Charleston. It has top sustained winds of 110 mph (175 kph) and is moving to the north-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph). Earlier this week, Dorian smashed through the northern Bahamas as the strongest hurricane ever to hit the islands, leaving at least 20 dead.

People in the hard-hit Abaco islands say they haven't seen any aid come in after Dorian's onslaught, except for medical supplies for the main hospital, where hundreds are gathered to await help.
Ben Allen, a 40-year-old construction worker and maintenance man, worried about supplies of potable water running out.
""Today is the last day you're going to find water,"" said Ben Allen, a 40-year-old construction worker and maintenance man.
Earlier Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock disclosed that about 70,000 people ""are in immediate need of life-saving assistance"" on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands following Hurricane Dorian's pummeling of the Bahamas.
Dorian smashed into the northern Bahamas earlier this week as a powerful Category 5 and Category 4 hurricane, leaving at least 20 dead.

Nathan May evacuated his Carolina Beach, North Carolina, home for Hurricane Florence last year. After it didn't flood and only a few branches were knocked down, he decided he would ride out Hurricane Dorian as it trekked up the coast.
""I want to see what it is like,"" said May, who moved from Arizona a few years ago. ""A bunch of the neighbors are having a party and they said we will be OK. This one isn't too strong.""
May is an electrician and has a generator ready to run his air conditioner and a few other items. He was going to wire up more things, but Dorian's outer bands reached the North Carolina coast too quickly Wednesday afternoon.
Fran Mitteness and her husband Mo are also staying put in Carolina Beach. They left for Florence when it was a Category 4 and immediately regretted it when the storm weakened. Their regret only grew when it took weeks to get back.
Says Fran Mittenness: ""This is just a Category 2. We are ready. I think we will be fine.

Bahamian Health Minister Duane Sands tells The Associated Press that the death toll from Hurricane Dorian has risen to 20 and that more fatalities are expected.
Sands said Wednesday night that 17 victims are from the Abaco islands and three from Grand Bahama. He says three of the 20 victims died after being transported to a hospital in nearby New Providence.
Sands says he's unable to release further details at this time because the government still is working to contact family members.
The sharp jump in the death toll comes after search and rescue teams fanned out across both islands as floodwaters receded and the weather cleared. Dorian hit the Abaco islands as a catastrophic Category 5 storm on Sunday and then lashed Grand Bahama for a day and a half as a Category 4 storm, leaving widespread devastation.
____
7:05 p.m.
U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock says about 70,000 people ""are in immediate need of life-saving assistance"" on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands following Hurricane Dorian's pummeling of the Bahamas.
Lowcock says the most urgent needs are water, food, shelter and accommodation.
He flew to the Bahamas on Wednesday and spoke to reporters in New York by phone from Nassau after meeting with Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.
Lowcock says he told Minnis that he was releasing $1 million from the U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund immediately to deal with these priorities as well as for medical supplies and services for Grand Bahama. He says the United Nations began gathering data Wednesday with officials in the region ""so we really understand where the most vulnerable people are and what their precise needs are.""

White House spokesman Judd Deere says President Donald Trump has offered his condolences to Prime Minister Hubert Minnis of the Bahamas for the loss of life and catastrophic destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian.
Deere says the president underscored the importance of the friendship between the United States and the Bahamas.
The president also said the United States will provide all appropriate support to the people of the Bahamas during the Bahamian government's response to Hurricane Dorian. Both leaders agreed to continue close coordination to ensure the most efficient and effective use of humanitarian aid and disaster response efforts.
Earlier this week Dorian mauled the northern Bahamas as a Category 5 hurricane, causing widespread devastation and leaving at least seven people dead. Officials say the death toll is certain to rise.

The approach of Dorian has left the cobblestone streets of Savannah, Georgia's downtown historic district largely deserted. But there are still places to find a hurricane party.
More than 30 people gathered around the bar at Pinkie Master's Lounge on Wednesday evening, as wind gusts from the storm offshore of the Georgia coast bent the tops of trees in Savannah nearly 20 miles (32 kilometers) inland.
Co-owner Mike Warren was tending bar. He says crowds had been steady for hours. A mandatory evacuation order meant most businesses were closed and many locals had a day off work. Warren says the bar would abide by Savannah's 9 p.m. curfew — moving up last call about 6 hours early.

There were boarded up windows and empty parking lots in Wilmington, North Carolina, about 24 hours before Hurricane Dorian was forecast to sideswipe the area.
But there were plenty of open gas stations without lines and traffic heading both in and out of town.
Wilmington is used to storms. Hurricane Florence hit the area last year. Old timers struggle to keep the storms separate in their minds. At least 10 hurricanes have passed through the area in the past 25 years including the back-to-back blows of Bertha and Fran in 1996.
About 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of Wilmington, plenty of people were staying at Carolina Beach despite a mandatory evacuation for the barrier island. The few open restaurants had full parking lots.
Fran Mitteness is staying with her husband. They evacuated for Florence last year and their home three blocks from the ocean wasn't damaged. They were frustrated when they couldn't get back for weeks.

The U.S. Navy has ordered ships based on Virginia's coast to head out to sea to avoid Hurricane Dorian.
Navy spokeswoman Elizabeth Baker said by phone Wednesday that vessels docked at the world's largest Navy base in Norfolk and other nearby installations are getting under way. Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis said in a statement that the ships will remain at sea until the threat from the storm subsides. Navy aircraft will either be secured in hangars or fly to more inland airfields.
The Navy's order follows a similar one made by the U.S Air Force earlier Tuesday. F-22 Raptor fighter jets and T-38 Talon training planes were ordered to leave Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia. They're going to a base outside Columbus, Ohio.

""We want everyone to leave who can,"" McMaster said during a briefing Wednesday. ""We know there are some who can't or some who don't want to for various reasons. But we're urging people to be safe, rather than sorry.
Transportation Secretary Christy Hall says an estimated 360,000 people had evacuated the Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Beaufort-Hilton Head Island areas as of 8 a.m. Wednesday.
Authorities say any who have chosen to remain in the evacuation zone should let relatives know where they are.

The congressman who represents much of South Carolina's coast says he's doing what he can to make sure his district is prepared as Hurricane Dorian approaches.
U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he's spent days making sure his constituents have the information they need to stay safe. That includes manning informational phone lines and helping an area food bank. Cunningham spoke after touring the U.S. Coast Guard's operations center in North Charleston, South Carolina.
This is the Democrat's first hurricane season since taking office earlier this year. He plans to ride out the storm with his family in West Ashley, near downtown Charleston.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Dorian remained a Category 2 hurricane and was centered Wednesday afternoon about 150 miles south of Charleston and approaching the Carolinas. Earlier this week Dorian mauled the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm, causing widespread devastation on some of its northern islands and leaving at least seven people dead.

Hurricane Dorian has strengthened a little as it tracks up the Southeast seaboard off Georgia.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Dorian's top sustained winds are back up to 110 mph (175 kph). Dorian is a Category 2 hurricane with its eye located about 150 miles (245 kilometers) south of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm is moving to the north-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).
Forecasters say a tropical storm warning has been issued from North Carolina and the Virginia border to Chincoteague, Virginia, and for Chesapeake Bay from Smith Point southward.
Dorian slammed into the northern Bahamas earlier this week as a Category 5 storm, the strongest hurricane on record ever to hit the islands. At least seven deaths in the Bahamas have been reported by authorities, but they leave little doubt the toll will rise further amid scenes of wide devastation on some of the islands.

Authorities say a Florida man in a suburb of Orlando has died after falling from a tree while preparing for Hurricane Dorian.
Police in the suburb of Ocoee said in a statement that 56 -year-old Joseph Walden died Monday evening while Dorian was roaring across the Bahamas with a projected path that might have included central Florida.
Police say Walden was sitting on a tree limb and using a chain saw to trim other limbs. One of the cut limbs broke free and struck the man, which caused him to fall to the ground. Walden was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

A group of Bahamians on hurricane-ravaged Great Abaco island are awaiting help, even as cars go past and helicopters fly overhead.
Among those hoping for relief assistance is 89-year-old Sylvia Cottis, who uses a wheelchair and has an infected gash on her right knee and a leg cut by bits of glass when a window shattered during Dorian's rampage. Her caregiver, Kathryn Cartwright, 58, says of her elderly charge: ""I can't leave her here too long."" So far, the only help they had received was from neighbors helping clear debris.
Others are in better condition. Kevie Thomas, who lives in the house beside Cottis, says she and some friends are drinking rainwater and eating small amounts of food to make supplies last. She says the hurricane was horrendous, but adds, ""If you're alive, to me that's important. How can you be upset?""
At least seven deaths have been reported in the Bahamas from Dorian, with the full scope of the disaster still unknown.

The U.S. Coast Guard is preparing boats and helicopters for any rescue operations that may be needed after Hurricane Dorian makes its way along the South Carolina coast.
Capt. John Reed said Wednesday that boats had been brought in from other Coast Guard stations along the Southeastern coast. They've been placed at the Charleston Area Convention Center in North Charleston.
A helicopter is stationed at Savannah, Georgia, about 100 miles (161 km) away.
Aside from being ready for water rescues, Reed says the Coast Guard is focused on keeping areas around the Port of Charleston safe so the port can reopen as quickly as possible after the storm.
In 2017, $69 billion worth of cargo moved through the port, which is a major employer and economic driver in South Carolina.

Officials in South Carolina county are warning about the potential for life-threatening flooding from Hurricane Dorian.
A statement from Georgetown County says anyone who lives near the waterfront in the coastal town of Georgetown should evacuate.
The city of about 8,900 people is located on the coast north of Charleston. It's situated along a bay and two rivers, the Great Pee Dee and the Sampit.
The county's statement says the National Weather Service contacted officials there to warn about the combination of storm surge and high tide at Georgetown on Thursday afternoon.
Rising seas caused by the storm could add as much as 6 feet to normal high tide levels. The county says anyone who doesn't leave may be putting themselves at risk.

Utilities say Hurricane Dorian could leave hundreds of thousands without electricity in the southeastern United States as it moves up the Atlantic Coast.
Duke Energy says the slow-moving storm could cause more than 700,000 power outages in eastern regions of North Carolina and South Carolina based on current predictions.
The utility says some outages could last for several days, and problems are expected as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) inland.
Georgia Power says about 2,800 homes and businesses are without power in coastal areas of Georgia and several thousand utility customers are in the dark in northeast Florida.
It isn't just electricity that's being affected. Brunswick County in coastal North Carolina is shutting off water and sewer service in advance of Dorian.

Rain from the outermost bands of Hurricane Dorian have been pelting downtown Charleston, South Carolina, where shops normally bustling with tourists are boarded up along King Street. The historic city sits on a peninsula that already floods at high tides, and the city is expecting trouble as Dorian's storm surge tops a 10 foot high tide on Thursday.
Hundreds of people in low-lying areas are evacuating to shelters ahead of the storm, supported by Red Cross volunteers.
U.S. Army veteran Mark Russell says he went to a shelter early to avoid the rush. He doesn't want to experience what he lived through during Hurricane Hugo, which slammed into South Carolina's coast in 1989, killing dozens of people and causing $6 billion in damage.

Sea turtle nests along many of Florida's beaches are in danger of being washed out to sea as Hurricane Dorian sideswipes the Atlantic Coast.
Conservation officials urge the public not to interfere by trying to rescue any stranded hatchlings or disturbing buried nests.
Volusia County's seat turtle habitat conservation plan manager Jennifer Winters tell the Orlando Sentinel ""there's not a lot"" that can be done. She says once eggs get pulled from the sand, ""they're not going to make it.""
She says on Friday 397 sea turtle nests were recorded on Volusia County beaches. Since Saturday, 40 nests were washed out and more are expected as Dorian passes by.

It has top sustained winds of 105 mph (168 kph) as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm is moving north northwest at 8 mph (12 kph), tracking offshore and nearly parallel to Florida's Atlantic shoreline.
Some weakening is expected during the next couple of days but Dorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane.
The Miami-based weather center says a turn toward the north is forecast by Wednesday evening, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast on Thursday morning. The core of Dorian will move dangerously close to the Florida east coast and the Georgia coast through Wednesday night. The center of Dorian is forecast to move near or over the coast of South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday through Friday morning.

Freeport, Bahamas (AP) -- The ground crunched under Greg Alem's feet on Wednesday as he walked over the ruins of his home, laid waste by Hurricane Dorian. He touched a splintered beam of wood and pointed to the fallen trees, overcome by memories.
""We planted those trees ourselves. Everything has a memory, you know,"" he said. ""It's so, so sad. ... In the Bible there is a person called Job, and I feel like Job right now. He's lost everything, but his faith kept him strong.""
The devastation wrought by Dorian — and the terror it inflicted during its day-and-a-half mauling of the Bahamas — came into focus Wednesday as the passing of the storm revealed a muddy, debris-strewn landscape of smashed and flooded-out homes on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands. The official death toll from the strongest hurricane on record ever to hit the country jumped to 20, and there was little doubt it would climb higher.
With a now-distant Dorian pushing its way up the Southeastern U.S. coast, menacing Georgia and the Carolinas, many people living in the Bahamas were in shock as they slowly came out of shelters and checked on their homes.
In one community, George Bolter stood in the bright sunshine and surveyed the ruins of what was once his home. He picked at the debris, trying to find something, anything, salvageable. A couple of walls were the only thing left.
""I have lost everything,"" he said. ""I have lost all my baby's clothes, my son's clothes. We have nowhere to stay, nowhere to live. Everything is gone.""
The Bahamian government sent hundreds of police officers and marines into the stricken islands, along with doctors, nurses and other health care workers, in an effort to reach drenched and stunned victims and take the full measure of the disaster.
""There are many in Grand Bahama who are suffering,"" Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news conference. ""We know there are many Bahamians that are in need of help. I want to assure you that more help is on the way.""
He thanked the international community for its response, especially the U.S. government for what he called their ""exceptional assistance.""
The U.S. Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and relief organizations including the United Nations and the Red Cross joined the burgeoning effort to rush food and medicine to survivors and lift the most desperate people to safety by helicopter. The U.S. government also dispatched urban search-and-rescue teams.
Londa Sawyer stepped off a helicopter in Nassau, the capital, with her two children and two dogs after being rescued from Marsh Harbor in the Abaco islands.
""I'm just thankful I'm alive,"" she said. ""The Lord saved me.""
Sawyer said that her home was completely flooded and that she and her family fled to a friend's home, where the water came up to the second floor and carried them up to within a few feet of the roof. She said she and her children and the dogs were floating on a mattress for about half an hour until the water began receding.
Sandra Cooke, who lives in Nassau, said her sister-in-law was trapped under her roof for 17 hours in the Abaco islands and wrapped herself in a shower curtain as she waited.
""The dog laid on top of her to keep her warm until the neighbors could come to help,"" she said. ""All of my family lives in Marsh Harbor, and everybody lost everything. Not one of them have a home to live anymore.""
The storm pounded the Bahamas with Category 5 winds up to 185 mph (295 kph) and torrential rains, swamping neighborhoods in brown floodwaters and destroying or severely damaging, by one estimate, nearly half the homes in Abaco and Grand Bahama, which have 70,000 residents and are known for their marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts.
Bahamian Health Minister Duane Sands said 17 of the dead were from the Abaco islands and three from Grand Bahama. He said he could not release further details because the government still had to contact family members.
Some people in the Abaco islands complained that they had not seen any aid except for medical supplies for the main hospital, where hundreds of people were temporarily living as they awaited help.
By late Wednesday, Dorian has crept back up to Category 3 force with 115 mph (185 kph) winds and was pushing toward a brush with the Carolinas — with a direct hit on the outer banks possible. An estimated 3 million people in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina had been warned to clear out, and highways leading inland were turned into one-way evacuation routes.
At 11 p.m. EDT, Dorian was centered about 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of Charleston, South Carolina, moving north at 7 mph (11 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 60 miles (100 kilometers) from its center.
Forecasters said there was the danger of life-threatening floods as storm surge moves inland from the coastline, as well as the potential for over a foot of rain in some spots.
""Hurricane Dorian has its sights set on North Carolina,"" Gov. Roy Cooper said. ""We will be ready.""
As the threat to Florida eased and the danger shifted farther up the coast, Orlando's airport reopened, along with Walt Disney World and Universal. To the north, ships at the big Norfolk, Virginia, naval base were ordered to head out to sea for safety, and warplanes at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia were sent inland.
The U.S. mainland recorded its first death in connection with the hurricane, that of an 85-year-old man in North Carolina who fell off a ladder while preparing his home for the storm. Dorian was also blamed for one death in Puerto Rico.
On Tybee Island, Georgia, Debbie and Tony Pagan stacked their beds and couches atop other furniture and covered their doors with plastic wrap and sandbags before evacuating. Their home flooded during both Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Irma in
2017.
""It's a terrible way to live,"" Debbie Pagan said. ""We have the whole month of September and October to go. How would you like to be living on pins and needles?""
Another Tybee islander, Sandy Cason, said: ""The uncertainty and the unknown are the worst part. Just not knowing what's going to be here when you get back.""
Along King Street in historic Charleston, South Carolina, dozens of shops and restaurants typically bustling with tourists were boarded up, plywood and corrugated metal over windows and doors, as the flood-prone downtown area braced for high water.
Mark Russell, an Army veteran who has lived in South Carolina much of his life, went to a hurricane shelter right away. As for those who hesitated to do so, he said: ""If they go through it one time, maybe they'll understand.""

Want the lowdown on what's moving European markets in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.
Good morning. Boris Johnson lost his first key vote as U.K. prime minister, a crucial U.S. data point missed expectations, the trade scenario is still not much clearer and another European rate setter is sounding a little hawkish. Here’s what’s moving markets.
Six weeks into the top job and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is staring into the abyss. Members of the House of Commons voted 328 to 301 Tuesday to  take control of the parliamentary agenda, and now plan to put forward a draft law that would force Johnson to delay Brexit until Jan. 31. If that vote passes, the PM says he’ll call a general election. Here’s a roundup of the equity sectors and  stocks to watch if he follows through on his pledge.
If you were glued to events in Westminster yesterday, you might have missed it. But from a global markets perspective,  something possibly even bigger was happening, as a key U.S. factory gauge unexpectedly contracted for the first time since 2016. The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers index was  weaker than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, falling below 50 to indicate the manufacturing economy is shrinking. The dollar tumbled, and it failed to recover overnight. 
Investors aren’t yet getting the trade clarity they seek. U.S. President Donald Trump warned China on Tuesday that any trade deal will be much tougher on the Asian nation if it happens after he wins the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, China’s largest technology company, Huawei Technologies Co., was in focus again, accusing Washington of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyber-attacks to infiltrate its internal network. The recent tariff fallout has led some economists to cut their forecasts for Chinese economic growth in 2020 to below 6%.
Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday on low volumes amid focus on the ISM number. The euro was steady as European Central Bank policy maker Francois Villeroy de Galhau  added to skepticism over the need for renewed asset purchases and in Italy, Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte is set to  form the next government after getting the backing of supporters of the Five Star Movement.  Oil futures in New York edged higher after closing 2.1% lower on Tuesday.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s appearance before the Treasury Committee today could be one of his last chances to publicly address lawmakers before the Halloween Brexit deadline. On the data front, we await the services purchasing managers’ index from the euro area and the U.K. French aerospace and defense firm Dassault Aviation SA and U.K. home-builder Barratt Developments Plc are among companies scheduled to report earnings.

An island in the Bahamas that’s home to 50,000 people is 70% under water after Hurricane Dorian battered it with record force for two days, according to the government.
There are “still many outstanding rescue missions,” on the island of Grand Bahama, Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Kevin Peter Turnquest said, in reply to written questions. “It’s not looking good as we expect catastrophic damage.”

Seaports and airports in Grand Bahama and the nearby Abaco Islands are flooded or damaged, complicating the task of rescuing people cut off by flood waters.
The National Emergency Management Agency sent out an “urgent plea” for owners of equipment such as flatbeds, jet skis, small boats, trucks and buses to assemble at a shopping mall on Grand Bahama to help with the rescue operation.
The U.S. Coast Guard and British Royal Navy sent ships to assist.
Boats are damaged at a marina in the Bahamas on Sept. 2.
The storm is now traveling northwest away from the archipelago at nearly 5 miles per hour, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said at 2 p.m. New York time.
It could potentially hit the East Coast of the U.S.
At least five people died in the storm, but National Security Minister Marvin Dames said this figure is likely to rise, and will include some children, according to a report in the Nassau Guardian, a local newspaper.
Humanitarian aid organizations estimate 13,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed in the Bahamas, according to a report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands between them have about 2,250 of the 17,500 hotel rooms in the Bahamas, Resort Capital Partners, a real estate investment advisory firm that covers the region, said in reply to emailed questions.
The severity of the storm impact on Grand Bahama and Abaco over the last two days may be the greatest ever experienced by any populated area in the Atlantic basin, according to Ryan Truchelut, president of Weather Tiger in Tallahassee, Florida.

After 16 years of false starts, the behemoth American Dream retail and amusement complex is set to open just west of Manhattan. To get there, an expected 40 million visitors must join the traffic-choked roads of northern New Jersey.
The project’s owner, Triple Five Group, expects crowds to rival those at its Mall of America, where express buses, free shuttles and Minnesota’s most-traveled light-rail route carry people to the busiest U.S. shopping destination. Unlike Minnesota, New Jersey has no plans to link the site by rail from its major airport. In fact, it has no plans for any new train service, only additional bus routes with extended hours and stops.

American Dream was built in New Jersey’s Meadowlands, where some of the nation’s most congested highways crisscross swamps, former landfills and commuter towns. In and around neighboring MetLife Stadium, home to the busiest National Football League playing schedule and a favorite concert stop for the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Beyonce, stand-still traffic and transit muck-ups are routine.
“At peak hours, I can see traffic being backed all the way up to the Lincoln Tunnel,” Secaucus Mayor Mike Gonnelli, whose town hall is 6 miles from Times Square, predicted for American Dream. “I don’t know how extra buses are going to be enough for 40 million people.”

The complex’s 3 million square feet (279,000 square meters) are 45% retail and 55% entertainment, including what Triple Five calls the Western Hemisphere’s biggest indoor theme park, North America’s only indoor snow skiing and a DreamWorks water park. Among the tenants are Saks Fifth Avenue, Hermes, Century 21, a kosher food market and a 20-restaurant dining terrace.
While the opening coincides with a dire retail outlook -- fewer than half of U.S. malls are expected to survive ongoing store closings, according to Bloomberg Intelligence -- American Dream says it can beat the odds because of its attractions mix and accessibility to New York City, on pace to draw 67 million tourists this year.

Proposed in 2003 as a mega-mall called Xanadu, the project’s ownership changes and financial hard times left it unfinished. Its indoor ski slope became a forlorn landmark for New Jersey Turnpike motorists; its garish multicolored exterior in 2011 was called “the ugliest damn building in New Jersey, and possibly America” by then-Governor Chris Christie.
Edmonton, Canada-based Triple Five Group took ownership in 2011, ultimately securing $1.7 billion in construction loans from JPMorgan Chase & Co., $1.1 billion in tax-exempt municipal bonds, $500 million from the developer and tenant payments. The state Economic Development Authority in 2015 approved $390 million in tax breaks.
As the Oct. 25 opening approaches, traffic skepticism has taken root even among some who had cheered the state incentives.
“The problem is going to be it’s so congested that you can’t get there,” said Senate President Steve Sweeney, a South Jersey Democrat.
Plans call for three helipads at the mall. For those taking more common transportation, American Dream says not to worry.
“We are working closely with New Jersey Transit and NY Waterway to provide guests with convenient, easy ways to reach American Dream from New York and the surrounding area,” Dana McHugh, an American Dream spokeswoman, said in an email. A ride-share hub and 30,000 parking spaces will be on site, she said.
New Jersey Transit, the nation’s largest statewide mass-transportation provider, is adding daily express service every 30 minutes from the Midtown Manhattan Port Authority Bus Terminal, where homeless people, panhandlers and harried commuters jostle amid stench-permeated hallways. A replacement for the depot, operating beyond capacity for more than 50 years, won’t open until at least 2030.
Janna Chernetz, New Jersey policy director for the non-profit Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said buses may not be the best fit for visitors weighed down by purchases and post-water park clothes.
“What is the draw for people to use mass transit for American Dream?” Chernetz said. “I’m still trying to get public transportation to work for the people who live in that area.”
Other American Dream buses will run locally, and between East Rutherford and the Secaucus train station, one stop from Manhattan. Special-events crowds there, though, have a tendency to overwhelm platforms. In an email, Jim Smith, an NJ Transit spokesman, said the agency will “ensure that demand is properly met with commensurate service.”
NJ Transit has no plan to build any sort of link from Newark Liberty International Airport, about 10 miles from American Dream. Trains won’t service American Dream until the system “is resilient enough that doing so won’t adversely affect New Jersey commuters,” Nancy Snyder, an agency spokeswoman, said by email.
NJ Transit also is studying an elevated train, like the $4.9 billion system under construction at the Los Angeles airport, “to provide seamless public transit” between Secaucus and the Meadowlands, Stephen Schapiro, a state transportation department spokesman, said in an email. “Specific cost and route are to be determined.”
New Jersey’s railroad doesn’t have an estimated $1 billion to build a crucial loop so trains between Secaucus and the complex could run in both directions simultaneously. This year, WrestleMania fans threatened to riot when rail ran hours behind, and Rolling Stones concertgoers were warned about two-hour train waits.
Even the “first mass-transit Super Bowl,” in 2014, flopped when buses and trains were ill-prepared to handle football’s most-hyped game. With the mall set to open in the thick of the season, the Giants have worked with American Dream and the state “to best address traffic and parking in the sports complex,” according to team spokesman Pat Hanlon.
“Our first concern is our fans and their ability to enter and leave the sports complex on game days,” Hanlon said in an email.
Another football league, the XFL, says its New York Guardians will play eight games at MetLife’s 82,500-seat stadium when matches start in 2020.

Northeastern New Jersey is one of the most densely populated regions in the nation. The state has the nation’s worst urban traffic and road conditions, according to an August report by the Reason Foundation, a research group that advocates free markets.
In the Meadowlands region, upgrades to the Turnpike, Routes 3 and 120 and local roads have done little to alleviate congestion, said Jeff Tittel, New Jersey chapter director of the Sierra Club, the Oakland, California-based environmental group.
“This is an area with some of the worst air quality anywhere in the country especially because of trucks, buses and automobiles,” Tittel said. Even without Meadowlands events underway, some streets see in excess of 100,000 automobiles a day, state data show.
Tittel, using Californians’ term of doom for tie-ups during freeway construction shutdowns, said the roads can’t handle more.
“It’s going to be Carmageddon,” he said.

Dennis Wilson has seen his stake in China’s biggest sportswear maker gain 32% after strong earnings boosted Anta’s shares last week, extending a rally that’s now at 72% for the year. Anta reported 28% growth in net income for the first half of 2019, beating analysts’ estimates.
Anta’s continued rally comes in defiance of attacks by short sellers Blue Orca Capital LLC and Muddy Waters Capital LLC, which issued critical reports less than six weeks apart earlier this year questioning the company’s accounting and corporate governance. Investors shrugged off the allegations -- which the company said were untrue and showed a lack of knowledge about business operations -- and sent its stock to an historic high.
Anta Jumps After Fighting Back on ‘Misleading’ Short Sell Attack
The Jinjiang, Fujian-based company has ambitions to become a global sportswear giant to rival Nike Inc. and Adidas AG. Last December, it agreed to pay $5.2 billion for Finland’s Amer Sports Oyj, which makes Atomic ski equipment and Saloman ski boots. Wilson’s subsequent investment in Anta was due to the fact that he had also been pursuing Amer, Anta said.
Wilson’s 0.59% stake in Anta is now valued at HK$1.03 billion, up a third from the HK$778 million he paid at the end of May.

And those were the good trails.
A decade-long mega drought intensified this year in the Andes mountains above Santiago, limiting snowfall to just a few days and dealing a blow to an industry that attracted 1.4 million visitors last year.
This was near peak season and the restaurants at El Colorado, one of five resorts in central Chile, were largely empty. Of the few people there, many had booked their tickets early in the season and stood to lose their money if they didn’t go now. Snow cannons parked along the sides of the few slopes still open were evidence of El Colorado’s efforts to keep the season alive, while Andean condors added a morbid touch by circling over the near-empty trails.
“It has been truly depressing,” said Natalia Contreras, a ski instructor who recently gave up on the Valle Nevado resort and headed to the south of the country. “It snowed only twice, just a little bit, and it melted quickly because of the high temperatures.”
The lack of snow was a disappointment to the tens of thousands of Brazilians who fly south every year for skiing, not to mention the wealthy Chileans for whom skiing is an integral part of their winter.
Chile’s worst season in years is part of a bigger problem. Ski resorts from the Alps in Europe to Sierra Nevada in California have been hit by similar weather conditions in recent years as global temperatures rise and traditional rain and snowfall patterns change. The industry is adapting with imaginative solutions, from so-called snow farming in France to building new resorts at higher altitude in the U.S. and Canada.
Resorts in Chile invested a combined $24 million this year in new infrastructure, including snow cannons. That might not be enough. The Atacama desert, the world’s driest, is expanding south as rainfall declines, drying up the rivers and parching the rich fruit growing fields around Santiago.

The authorities have already declared a drought emergency in four regions in central Chile, home to over two thirds of the country’s population.
Rainfall in the capital Santiago is about a quarter of the average of the last century, according to the meteorological office. In fact, the city hasn’t had the average amount of rain for more than a decade. No rain is forecast in central Chile for the next few days and only a quarter of lifts and 13% of ski slopes were open at El Colorado resort on Friday. 
The ski resorts in the Andes mountains less than a two-hour drive from the city have registered about 180 centimeters (71 inches) of snowfall, according to the industry group Aceski. Much of that quickly melted, leaving just one or two centimeters of snow in most slopes, the resorts’ websites show.
This season is expected to be 90 to 95 days long, compared to 101 last year, and will attract about 900,000 skiers, according to Aceski general manager Francisco Sotomayor. Many of them will be disappointed.
“It’s frustrating because the skiable area has been reduced to a bare minimum,” said Paul Oliger, a 53-year-old skier who has owned a house at one of the resorts for almost three decades. “Even us, ski fanatics, are not motivated to go up there under these conditions.”

The days when winter storms left cars and roads buried under the snow are long gone, says Contreras, the ski instructor. She has a decade of experience working in the area and, with no snow forecast for the next few days, she is packing her bags and moving to the southern town of Pucon, where she will train for a higher ski instructor degree.
“In this line of work, if you don’t have the weather you don’t have a job,” she said. “The south is more unstable, has fewer people and worse infrastructure, but it’s packed with snow.”

Former hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry has a new gig as a property developer in the celebrity island playground of St. Barts.
Hendry, 50, shut down his macro trading firm in 2017 after a 15-year run ended in mounting losses. Now he’s looking to cash in on demand for homes on the Caribbean island best known as a holiday destination for the rich and famous. He aims to raise $50 million to acquire land for development and to renovate existing properties.

In addition to building high-end luxury villas, Hendry also plans to build affordable homes to help address what he called a “housing crisis for the working community” on the island. The fund, based in Luxembourg, could deliver annualized returns of at least 10% for investors, he said.
“This place is one of a kind,” he said, likening the island to Galt’s Gulch in Ayn Rand’s novel “Atlas Shrugged.” “It’s where all the rich folks are going to end up at the end of this mammoth return-on-capital cycle.”
Most tourists stay in villas that can range from $500 a room per night to well over $100,000 a week, Hendry said. The situation is different for the people who work on the island.
“St. Barts is like a ski village with a 10-month season -- lots of young kids who work hard and play hard,” he said. “No one can normally afford to buy a house; there is no such thing as affordable homes.”
This dilemma was compounded by Hurricane Irma, which battered St. Barts in 2017, damaging a lot of properties, reducing the housing stock and pushing rents higher.
“There is a clear and evident demand for capital to come in and eliminate the shortage,” Hendry said.
Years of mediocre returns and investor withdrawals have diminished job prospects in the $3 trillion hedge-fund industry, forcing some of its best-known names to quit. While many return after a break to launch new funds, others have branched out into everything from picking winners in the marijuana industry to selling sandwiches.
Hendry’s hedge fund churned out a 31% return by betting against U.S. and European banks during the 2008 financial crisis. He also attracted attention for his bearish view on China in 2009, when he posted videos on YouTube in which he toured cities and identified office buildings that he said had no tenants. Then in 2017, Hendry packed it in, saying the macro hedge fund model was broken.
An outspoken Scot known for his contrarian views, Hendry first worked for Edinburgh investment manager Baillie Gifford, then moved on to Credit Suisse Group AG. He joined hedge-fund manager Crispin Odey in 1999 before breaking away to form his own firm, Eclectica Asset Management.

France’s top court denied an appeal by a Geneva trader charged with insider trading who argued that the country’s laws didn’t cover certain types of derivatives.
The Cour de Cassation dismissed the constitutional challenge lodged by Lucien Selce, who was charged as part of French investigations into trades before 2016 related to chemical producer Airgas Inc. and oilfield surveyor CGG SA. He argued that the law on insider trading was was vaugue before it was modified three years ago to include derivatives known as Contracts for Difference.
The law “is sufficiently clear and precise” to prevent any risk of an arbitrary interpretation, judges at the Cour de Cassation said in their ruling dated July 10, but released only this week.
The charges in the CGG case came to light two years ago when, in a separate court proceeding, Selce’s lawyer contested methods investigators used to trace his client’s trips to a luxury Alpine ski resort and the island of Corsica. The Swiss resident is among a group of seven men who have been charged in France in connection with trading ahead of Paris-based Air Liquide SA’s $10 billion takeover of Airgas four years ago. All have denied the charges.
CFDs allow a person to bet on a company’s stock without owning shares. With a relatively small down payment, profits and losses can exceed those when buying shares. Many countries have restricted their sale because retail investors can underestimate the risks and incur outsize losses.
Selce’s lawyer, Frederic Peltier, criticized the ruling.
“Should we blindly trust judges to understand the scope of a law that might have an unlimited reach?” he asked. “This decision is the antithesis of what a constitutional check on the precision of laws should be.”
Selce, the co-founder of Geneva-based Vista Capital Management SA, is suspected of having illegally made nearly 8 million euros ($8.9 million) on the Airgas trades. His gains in the CGG transactions, which his lawyer has said took place between 2014 and 2015, aren’t publicly known.

I became a real cross-country skier a decade ago, on the eve of a big race. I stood before the register at my local ski shop, coveting a matchbook-size, yellow sliver of ski wax priced at $5 a gram, feeling my pulse race, my fingers quavering as I thrilled over the glory and speed this little wafer of magic could bring once I ironed it into the base of my skis. I laid down a hundred bucks for that wax, and I’m almost certain I covered 50 kilometers a few minutes faster thanks to it. How could I not have? Fluorinated ski wax is so eerily effective that, in describing it, fellow skiers at times drift toward the rhetoric of religion. “It’s the most joyous thing I’ve ever experienced,” Andrew Gardner, until recently the head coach of Nordic skiing at Middlebury College, says of gliding on fluorinated boards. “It’s so completely unnatural.”
The fastest fluoro wax contains a synthetic fluorine-based compound—perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, which boasts eight fully fluorinated carbon molecules in its long backbone. The compound’s star is fluorine. This element forms a tighter chemical bond with carbon than any other, and it creates, essentially, a shield against the ski-slowing moisture that pervades snow most thoroughly when temperatures approach or rise above 32F. Fluorine is exquisitely unreactive; it scarcely sticks to anything. That’s why PFOAs are a key ingredient in Teflon. When firefighters spray foam laced with PFOAs onto a blaze, it has a suffocating effect.
As you might have guessed, PFOAs are bad for the environment. Numerous studies have noted contaminated drinking water near airports because of the PFOA-laced firefighting foam used to put out airplane fires. And in 2010, after Sweden’s Vasaloppet, the world’s biggest Nordic ski contest, with 30,000 entrants, scientists tested the snow and soil and found them tainted with fluorocarbons, which have been linked to cancer, liver damage, birth defects, hypertension, and strokes.
In July 2020 the European Chemicals Agency will ban the sale, manufacture, and import of all products containing PFOAs. Slightly less toxic and less miraculous to skiers, with a backbone containing just six fully fluorinated carbon molecules, C6 fluorocarbon seems poised to become illegal in Europe in 2022. Meanwhile, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is investigating numerous U.S. wax purveyors, including Swix Sport USA, whose Norwegian parent company, Swix Inc., makes about 60% of all fluoro ski wax worldwide.
Swix Sports USA denied a request to discuss the EPA’s investigation; the EPA said in an emailed statement that certain waxes are in violation of the Toxic Substances Control Act. The agency wouldn’t comment on why some fluoro ski waxes are still being sold in shops and online. “As a matter of policy,” it said, “the agency is unable to discuss compliance monitoring.”
Speculation abounds among skiers that it’s just a matter of time before the EPA outlaws fluoro wax. Since 2009, Swix has been trying to find a more environmentally friendly wax that’s as fast as fluoro. Fast Wax, based in Watertown, Minn., is experimenting, too, and it plans to stop jostling for fluoro wax market share. “Why fight for deck chairs on the Titanic?” says owner Casey Kirt.
In fact, fluoro wax, which made its debut in the late ’80s, has never really been a big moneymaker. It isn’t wildly popular with the downhill skiing masses (over a quick three-minute schuss, its benefits are scant), and it accounts for only about $50 million in annual sales worldwide. Still, fluoro has long cast a troubling haze over the few thousand cold-tolerant ectomorphs who huddle at the core of the Nordic ski universe.
Patrick Weaver, the Nordic coach at the University of Vermont, says that whenever he waxes with fluoro, he dons rubber gloves and wears a $1,200 vacuum-pack face shield replete with toxin-mitigating fans. “The stuff isn’t good for our bodies,” Weaver says as we discuss a 2011 Scandinavian finding that ski technicians had up to 45 times as much fluorocarbon in their blood as nonskiers. “And for me, this is a career.”
Thanks to Weaver, fluoro wax is now banned from most Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association races. Many U.S. high school leagues likewise allow only cheaper, slower hydrocarbon-based wax, in part because pricey fluoro advantages wealthier athletes. The bans are tough to enforce, though, since there’s no inexpensive way to test whether a ski is fluorinated. Last year, after the Norwegian Ski Federation banned fluoro from all races for kids 16 and younger, it paid a lab about $6,000 to swab 48 skis, one each from 48 youth racers. Twelve skis carried “strong indications” they’d been treated with fluorine; 12 more carried “indications.” Do these results mean that Norwegian children are disproportionately evil? Not necessarily. The nascent test is hypersensitive; even using a fluorocarbon-tainted wax brush on a ski could yield “strong indications” of cheating.
The governing body of Nordic skiing’s World Cup circuit, the Fédération Internationale de Ski, has no plans to prohibit fluoro use. Key World Cup races draw about 14 million European television viewers. The world’s top Nordic skiers, Johannes Klaebo and Therese Johaug, both Norwegian, make about $1 million a year. With this kind of lucre at stake, a question looms: What sort of desperate measures will the pros take when fluorinated wax is illegal to bring into Europe, where most races are held?
Some ski savants are battening down for a dystopian future. “I’ve got to believe there’s going to be a black market,” says Gardner, the ex-coach, who now runs a Vermont-based sports marketing firm. “Will people cheat?” asks one ski store owner, begging for anonymity. “I know they’re capable of it, because I sell the wax.”
Myself, of late, I’ve been thinking about this half-used bar of fluoro that sits in my basement, glinting like a contraband gemstone. The European Chemicals Agency advises against taking fluoro to a landfill (it’ll just leech), so I’m going to use it in my next race. Why not? One more hit of eerie, unnatural speed—that’s all I ask, just one more hit. This story is from Bloomberg Businessweek’s special issue The Elements.

The bigger Anta Sports Products Ltd. becomes, the more vulnerable it feels. That’s the tight rope China’s largest athletic-apparel producer is walking as it expands beyond the Asian nation amid the trade war.
“In the past, Anta only focused on the China market and felt little impact,” Lai Shixian, Anta’s chief financial officer, told Bloomberg in Hong Kong. But now with its product sales and supply chain spread all across the globe, “the trade war is having a massive impact on all fronts.”
Anta’s global ambitions come at a tricky time, as an intensifying tit-for-tat tariff war is making it more expensive to manufacture in China -- long considered the world’s workshop. The sportswear maker struck a $5.2 billion deal to acquire Finland’s Amer Sports Oyj in December to boost its overseas business.
The Fujian-based firm already has suppliers in Southeast Asia, according to Lai. If Anta keeps improving its operations, the impact of the trade war could “still be controlled at this point,” he said.
Nike Challenger Says Quarter of China Sportswear Factories Idled
While the trade war has reduced orders for Chinese factories, it has given local brands including Anta more sourcing choices. But Anta’s choice for sourcing partner will not be a simple function of cost, Lai said. Other parameters such as quality and delivery period will also be considered.
Investors have so far cheered Anta’s acquisition of Amer, the maker of Salomon ski boots and Wilson tennis rackets. The company’s shares soared the most since November in Hong Kong trading Tuesday, after Anta reported first-half revenue of 14.8 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) that beat analyst estimates. The stock rose as much as 8.1% to an all-time high, bringing its gain for the year to 76%."

Citigroup’s Ray McGuire spoke about philanthropy and finance at what he called the “Davos of the Hamptons,” a series of panels convened by the Milken Institute.
Eric Mindich spent some time with Joe Biden at a campaign fundraiser in Water Mill. Of President Trump’s G-7 trip, Biden said, “He’s overseas and over skis -- way over.”
David Solomon spun at the Fire Pit at Gurney’s.
While deejaying, being a thought leader and meeting the Democratic front-runner all have their merits, it’s probably safe to say Solomon had the most fun by conventional definitions: He was literally surrounded by fire, steps from the ocean, choosing the music.
And in his particular spot, he had the most power -- in charge of creating a vibe Saturday night for a critical 90 minutes of partying, as the clock struck midnight. He pulled it off, too.
Before he arrived in the DJ booth, the crowd was gabbing around the giant fire pit, checking one another out, as millennials and those aspiring to date them do. Once Solomon was at the turntables, dozens of people flocked in front of the booth and started dancing, heeding the advice of one sample, “Follow Me.” They sang along to “Twist and Shout” and “Girls Like You.”
These junior people in finance know Solomon is the chief executive of Goldman Sachs. They’ve seen him spin in Brooklyn. They asked to take photos with him. And they wanted to know where to buy the D-Sol baseball caps that a group of Solomon’s friends had shown up in. (Not only are they not for sale, the guy who had them made only ordered 144.)

Some of the lyrics that Solomon spun into the night air: “I feel you in my bones;” “got to be real” (thank you Cheryl Lynn); “ain’t no mountain high” (omitting “enough” -- because in the Hamptons, there is never enough?); and “Baby we can do it, take the time, do it right.”

Watching Solomon mouth “whoop whoop” was an unforgettable moment. He sampled Justin Timberlake’s “SexyBack.” He played his remix of Fleetwood Mac’s “Don’t Stop” and “Feel Alive” featuring Katt Rockell. And there was a smidge of “Heaven” by Bryan Adams, who had played in person in Water Mill earlier in the evening at a gala for the Prostate Cancer Foundation hosted by Michael Milken.
There, Milken said he’d flown in early Wednesday to visit with David Koch before he died. “David and I have teamed up on many things over 25 years, and I brought pictures to show his children,” Milken said. “He was soft-spoken, he had a great laugh. He was self-deprecating. And if you want to talk about New York, you go to the Metropolitan Museum, it’s David Koch, you want to go to Memorial Sloan Kettering, it’s David Koch.”
On Wednesday night, Milken was at Leon Black’s house in Southampton meeting with rising leaders. Thursday brought a session on criminal justice, Saturday one on job creation. But the focus of the gala was medical research.
“Medical research is bipartisan,” Milken said, recalling the support of various Republican and Democratic administrations. “It’s also bipartisan between China and the United States.”

As couples get married later than their parents’ generation, so goes the binge-drinking bacchanals in place of more substantive, luxury getaways .
Bachelor and bachelorette parties may be synonymous with wild debauchery, signaling the end of singledom with outrageous antics nobody dares remember the next morning. But now that most Americans are getting married later than their parents’ generation, the reality is more: Been there, done that.
“People are shifting away from that narrative of, this is your last days as a single person,” says New York-based event planner Dawn Mauberret. Prenuptial gatherings are less and less focused on booze-filled escapades and more about escaping the pressures of modern life, with a trip centered around food and wellness activities. “It’s more about spending quality time with friends and family.” 
Consider the data: The average age for a first marriage in 2018 was 27.8 years for women and 29.8 years for men, according to the most recent estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. In comparison, the average age was 23.9 years and 26.1 years, respectively, in 1990.
That means most bachelors and bachelorettes have had the majority of their 20s to explore their wild sides if they wanted to. (Some don’t; studies show millennials are spending less on alcohol than previous generations.) With age comes maturity, and with maturity generally comes money, and today’s bachelor and bachelorettes want to step it up a notch—whatever that means to them. 
Litty Samuel, a 33-year-old executive producer at Meredith Corp. in New York, opted for a four-day international getaway for her bachelorette trip in November 2017. She and six friends  visited Iceland, where they lounged in the famed Blue Lagoon, hiked to hot springs, and  scuba-dived between tectonic plates. “As I grew older, I partied less and less,” she says. “The more I thought about it, I didn’t know if I want to put on a little dress and go out and wear a bunch of plastic penises around my neck. If I could get a group of girlfriends together, I wanted to hike and experience nature with them instead.” 
Jenna Miller, creative director at wedding website Here Comes the Guide, says she’s seeing an uptick in the use of bespoke luxury planning services such as Bach to Basics or Luxury Bachelorette. These couples are using private jets with personal chefs to take their parties to the destinations, which may include the Saguaro Palm Springs, with its pool parties, in-house spa, and daily yoga classes, and Carneros Resort and Spa or Solage Calistoga for wine tasting.
“It’s more sophisticated than a Las Vegas pool party,” she says. “It’s more chic and kind of more adult to go to Napa and do your spa treatment.”
It’s also pricier.
 
The average bachelor or bachelorette party attendee spends $537, including the cost of travel, accommodations, and gifts. And it’s even more for a luxury getaway; a destination party in New York City could cost guests more than $1,900. (About 35% of millennials have gone into debt to attend a bachelor or bachelorette party, according to a survey by Credit Karma.)
These more luxurious trips are also longer than the typical one-night party that past generations favored. According to data from Wedding Wire, one in three bachelor or bachelorette parties take place for three or more days. 
With friend groups so often dispersed geographically, a longer pre-wedding party has become a necessity of sorts, “especially if your groomsmen or bridesmaids don’t know each other,” says Jamie Chang, destination wedding planner for Mango Muse Events.
The strict male-female divide typical of stag and hen parties of years past is also changing. 
“Something that was really important to me, and I think this goes along of being in my 30s, was that the party was made up of people from all different points in my lives,” says Jenna Citron, a 32-year-old bride in New York who works as the executive director of nonprofit Queens College Hillel. This meant that inviting her best friend Jon from high school along for her bachelorette was natural, given that he’s also a member of her bridal party. 
“At my age, I couldn’t imagine going and doing a strip-club, glitter-filled drink fest. It’s not who I am,” she says of planning her four-day trip to Disney World next month, ahead of her November wedding.
“Up until recently it’s always been a very gendered affair,” Mauberret says. But now, most adults, especially those in their late 20s or 30s, have close friends of both genders.
This is especially the case with same-sex marriages, which are on the rise, with 10.2% of LGBTQ Americans married to a same-sex spouse in 2017, compared to 7.9% in 2015, during the months before the Supreme Court’s legalization of gay marriage, according to a Gallup survey. In 2017, 61% of same sex couples were married, up from 38% before the ruling.
One in 10 couples is even opting for a joint party, says Kim Forrest, senior editor at Wedding Wire, starting the night with separate activities and then meeting up later in the evening.
“The wedding party isn’t divided up by gender [anymore], so why should your bachelor or bachelorette party be?” Forrest says. “It also opens it up to having family members be part of it.” 
Brides- and grooms-to-be are also seeking out more adrenaline-boosting activities than in the past, says Nikki Clause, founder and creative planner of Fling Before the Ring. Requests for workout classes such as yoga and kickboxing are common from her female clients; recently, she arranged for a group in Detroit to attend a private aerialist class at a local circus school. “We just thought that was totally out of the box and so different,” she says.   
Bachelor parties, especially, are skewing toward more adventurous themes, says Michelle Lang, president of party planning service Before the Knot.She recently planned an outing at the Ritz-Carlton Reynolds, Lake Oconee, where the guys went skeet shooting and fishing and rode ATVs. She’s also arranged axe-throwing and exotic car racing in Miami. Montana is a popular destination as well, Lang adds, for its horseback riding and hiking opportunities. She recommends staying at the Paws Up Resort outside Missoula. 
 “More actual, substantive trips,” is how Leah Weinberg, owner and creative director of Color Pop Events, sums it all up. She’s planned several nature-focused vacations in such places as Jackson Hole, Wyo., where attendees can ski and hike. If none of those options sounds appealing, some couples are choosing to skip the prenuptial getaway altogether.
“I think that with age comes being a little more wise about money and not wanting to blow their money on a bachelorette party,” Weinburg says. “At this age, maybe they’re saving to put a down payment on a house.”

The prime minister will tell German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron that the EU must offer a new deal or face Britain leaving the bloc without one.
The British Parliament “will not, and cannot, cancel the referendum,” his office said in a statement on Saturday.
Johnson will visit Berlin and Paris on Aug. 21 and Aug. 22 in his first overseas trip since becoming leader. The visit comes ahead of the Group of Seven summit in France.
His warning comes amid a report that the government is preparing for a three-month ""meltdown"" at British ports, a hard Irish border and shortages of food and medicine. These represent the “most likely aftershocks"" of a no-deal Brexit, according to the Sunday Times, which cited leaked government documents. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister in charge of no-deal planning, said “Operation Yellowhammer” represented a “worst-case scenario.”
Britain is heading for a no-deal Brexit at a time when fears are mounting for the global economy amid the escalating trade clash between the U.S. and China.
The pound fell to its lowest levels since the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote this month and the U.K. economy shrank for the first time in more than six years between April and June. Johnson is under growing pressure to recall Parliament from its summer recess to discuss the Brexit crisis.
The EU has ruled out renegotiating the thrice-rejected deal it struck with his predecessor, Theresa May. The agreement stalled in Parliament over how to keep the Irish border open, with the EU insisting on a “backstop” that would tie Britain closely to the bloc.
The standoff leaves opponents of a no-deal Brexit just weeks to find a way to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc, an event that business leaders and many economists say would trigger economic chaos.
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, renewed his appeal to lawmakers opposed to a no-deal departure to let him head a caretaker government, a proposal that has so far failed to gain widespread support.
“My message to MPs across Parliament is simple and urgent: only by working together can we stop no-deal,” Corbyn told the Observer newspaper. “Three years after the EU referendum, the country stands at a precipice. Boris Johnson has become prime minister without any popular mandate. He has no right to drive our country off a cliff and into the arms of Donald Trump with his no-deal fixation.”
The Mail on Sunday meanwhile cited a leaked letter in which Johnson accused those trying to stop a no-deal Brexit of making it harder to reach a new deal with the EU.
Johnson said the EU ""will simply not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that Parliament can block Brexit on Oct. 31.” The comments are being seen as an attack on former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who has said he is confident Parliament will come up with a way to stop a no-deal Brexit.
Johnson has said Parliament could be suspended in order to deliver Brexit. But on Sunday, prominent anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller said the government now accepts such a move would be illegal. Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday show, Miller said she will be seeking reassurance that lawmakers would be able to pass legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit.
In a move designed to underscore the government’s commitment to leaving, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Sunday announced that he had signed an order to scrap the 1972 Brussels Act, effectively ending all EU law in the U.K. on Oct. 31.
“This is a clear signal to the people of this country that there is no turning back,” Barclay said in a statement.
Johnson will meet world leaders at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, starting Aug. 24. His talks with Merkel and Macron are expected to revolve around foreign policy and security as well as the global economy and trade.
“The EU are our closest neighbors and whatever happens we want a strong relationship after we leave,” his office said.

Outdoor gearheads will find the New Zealand-based company’s packs, parkas, and sleeping bags for the first time in 25 stores, including REI and Walmart’s Moosejaw. It’s a bold move into a cold, crowded market.
For the unfamiliar, Kathmandu is basically a down-under version of Patagonia with about $350 million in annual revenue. It makes its own gear, sells it primarily in the 170 stores it has across Australia and New Zealand, and funnels a ton of returns into environmental initiatives. The main difference between the two is that Kathmandu is publicly traded. So it has to be circumspect about things like suing the Trump administration or splashy global growth.
Kathmandu planned its U.S. expedition like any self-respecting climber: fast and cheap. It set up a base camp of sorts last year when it bought Oboz Footwear, a Bozeman, Mont., company, for $60 million. The deal brought in house a line of hiking boots, one of the few products the company didn't yet design and make.
More importantly, though, Oboz instantly extended the Kiwi company’s supply chain across the Pacific Ocean—the global equivalent of last-mile delivery. It suddenly had a North American sales team, warehouse, distribution center, and marketing department; it even had a bunch of accounts. The U.S. sales pitch flipped from a cold call to “what else can I interest you in?”
“The difficulty was in having the infrastructure,” Xavier Simonet, Kathmandu's chief executive officer, tells me. “It’s literally about having an office, a bank account, and the opportunity to leverage their knowledge in wholesale.”
Building all of that would likely have been more expensive than buying it, and certainly more fraught. “We’re actually not keen to spend a lot of money,” Simonet says, deadpanning.
At the same time, the big names in U.S. outdoor apparel are “over-distributed,” he argues. For Kathmandu, North America is unchartered, which gives the company a chance to cherry-pick the healthiest retailers. It doesn't have to bother with discount outlets or department stores. (Just, perhaps, the fact that when most Americans hear “Kathmandu,” they think of a Bob Seger song, and not the best one). 
Kathmandu's ads will focus on the company’s sustainability commitment, which is a fast-appreciating asset in part because of Patagonia’s work in creating a more woke marketplace. And then there’s the Kiwi origin story, which holds a fair share of romance for those who ski, hike, fish, or watch Lord of the Rings films.
“In the outdoor category, there’s always space for new, exciting brands,” Simonet says. “And New Zealand is quite a fascinating country for a lot of people.”"

“It was pure dread,” said Tsuei, now 23. “It was like I was sentenced to death. I just counted down the days.”
Still, he knew it was his “duty” to study at all-boys Eaglebrook School in Deerfield. His brother also matriculated there as part of what Tsuei, who hails from Taiwan, described as the first step in preparing for the college-admissions sweepstakes.
Eaglebrook School commencement
Wealthy Asian families have long viewed U.S. universities as a golden ticket to help ensure their children’s futures, but a growing number are looking to get an early edge on the competition. More and more families, increasingly from China, are sending their kids across the Pacific to attend “junior” boarding schools. While few in number, these exclusive middle schools -- which can charge as much as $74,000 a year -- offer a potential route into top private high schools that feed the most prestigious universities.
“It’s only natural that the next step was for those families to look at the junior boarding schools, because they felt like it would give them an upper hand,” said Rick Dickson, managing partner at Dunbar Consultants, a New York-based educational consulting firm.
The size of this niche market is hard to quantify. At the Fay School, the number of foreign applicants for the upper boarding school (grades 7 through 9) has grown steadily in recent years, according to data provided by the Southborough, Massachusetts-based institution, while American applicants have remained relatively flat. The same “exponential growth” has been seen at Deerfield’s Bement School, according to Head of School Chris Wilson. Eaglebrook, meanwhile, has seen such an influx from China that it established a program to assess English language proficiency and filter Chinese applicants, said Admissions Director Christopher Loftus, who declined to give specific numbers.
John Rao, now 21, was among the pioneers. China’s rigid, examination-based education system wasn’t the right fit for Rao when he was 13, so his father, who ran a tech company, looked into him studying abroad. A decade ago, it was rare for families to send their kids halfway around the world so young. But for Rao, attending Hillside School in Marlborough, Massachusetts, seemed too good an opportunity to pass up.
In his local school in Shenzhen, “my grades were fine, but I couldn’t see myself doing a lot of things I liked to do,” said Rao, who went on to enroll at Westminster School in Simsbury, Connecticut, and now attends Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
East Asian students make up the majority of international secondary students, but the growth is driven primarily by China and South Korea. In 2018, despite slowing growth, Chinese students made up 37% of all international secondary students in the U.S., according to a presentation from the Institute of International Education.
Despite a recent slowdown, China still sends the most students to the U.S.

Tsuei’s alma mater boasts an endowment of $100 million, according to website Boarding School Review, and an 800-acre campus that includes its own ski slope. Other schools, such as Fay, Bement and Rumsey Hall, also have eight-digit endowments and bucolic campuses that rival those of some universities. Fay, the oldest junior boarding school in the U.S., has 10 fields, eight tennis courts, four basketball courts, two outdoor heated pools, two fitness centers, an indoor turf facility and an indoor rock climbing wall, according to its website.

But one of the main draws is the relationships they have with some of the most competitive private high schools, Dunbar Consultants’ Dickson said. Many graduates go on to attend such schools as Phillips Academy Andover, Phillips Exeter Academy, Choate Rosemary Hall and Deerfield Academy.
“We all knew, implicitly,” said Tsuei, who later attended Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut, and New York University. “Almost the first thing we hear is: ‘Which high school do you want to go to?’”
At Cardigan Mountain School in Canaan, New Hampshire, about 80 private secondary schools send representatives to meet with prospective students each fall. High school admissions directors often visit personally, sometimes dining with ninth graders to chat informally about their plans, according to the Bement School.
“After attending junior boarding school in America, many students go on to enroll in some of the most competitive secondary schools in the world,” according to the Fay School’s website. “In turn, these top high schools are considered ‘feeder’ schools for Ivy League colleges such as Harvard, Princeton and Yale.”
Beyond country-club amenities and academic connections, such schools also offer foreign students the opportunity to learn in more flexible environments than many of their home countries, while also getting an early acclimation to U.S. culture. That can range from something as subtle as understanding references to “The Simpsons” to gearing up in preppy Vineyard Vines fashions.
Many of Rao and Tsuei’s classmates were sons of high-ranking executives at global conglomerates, they said, and stories about lavish vacations and private jets highlighted the wealth at Eaglebrook. Parents who send their children to junior boarding schools are often successful entrepreneurs who were also educated abroad and understood the value of having a U.S. diploma, said Yuan-Hsiu Lien, who teaches Chinese at Eaglebrook.
“In many ways, you’re in this small pond with big fish,” Tsuei said. “But not because the pond is relatively small, it’s because they’re actually big.”
But leaving one’s family so young can be challenging. For the longest time, Tsuei said he yearned to go home.
“Sometimes I would feel like, ‘Why do people like us, people like smart kids from Taiwan or other parts of Asia, need to come here in order to feel like they could get a better chance in life?’” Tsuei said. “Isn’t it enough to stay in Asia?”

The investment firm’s Wealthsimple to Advisors unit will provide technology, dealer and advisory services to Grayhawk Investment Strategies Inc., a Calgary-based firm that manages about C$800 million ($600 million) for 30 of Canada’s richest families. Wealthsimple will then offer Grayhawk strategies to advisers with wealthy clients on its platform.

“We still are often thought of as a young millennial shop, and even in our adviser business a lot of people think of us as a ‘Mom and Pop’ adviser,” Wealthsimple Chief Executive Officer Mike Katchen said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. “But this is a very ultra high-net-worth professional shop that’s been growing very fast -- it’s only four years old -- that understand the value of a platform like ours.”
The move is all part of Katchen’s plan to transform the Toronto-based firm into a broad-based financial services company. It has been rolling out new offerings, including commission-free trading, and Katchen’s ambitions could include checking accounts, credit lines, mortgages and life insurance.
“We think that there is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build that kind of platform, based here in Canada, but expanding it around the world,” Katchen, 31, said. “It’s pretty obvious where we’re going to go: we want to be the mainstay of our clients’ financial lives.”
Wealthsimple, 67%-owned by the Desmarais family’s Power Financial Corp., has more than C$5 billion in assets under management and 175,000 customers in Canada, the U.S. and U.K. He sees that reaching C$1 trillion 15 years.
“We’re just getting started,” he said. “Our plans are to get to millions of clients in the next five years.”
The company has about 400 advisers and a number of firms already using this wealth-management platform. Grayhawk becomes the first major family office to adopt it.
Wealthsimple was one of the first robo-advisers in Canada when it launched in September 2014, getting a jump on Canada’s big banks and other fintech rivals in automated investing, which emerged about a decade ago in the U.S.
In addition to the Desmarais, the company has gained support from Allianz SE. But Wealthsimple is not yet profitable, Katchen said.
“But that’s only a couple years away and we’ve got the partners that are totally supportive of the strategy that we’re employing to grow,” he said. An initial public offering is also “a few years away.”
“I am interested in it because, to me, it’s the only long-term viable path towards us achieving our vision of building an independent, long-standing, self-sufficient financial-services company,” he said. “But we’re not in a rush to do it.”
Katchen’s first taste in investing was when he was 12 years old, when his sister entered him into a stock-picking contest. He won, and earned a free ski trip in British Columbia. He became interested in investing, and started reading up.
He later moved to California to help friends build a technology company 1000Memories that was later sold to Ancestry.com. Those proceeds helped launch Wealthsimple.
His belief was that everyone should be able to manage their own money. He built a spreadsheet to show his friends how to create their own portfolios and rebalance them, telling them they now had everything they needed to be successful investors.
“The feedback was, ‘Mike, we love the approach but we’re lazy, just do it for us’,” Katchen said. “They became the first clients of Wealthsimple.”

Comcast Corp.’s European business Sky plans to show top soccer matches in Germany on a pay-per-view basis, pushing beyond its fixed subscription model in an effort to entice younger fans, according to people familiar with the matter. 
A partnership with digital platform Onefootball could go ahead close to the beginning of the new season on Friday and would cover German Cup and second-division Bundesliga 2 games, said one of the people. It would mark the first time that Sky has offered viewers anywhere the opportunity to watch a single match for a one-time fee. 
Sky has long used its all-you-can-watch elite soccer packages to lure viewers to its entertainment and news channels. Its billionaire founder Rupert Murdoch told other shareholders in his company News Corp. in 1996 that he intended to use sport as a “battering ram” to expand his global pay-TV network.
Europe’s biggest satellite-TV broadcaster began testing a more flexible approach in 2012 when it launched streaming service Now TV, allowing consumers to build their own packages from their favorite programs and sports.
Murdoch quit the scene last year with the takeover of Sky by U.S. media giant Comcast, and future growth of the business will hinge on reaching modern viewers who are used to picking from an array of digital media and want flexible, easily-accessible ways to consume soccer.
Under the partnership with Onefootball, Sky would allow the Berlin-based digital platform to show single matches and share the fee revenue with Sky, said the people, who asked not to be named as the plans are not public and the deal has not been signed. A match would cost between 3 euros ($3.34) and 4 euros, one of the people said. Representatives for Sky and Onefootball declined to comment.
The Bundesliga season kicks off Friday with Bayern Munich defending its title by playing host to Hertha Berlin.
Sky has amassed around 5 million subscribers in Germany with a mix of blockbuster movies, hit TV shows such as “Game of Thrones” and exclusive Bundesliga and Champions League rights.
New digital rivals are challenging its dominance. Billionaire Len Blavatnik’s streaming company DAZN last month secured a deal with Discovery Inc.’s Eurosport for live rights to some of the Bundesliga. Its packages, which also include Austrian and Italian soccer, women’s tennis and NBA basketball, cost 9.99 euros a month.
DAZN plans to raise prices in Germany by 20% to 11.99 euros following the Eurosport deal. Sky’s main Bundesliga package costs 25 euros a month for the upcoming season.
Onefootball first offered a pay-per-view service in the U.K. in April, when it teamed up with rights holder Eleven Sports to show Spanish La Liga matches for 2.99 pounds a match.
“Modern football fans are challenging the status quo,” Onefootball founder and Chief Executive Officer Lucas von Cranach said at the time. “They want to be empowered to consume live content in a more flexible, easily accessible way.”

Massive layers of ice cover some of the continent’s rich copper deposits. Uncovering those minerals threatens to hasten their demise.
Government geologist Gino Casassa steps down from the helicopter and looks around in dismay.
Casassa is standing at the foot of a glacier, 4,200 meters (13,800 feet) above sea level. The sky over the Andes is a deep blue, but something is not right: It’s July—mid-winter in South America—and yet it’s mild for the time of year, above 0 degrees Centigrade. He takes off his orange ski jacket and walks on the bare rock.
“This should all be covered by snow this time of year,” he says, pointing to Olivares Alfa, one of the largest glaciers in central Chile, just a few meters away. “There used to be one single glacier system covering this whole valley; now it’s pulled back so much that it’s divided into four or five smaller glaciers.”
Chile has one of the world’s largest reserves of fresh water outside the north and south poles, but the abundant glaciers that are the source of that precious commodity are melting fast. That’s not just an ecological disaster in the making, it’s rapidly becoming an economic and political dilemma for the government of Latin America’s richest nation.
A toxic cocktail of rising temperatures, the driest nine-year period on record and human activity, including mining, is proving lethal for the ice of Chile’s central region. Built up over thousands of years, the ice mass is now retreating one meter per year on average. 
Less than two decades from now, some glaciers will have disappeared, while the total volume of all glaciers in Chile will have shrunk by half by the end of the century, says Casassa. That’s an acute problem since Chile, which has 80% of South America’s glaciers, is also the Americas country most at risk of extremely high water stress, according to the World Resources Institute. More than 7 million people living in and around the capital, Santiago, rely on the glaciers to feed most of their water supply in times of drought.
Chile’s government is well aware of the issue. A glacier unit was established in 2008 and tasked with producing an inventory of glaciers with the aim of protecting them and raising awareness of their importance. But its resources are limited: it had a staff of just seven last year—Casassa is the unit’s director—and has so far published a single register of glaciers, in 2014, using decade-old data. The unit is due to issue a second inventory later this year allowing the first ever comparison of all Chile’s glaciers. 
Not everyone is content to wait. An opposition bill now before parliament aims to lock in legal protection for glaciers. But President Sebastian Pinera’s center-right government has come out against it, arguing that if implemented, the measures would harm Chile’s economic development, and specifically its lucrative mining industry.
Glaciers happen to cover some of the massive copper deposits that make Chile the world’s largest producer of the metal, with about a third of the world’s copper output coming from its mines each year. Mining is key to Chile’s economy, making up 10% of its gross domestic product and comprising just over half its exports. 
That economic reality is at the heart of the government’s quandary, evaluating the trade-offs required to protect the environment while supporting an industry worth some $19 billion to the economy. Chile’s minister for mining, Baldo Prokurica, insists the twin aims are not mutually exclusive.
“Mining can be done without damaging the environment and that’s what we want to do,” Prokurica said in an interview in Santiago, pointing out that countries with similar challenges such as Canada, Norway and the U.S. have higher environmental standards and still manage to mine without a glacier law.
The bill proposes all glaciers and their surroundings become protected areas, bans non-scientific interventions and considers any violations of the rules to be crimes. That’s too broad brush for Chile’s government, which plans its own environmental legislation. “I believe in preserving the glaciers, but also in mining,” said Prokurica.
Pinera’s minority government is still on the back foot over the bill in the same year that it’s due to host the United Nations COP25 climate change summit, making it an easy target for charges of hypocrisy by opponents. 
“If they don’t support the glacier bill, it will show their bid for COP was playing to the gallery,” says Guido Girardi, the opposition senator who sponsored the legislation. “We’re facing a catastrophe and not protecting glaciers is not an option anymore.”
Glaciers have long been the bane of the mining industry. During the 1970s, state-owned copper miner Codelco removed glaciers covering a rich deposit in the mountains northwest of the capital to allow development of its Andina mine. At a time when Chile had almost no environmental protections, the act was celebrated as a great feat of engineering. 
Scientific advances mean that it’s now known glaciers help lower temperatures and increase air humidity for a 50-kilometer (30-mile) radius. They’re also the reason that rivers in central Chile carry about the same volume of water during the current extreme drought as in normal conditions. In a dry year, as much as two-thirds of the water in river systems feeding Santiago comes from the glaciers high up in the Andes.
The upshot is that as drought conditions become more prevalent from Cape Town to Chennai in India, Chile remains relatively sheltered. Some 70% of the country’s population of 18 million lives in areas where glaciers make the difference.
But that natural safety net is coming under increasing strain. While most mines in Chile are in the country’s northern Atacama desert, miners are moving south in search of newer and richer deposits—and encountering glaciers on the way. 
“Requests to explore and mine in areas with a large presence of glaciers are only increasing,” said Francisco Ferrando, a glaciologist and professor at Universidad de Chile in Santiago.
Most of Chile’s glaciers are in the southern Patagonia region, and while a few are located inside national parks and hence protected, the majority aren’t, meaning that any intervention is treated on a case-by-case basis. White glaciers, where the ice is in direct contact with air, enjoy wider protection than less well-known rock glaciers—masses of frozen water that have sat beneath layers of rock for millennia.

An academic paper from 2010 found that a third of all rock glaciers in central Chile had been directly impacted by mining activities such as road building, drilling platforms and depositing waste on top of the ice. In addition, dust from trucks and explosions in pits as well as vibrations from heavy machinery accelerate the melting. Mining itself is water intensive since it’s needed in each step to produce copper, with usage forecast to rise.
Almost every large mining company operating in Chile has impacted glaciers, including Anglo American Plc. at its Los Bronces mine and Antofagasta Plc. at Los Pelambres, according to the paper.
Anglo American’s Los Bronces operation and Codelco’s Andina mine are exploiting the world’s largest copper deposit in the Andes, about 40 miles from Santiago. Only a rock ridge separates them from the Olivares Alfa glacier. The two giant pits, the mining trucks and dust from the explosions are clearly visible from a helicopter. 
With both companies planning new billion-dollar projects to maintain production at current levels, alarm bells have been set off among environmentalists, who say that mining is hastening the process of desertification.
It’s a charge miners reject. Joaquin Villarino, the president of industry group, Mining Council, has said that glaciers are shrinking because of climate change, and that pollution from transport and other industrial activities in Santiago are also having an impact. The glacier bill contains “serious errors,” he said. 
All the same, miners are taking action. While Codelco is doing early engineering work on an expansion of its open-cast Andina mine, its sister mine, Los Bronces, will go partly underground in a $3 billion plan to avoid impact on the surface. 
Owner Anglo American “acknowledges the importance of glaciers and has the conviction that mining activity and the preservation of the environment can coexist,” the company said in an emailed response to questions. Codelco declined to comment on its plans for Andina.
Pinera’s administration is going on the offensive. Approval of the glacier bill would force four mines including Andina and Los Bronces to halt operations, costing billions of dollars and more than 34,500 jobs, according to a report by the government’s copper commission Cochilco. Copper output would fall by 11% through 2030, impacting global metals markets, it said. 
Casassa, the geologist, sees the impact of climate change accelerating but shares the government’s assessment that there is no need for specific glacier legislation. 
The government may be powerless to stop the bill, however, since it lacks a majority in either chamber of parliament. Lawmaker Girardi says it could clear both the senate and chamber of deputies by early next year, an outcome he sees as of global significance. 
“All the changes we are seeing, all the climate catastrophes across the world are just the beginning,” Girardi said. “Chile’s glaciers are strategic, not just for our country, but for all humanity.”

A $139 billion industrial behemoth looks toward the future.
It’s not quite what you’d expect from a Koch. Certainly not before the gray-haired Rotary Club in Wichita, Kansas.
But there was Chase Koch, scion of one of America’s mightiest private industrial dynasties—a family revered by the political right, reviled by the left and feared by just about everyone—joking about his knock-about years down in Texas.
It was back in the early 2000s, Chase said, after he graduated with a marketing degree from the proudly anti-Ivy League Texas A&M (His father, Charles, and uncle, David, studied engineering at MIT, as did his grandfather, Fred). Reluctant to tap the Koch network for a job, he was hunting for work, banging out Led Zeppelin covers with his band and, as he put it, “screwing around in Austin.”
Times change—and, with time, the Kochs do, too. Chase, 42, now sits on the board of Koch Industries and is president of Koch Disruptive Technologies, the conglomerate’s venture-capital arm. He’s at the sharp edge of efforts to prepare for a knowledge-based future where cheap computers, data and artificial intelligence might threaten the firm’s dominance.
He’s also positioned to control one of the world’s most powerful closely held companies, and represents the future of the conservative political network that has put the Kochs among the country’s most influential families.

Few people are aware of just how big Koch is, or the industries it inhabits. Much as Warren Buffett grew Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from its textile-mill roots, Koch keeps about 90% of its profit and pumps the money back into its businesses or buys new ones. It’s now a sprawling network of subsidiaries reporting back to headquarters in Wichita. They include forestry products (Georgia Pacific), fertilizer (Koch Ag & Energy Solutions), fabrics (Invista), commodities trading (Koch Supply & Trading) and ranching (Matador Cattle).
The brothers invested well. The $21 million company that Charles joined in 1961 is now worth about $139 billion, a 662,000% return, or roughly 16% annually over almost six decades. Charles and David own about 84% of the company (Elaine Marshall owns most of the rest, gaining control of the stake after the 2006 death of her husband, E. Pierce Marshall).

Historically, these investments were in industrial assets—refineries, chemical plants, sawmills.
But over the past few years, they’ve been more futuristic, especially in the venture-capital arm led by Chase Koch. The conglomerate has invested billions of dollars in software, network technology, big data, AI, medical technology and 3D printing.
“It’s actually really smart for them to do this,” said Hans Swildens, chief executive officer of Industry Ventures, which manages more than $3.4 billion of institutional capital. “If you owned a large number of industrial businesses, and you were looking at all the new technologies that were coming out and how they would affect your business, the best thing that you can do is embrace those.”
Jim Hannan, an executive vice president who oversees about half of Koch’s subsidiaries, said tech “has led to a much more common set of issues and opportunities across all our businesses.”
At the same time, big industrials are struggling to grow.
“We are rapidly moving to a digital economy,” said Nick Heymann of William Blair & Co. “Most of the net worth in the last 20 years in this country has been created outside tangible manufacturing businesses.”
For Charles Koch, it was a question of survival. At a 2017 leadership meeting, he pushed his managers to embrace technology and prepare for a knowledge-based future. His message: “Do it or we’ll end up in the Dumpster.”
Falling technology costs are generating new threats to established industries.
There’s “a level of competition that these players did not face,” said Sanjay Agarwal of Boston-based venture-capital fund F-Prime Capital. “Now you can have startups out of a garage building an autonomous vehicle. That was just not possible earlier.”
Cheap computing power and data will fundamentally change every industry, said Koch Chief Financial Officer Steve Feilmeier. The firm said it has invested more than $17 billion in technology companies since 2013, with big bets in cloud computing and enterprise data analytics. Investments have included acquisitions as well as strategic stakes.

If it’s going to be disrupted by a new technology, Koch wants to be doing the disrupting and “investing in it in a way where we better understand it,” Feilmeier said.
The focus on tech isn’t as big a shift as it appears, said Christopher Leonard, author of “Kochland,” a just-released book about the dynasty.
“If you go back to the 1970s, this company was a knowledge company,” he said. “Yes, they owned oil refineries, but they also filled the basement with IBM computers to study the crude-oil market, the gasoline market, to figure out how to run the refineries at the most optimum level.”
Data analytics have been embedded in the Koch DNA for decades, Leonard said. “I’m not at all surprised that they’re making bigger moves into that space. It builds on their expertise.”
Trying to reposition a huge industrial conglomerate around digital technology doesn’t always have a happy ending.
General Electric Co. “made this big effort and got over its ski tips to make itself the platform for industrial digital analytics, and it got way more expensive more quickly” than former CEO Jeff Immelt anticipated, said William Blair’s Heymann.
Byron Trott, the founder of merchant bank BDT Capital Partners, who has worked with Koch for more than 25 years and advised on several acquisitions, doesn’t see it running into the same problems. GE faced short-term pressures that come with being publicly traded, he said, while “Koch is doing this because they are really, really good at thinking long term.”
Chase Koch’s group has made some of the more ambitious bets outside of Koch’s traditional areas of expertise, like investing in InSightec Ltd., a manufacturer of ultrasound-based surgical tools that can eliminate the need for incisions. He’s the only member of the family from the next generation that works at the company. His sister Elizabeth Koch runs a publishing house, Catapult Books, and David’s children are much younger.
Still, Chase took a somewhat unconventional path.
After graduating from Texas A&M, he spent several years in Austin playing in a band covering Led Zeppelin, Phish and the Grateful Dead, and trying to find his way in the city’s tech startup scene. While he previously held summer jobs at Koch, including his first at a cattle ranch at age 15, he spent the years after graduation avoiding his father’s shadow.
“I was too proud to tap into the Koch network,” he told the Wichita Rotarians.
Although he was schooled in his family’s politics from a young age—he recalls Saturdays as a 6-year-old listening to books on tape by Milton Friedman—it’s unclear whether he shares the political philosophy of his father and uncle, who ran for vice president as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1980.
“I start with the idea that to learn and grow, you’ve got to be open to other people’s ideas,” Chase Koch told Politico last year. Politics, while important, is “not at all what I’m passionate about.”
That raises questions about what will become of the Koch political network, which gives his father outsize influence in the U.S. “There is no comparison for any CEO in corporate America in terms of political influence when compared to Charles Koch,” Leonard said.
The Kochs sponsor candidates, think tanks, advocacy groups and academic groups pushing a conservative, free-market agenda.
Recently, there have been disagreements with the Republican Party under President Donald Trump on issues such as free trade and immigration. Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs’ primary political advocacy group, is shifting focus toward “finding nonpartisan solutions,” according to a June memo, and it’s prepared to support candidates who get things done regardless of party.
In July, the Kochs partnered with liberal investor and philanthropist George Soros to found the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a think tank dedicated to promoting peaceful U.S. foreign policy.
Leonard said he isn’t convinced the moves constitute a real change to the Kochs’ political goals.
“It feels like an adaptable reaction to the moment,” he said, “even as Koch keeps its eye on the long-term strategy of doing one thing, which is constraining the reach of the federal government, dismantling the administrative state and pushing back the reach of government as far as possible.”
The political network is “exactly like the corporation,” he said. “It’s run with a long-term view. It has strategic patience.”
When Chase returned to Wichita to rejoin Koch Industries after his years in Austin, he began a rotation of high-level jobs, including stints in mergers and acquisitions, tax structuring, agronomics and trading. It was designed as an MBA-like experience to familiarize him with various parts of the operation.
Koch Industries won’t detail its succession plan beyond saying that one is in place, and that roles are filled by those most qualified.
If Chase eventually succeeds his father in running the firm and the political network, he’ll become one of the country’s most influential people.

That’s because excessive R&D spending can hamper Chinese businesses’ ability to go public. Unlike in the U.S., China’s stock exchanges require companies to be profitable for at least three years before making an initial public offering. R&D spending shows up on income statements as an operating expense and thus keeps young companies in the red for longer.
Starting in late July, technologically ambitious companies can list on a new Nasdaq-style platform: the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s  Science and Technology Innovation Board, colloquially known as STAR, where profitability doesn’t matter. Among the 20 or so industrial and tech companies that have listed there so far, R&D spending averages 12.8% of their 2018 sales, more than double that of their counterparts on the more established exchanges.
STAR stocks  gained 140% on the board’s first day, but the enthusiasm may not last. Chinese investors tend to like plain-vanilla consumer brands, especially after waves of corporate  scandals this year taught them to fear complicated accounting. Han’s Laser Technology Industry Group Co., a supplier of smartphone parts to Apple Inc., was such a market darling that in April, it was valued at more than 30 times earnings. In July state media reported that the company, instead of building a 1 billion-yuan ($142 million) research center as it claimed, was developing a five-star hotel near a ski resort in the Swiss Alps. Han’s Laser is now being investigated for possible misuse of funds (the company says there was no misappropriation), and the stock is worth only half of its 2019 peak of about 45 yuan.
Intangibles are difficult to value everywhere, but that’s particularly true in China, where banks refuse to accept intellectual property as collateral for loans. Last year, as China’s  trade war with the U.S. bit into corporate profit, listed companies wrote down more than 10% of their 1.3 trillion yuan worth of goodwill assets.
It’s laudable that Beijing is trying to bring China Inc. into new fields such as automation and 5G technology, but it has to teach its companies better governance as well. Otherwise they’ll be stuck chasing their competitors’ success—or worse, sitting on a pile of worthless assets and bad debt once the market moves on.
STAR stocks are shining now, but chances are that many of them will fade quickly. Chinese stockholders risk falling into the same trap as investors in the U.S., which still lags behind many of its economic competitors, in viewing “R&D” as code for “pet projects that will never generate value.” Ren is a markets columnist for Bloomberg Opinion

In naming their hedge funds, managers have found inspiration in a childhood neighborhood (Highbridge), favorite ski trails (FrontFour) and even a grandfather (Melvin).
At Och-Ziff Capital Management Inc., executives sought out branding professionals and spent tens of thousands of dollars to come up with a new name: Sculptor Capital Management.
The $33 billion firm chose Sculptor because it ""evokes the dedication, persistence and vision that embody what we strive for daily as stewards of your capital,"" according to a letter sent Monday to investors.
The more practical reason for the change: The New York-based firm decided it needed a reboot to reflect the departure of its founder -- Dan Och. It also helps to distance itself from recent legal troubles that have caused a massive client exodus.
The last five years have proved difficult for Och-Ziff. Clients in its flagship hedge fund have pulled $27 billion since the end of 2014, when the company first disclosed it was the target of a multiyear investigation into bribery in Africa. (It paid a $400 million fine in a settlement.) In subsequent years, top executives left and new leadership was put in place. Och, who founded the firm in 1994, retired as chairman in March.
Och-Ziff joins an array of companies that have changed their names -- sometimes to comic result. Tribune Publishing Co., owner of the Chicago Tribune and the Baltimore Sun, went with Tronc briefly before going back to the Tribune name last year. Blackwater tried Xe Services before settling on Academi. BB&T Corp. and SunTrust Banks Inc. merged recently into Truist.
Rebranding has its downside. ""It can be more difficult to get meetings because people don’t recognize the name, and you have to spend time explaining why you decided to make the change,"" said Don Steinbrugge, head of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money.
Name changes don’t come cheap, either. Rebranding companies generally charge anywhere from $40,000 to $400,000, according to industry participants.
The firm, which has raised money in the past several years issuing lower-fee collateralized debt obligations, recently hired Louisa Church as head of investor relations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Its flagship hedge fund has climbed 11% through July.
The new name, Sculptor, goes into effect on Sept. 12.

The new website’s database has more than 50,000 beaches in 178 countries and territories in its database.
An aerial view of the shoreline in Venice Beach, Calif.
In terms of summer hot takes, the question “What is a sandwich?” may get peripatetic foodies up in arms. (In case you were wondering,  burgers and hot dogs are most definitely not.) An equally valid query might be: What defines a beach?
Does it have to be on an ocean? Is a sandy shore on a lake a beach? What about a peaceful river bank?
For Sand.ee, a new site dedicated to cataloguing and rating every beach in the world, the answer is: all of the above. Its goal is to help users find the right beach—no matter their definition of the word. Its growing database includes more than 50,000 beaches in 178 countries and territories around the world, says founder Randall Kaplan.  
Kaplan, a serial entrepreneur who also co-founded Akamai Technologies Inc. and is the chief executive officer of venture capital firm Jump Investors, says he got the idea for Sandee about six years ago in Mykonos while trying to find a black sand beach. In an attempt to help, his hotel concierge took out a paper map and circled an unidentified place with a black Sharpie, sending Kaplan out in a chaotic pursuit through backroads with no cell service. They eventually found a pristine, private beach after hours of searching. 
“I thought there just has to be a better way,” he says. “There was no definitive source where people could find information on every beach in the world.” 
Several million dollars of his own money later, with the help of consultants—some 75,000 man hours, Kaplan estimates—and surveys of more than 10,000 people, Sandee LLC was born. The company plans to raise its first round of outside capital later this year. A Kickstarter campaign (with promotional video) in late 2016 raised $35,008 from 57 backers, followed by an additional $33,285 in related donations, says Kaplan.
Right now, the website is in a “soft-launch” stage and is seeking additional photos and recommendations from users. Although the site is comparable to TripAdvisor and Yelp, which both also list user-submitted reviews/content on beaches, Kaplan emphasizes that what sets it apart is its specific focus. 
“We love those websites,” Kaplan says. “But they’re not known as beach websites. We’re doing one thing and one thing only: beaches.”
Elizabeth Monahan, communications manager for TripAdvisor, offers that the site does feature an annual list of travelers’ favorite beaches around the world, based on the quality and quantity of traveler review and ratings over the previous 12 months, but she declined to comment specifically on Sandee. Yelp also declined to comment for this article.
Anybody can search for a beach by name or location from the homepage, although users who want to sift beaches by their amenities or post photos or reviews must create an account and log in to use the “Explore” feature. Early tests raise some functionality questions. For instance, a beach that doesn’t have a photo in the database might appear as a result, but users can’t click into its entry; users with accounts can search for the nearest beach, but they can’t search or sort for sand quality. 
Moreover, the geo-locating isn’t always accurate: a search for “New York City” or “New York, NY” returns nothing, but a search for “Rockaway Peninsula, Queens” returns Rockaway Beach, a stretch of sand within the city limits and accessible by subway; the first search should return what the latter did. Further searches for “Fort Tilden” or “Jacob Riis,” two separate, supremely popular city beaches next door offer very different scenes/vibes—potentially a perfect use case for Sandee’s database—yet neither are surfaced. 
Stephen Leatherman aka Dr. Beach, a coastal scientist and professor at Florida International University who early on met with Kaplan to discuss a partnership, cautions about the site’s lack of data on safety: “I can’t recommend a beach without noting the safety.” His own 50-point list includes water cleanliness, wind speed, smell, and wildlife. (Kaplan says Sandee does currently feature information about shark attacks, jellyfish, rip currents, and riptides, although not in a prominent or searchable fashion.)
Strauss Zelnick, founder of private equity firm Zelnick Media Capital and a friend of Kaplan, is more sanguine. He says Sandee fits in well with the trend of travelers wanting to do extensive planning before a trip. “We don’t do much of anything without researching it online first,” he says. “The consumer likes to be educated.”
Kaplan says that in 98% of the cases, it’s clearly defined where a beach begins and ends. “In circumstances where it’s hard to tell, we would rather err on the side of including vs. not including.”
Once identified, beach entries are given written descriptions and essential details such as whether it’s public or private, the current weather, contact info, hours, and the color, size, and texture of the sand. There is also sortable checklist of 94 data points that catalog amenities (e.g., lifeguards, dogs, fire pits, party scene, showers, Wi-Fi), activities (e.g., bike paths, fishing, ATV, jet skiing), chair or umbrella rentals, food, transport options, and accessibility.
To find cover photos for all of its beaches, in addition to user submissions, the Sandee team has been soliciting photographers to get free rights with credit. “Many take amazing beach photos that are sitting on a laptop—people would rather see their work online somewhere,” says Kaplan, noting that one photographer has contributed more than 1,800 drone photos.
Sandee’s revenue model includes sponsorship deals with the website, which it will seek from hotel chains, airlines, and beach brands, as well as advertising opportunities for individual beaches. The site also plans to license its property data and photos to destination marking organization and local tour operators. Kaplan is planning to start work on an app in three to four months.

For $2,500 a month, users can book vacations through the Inspirato Pass without nightly rates or fees.
What does luxury travel now have in common with grocery shopping, music streaming, and shaving?
The subscription model.
In mid-July, Denver-based travel club Inspirato launched its Inspirato Pass, which allows customers to book unlimited stays in luxury vacation homes, as well as legacy five-star hotel brands such as Ritz Carlton, starting at $2,500 a month with no other nightly rates or fees.
The subscription e-commerce market has exploded in the past decade, generating more than $2.6 billion in sales in 2016, according to a 2018 report by McKinsey & Co. About 15% of online shoppers have signed up for one or more monthly subscriptions.
But though such subscription service companies as Netflix, Blue Apron, and Dollar Shave Club are widely known, this model has yet to become commonly used in the travel industry. There have been such entrances into the market as that of FinalPrice, which launched in 2017 to offer hotel, flight, and rental car deals for $99 a month, and Flightpass, a pass valid for 10 flights that Lufthansa Innovation Hub tested out in 2017. There are also many membership options in the private jet arena.
But the Inspirato Pass marks the first time the upscale leisure travel industry has tried out the model.
Inspirato founder and Chief Executive Officer Brent Handler came up with the idea as a way to solve a common luxury travel problem—unbooked inventory, especially in the high season. He saw this phenomenon plenty in the normal business of his company, which uses long-term leases to manage $1 billion in homes and hotel rooms. Inspirato’s goal is to create a complete and comfortable vacation experience for families or groups of friends, usually in houses. 
“I knew that was happening with Inspirato,” he says “It’s not just low season in a resort or hotel, where inventory spoils”—or goes unused, in other words. “When inventory spoils, let’s say, in a ski area in February, it’s even more costly.” 
In Inspirato’s traditional model, members—currently 15,000—pay a $20,000 entrance fee to join and then $3,600 each year, not counting the cost of a specific trip. The membership allows them access to stays at properties Inspirato handles. Rates run from $300 to $8,000 a night, depending on the property.
But with the travel pass, you pay a flat monthly fee to book stays at three types of inventory: more than 350 Inspirato homes, rooms in five-star hotel brands, and Inspirato-only experiences such as cruises and safaris, all updated daily.
For $2,500 a month, customers can make a fresh reservation as quickly as one week after they have checked out of a prior reservation. An additional $500 a month allows you to share the pass with friends or family when you’re not traveling.
But say you want to plan ahead and make multiple vacation plans for the year. For $5,000 a month you can have two active reservations at a time, and for $7,500 a month you can have three. (To share these passes with friends or family requires an additional $1,000 a month and $1,500 a month, respectively.)
“For instance, a lot of New Yorkers would buy or rent a place in South Florida,” Handler says. “You can still go to South Florida with the Inspirato Pass, but you can also go to Paris. You’re not locked in or tied in to a single place.”
The Inspirato properties available for pass holders to book vary, based on an internal algorithm that determines which places are going to lose Inspirato the most money if they remain unbooked.
Where it gets interesting is Inspirato’s ability to give pass holders access to five-star hotel brands such as Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental. Inspirato has developed relationships with more than 200 hotels to offer their unbooked inventory to pass holders—as long as it doesn’t show the discounted price. 
“What all luxury hospital providers also share is a disdain for consumer discounting,” Handler says. “You will never see a Four Seasons sell a room for half off.”
The Inspirato model allows luxury hotels to prevent rooms from sitting vacant without revealing how much of a discount they’re giving—which could cheapen the brand.
“We’re buying inventory from the hotel, and we’re paying for it, and the consumer is never seeing the price,” Handler explains.
Inspirato has direct relationships with about 90% of the hotels it lists, he says, but is allowed access to about 10% indirectly, through tech partners. Handler declines to disclose the exact details of the tech partnerships. A representative for Ritz Carlton said the brand does not have a relationship with Inspirato, although rooms at its hotels are listed on Inspirato’s website. 
Nicholas Farina, general manager at 1 Hotel Central Park, says his hotel worked with Inspirato and then agreed to be part of the pass program. “They have a loyal membership base, and we’re able to have access to those guests,” he says.
Although he would not reveal the discounted rates for his hotel’s rooms on the Inspirato website, he noted that 1 Hotel lists its higher-end rooms, as well as its unbooked inventory.
For Michael Shaw Jr., a 45-year-old car dealer in Denver, buying an Inspirato Pass was a natural extension of his regular Inspirato membership, which he’s had for five years. Handler says that about half of Inspirato’s members have also bought into the Inspirato Pass.
Since he got the pass in June through Inspirato’s test program in the Denver area, Shaw has already been to Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Park City, Utah, along with a jaunt to the British Virgin Islands, where just he and his wife stayed in a 9,000-square-foot home.
“That’s the beauty of the pass; it wasn’t going to change the economics of it for us,” he says of the generous space.
Unlike, say, Hulu or Birchbox subscriptions that you can cancel after a month, Inspirato pass customers make an initial six-month commitment to stick with the payments, after which they have an opportunity to cancel every month.
Tien Tzuo, CEO of Zuora, which provides software for companies to launch and manage subscription businesses, says the subscription model is successful because it’s a good deal for consumers and exposes them to new things—in this case, new travel locations. Inspirato is using Zuroa’s software to manage its pass program. 
“It’s not just about how I can save on that nightly rate,” Tzuo says. “My whole experience different now. I can try out new cities and experiences.” 
But Devy Schonfeld, a business professor at Pasadena City College who has studied the subscription economy, questions whether there will be consistent consumer demand for the pass.
“Luxury travel purchases can be ‘chunky’ in that time is a restricting factor, and even if people travel luxuriously, the ability to take enough trips to maximize value will be a gating factor,” he wrote in an email. 
Another risk for Inspirato is that pass holders will take full advantage of the travel opportunities. “The subscription economy works because they’re betting on people not using it that much,” says Rafat Ali, CEO and founder of travel intelligence platform Skift. “If the utilization is very high, that will affect their margins.” Still, Ali expects the travel industry to increasingly adopt the subscription model as a way to generate customer loyalty. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other luxury hospitality companies like Four Seasons could potentially look into something like this as well,” he says.

A French man has successfully crossed the English Channel on a fly board, 10 days after his first attempt failed.
Franky Zapata, 40, left Sangatte on the Northern coast of France at 8:17 a.m. local time on Sunday and landed 22 minutes later at St Margaret’s Bay in Kent, England. The Marseillais crossed the 35 kilometers (22 miles) thanks to a tiny flying board propelled by five mini turbo-jet engines.
“We didn’t give up,” a tearful Zapata said during a press conference in Bleriot-Plage after the crossing. “The harder the job is, the more beautiful the victory is. Nobody in the team will forget this moment.”
Zapata traveled at a speed of about 160-to-170 kilometers an hour during most of the crossing, he said. His first attempt 10 days ago failed after his board hit a platform of the refueling boat.
Zapata is a former world and European jet ski champion. Last month, the inventor took part in the Bastille Day celebrations and showcased his invention by soaring in the Parisian skies as President Emmanuel Macron looked on.
The 26.1-kilogram board Zapata designed to cross the Channel is “100% French,” and has a maximum tested speed of 202 kilometers an hour, the inventor said, adding that he had no plans to commercialize it yet. Its “twin brother” called the “Easy Fly,” which has attracted the attention of armed forces worldwide, costs an estimated 250,000 euros ($277,700), he said.
Zapata received sponsorship help from Zenith Watches and Acer Computer International for the challenge, he said.
Success in life “doesn’t necessarily mean to succeed financially.” Zapata said. “What matters is to realize one’s dreams.”

In a week when just a few words from Jerome Powell and Donald Trump were enough to send stocks reeling, it’s easy to conclude their pronouncements are all that matter to markets right now. But something else keeps showing it can sway prices: bad earnings.
While investors clearly were glued to every word from the central bank and president, the reporting season showed that fundamentals still matter, particularly in a market as richly valued as this one. Falling short of earnings forecasts has led to swift consequences.
Among S&P 500 companies that have reported second-quarter results, those whose trailed analyst estimates saw their stock lagging behind the market by 3 percentage points the day after, data compiled by Goldman Sachs showed. Meanwhile, beats were rewarded by gains of 1.43 percentage points. The spread, more than 4 points, was the third biggest since 2012.
The divergence in performance shows that even in an environment where macro concerns seem to dominate, getting stock selection right still has consequences. Earnings haven’t lost their ability to move markets -- something else to worry about as companies slash their forecasts at the fastest rate in four years.
“Investors are worried, they’re anxious, they’re looking for reasons to sell,” Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank, said by phone. “Earnings expectations have been lowered. When you miss those lowered expectations, you’re going to get punished.”

End of dialog window.It’s a message that is easily lost if all you do is stare at the market’s surface. Broadly, stocks have been chained to every turn in monetary and trade policy. The S&P 500 tumbled after Fed Chairman Powell called Wednesday’s interest-rate cut a “mid-cycle adjustment,” denting hopes for a full-blown easing cycle. They dropped again after Donald Trump said he’ll impose new tariffs on Chinese goods and just posted the worst week of the year.
Amid all the noise, it would be easy to brush aside the importance of earnings. But equity reactions to individual announcements show the market is becoming less forgiving at the company level.
Even after last week’s drop, the S&P 500 is up 17% this year despite no profit growth to speak of, while valuations have expanded at the fastest pace in a decade. At 16.7 times forecast earnings, the index was trading at an 11% premium to its 10-year average.
Some of the optimism is linked to expectations companies will ratchet up growth to almost 6% in the fourth quarter and then 10% for the whole year of 2020, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
The expected rate of acceleration is too optimistic, according to strategists at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Both firms predict an increase of no more than 6% for next year.
Trump’s planned 10% tariffs on additional $300 billion of Chinese goods would trim the S&P 500’s profit growth by 60 to 70 basis points as input costs rise and corporate confidence weakens, according to an estimate from Bank of America.
Companies are lowering their guidance. Among those that have provided forecasts for the third quarter, more than half were below analyst estimates, the worst since 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
The combination of elevated valuations and deteriorating earnings can be trouble for stocks, according to Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which has about $253 billion under management.
“There are stocks that have gotten over their skis,” he said. “When that air pocket faces reality, you get a pullback.”

The Federal Reserve has the stock market’s back, right? That’s what a lot of investors have come to believe. The so-called “Yellen put” (after former Fed Chair Janet Yellen) has rolled over into the “Powell put” (after current Fed Chair Jerome Powell) in trader parlance that likens central bank policy to options contracts protecting against losses in equities.
But what if the Powell put doesn’t do the trick this time, and economic data and corporate earnings continue to deteriorate despite interest rate cuts? What if it isn’t enough to counteract U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war?
That’s one of the topics the “What Goes Up” podcast delves into this week with Alec Young, managing director for global markets research at FTSE Russell.“Things like housing will respond very favorably to lower rates—a lot of the traditional economic metrics will,” Young says. “But a lack of [capital expenditure] due to trade-related anxiety? CEO, CFO confidence? I’m not sure that’s the kind of metric that’s as sensitive to a modest reduction in the Fed funds rate. So, given how much markets have run on the back of one positive catalyst, there’s quite a bit to lose if the market has maybe overshot its skis a little bit.”Also joining co-hosts Mike Regan and Sarah Ponczek is Romaine Bostick, a reporter and anchor on Bloomberg Television, to give his take on the state of play in markets, and what he’s hearing from sources on Wall Street.

Still, elevated bacteria levels continue through a majority of the lake, the Department of Environmental Protection said in a press release.
On June 27, DEP officials confirmed the presence of a harmful algal bloom in the lake after receiving reports of people experiencing mild skin rashes after coming in contact with the water. Fertilizer runoff can cause algal blooms. The agency advised the public to avoid swimming, wading, jet skiing, kayaking, wind-surfing and paddle-boarding.
The situation led state lawmakers representing the Hopatcong area to urge Governor Phil Murphy’s administration to work faster to reopen the lake.
Indian Harbor, which is adjacent to Henderson Cove, had the advisory lifted on July 26.
“Bacteria levels do remain high in the majority of the lake,” DEP Commissioner Catherine McCabe said in a statement. “Swimming and active watersports should be limited to Indian Harbor and Henderson Cove.”

In search of raw authenticity on an adventure cruise to West Papua, Indonesia.
Felix Wom, chief of the Asmat village of Syuru, looked intimidating in his grass skirt and fur headdress, bird feathers protruding from the side. A necklace of sharp animal teeth stretched across his bare, muscular chest, and his nose held a large curled ring. This ornament was made of seashell, but in the past it could have been carved from human bone.
Twelve miles off the sparsely populated south coast of the Indonesian province of West Papua, Wom sat, unsmiling, for the first time on the deck of a cruise ship. The 120-passenger Coral Adventurer was on an  inaugural voyage to West Papua, which encompasses most of western New Guinea and other nearby islands, and the ship’s captain had invited Wom and a handful of other village elders onboard to calm any fears about intruding foreigners. He offered them a look around, hats with baseball logos, and tins of butter cookies to take home.
“They want to have a peek at us and really want to see the ship,” says tour lecturer Kathryn Robinson, a retired anthropology professor at Australian National University whose research focus includes Indonesia. “If you say no, because that would make us feel uncomfortable, that doesn’t work. … Hospitality is a big thing in Indonesia.”
The chief already understood it—the symbiotic relationship between locals and visitors. “We can keep our culture because people come to see it,” he said through a translator, acknowledging the importance of the money the cruise line brings to his village. “We would be very happy to have more ships coming.” As I walked away from our chat, the chief raised his chin, looked ahead at nothing, and let out a long rhythmic call.
The Asmat people once were known as great warriors who used headhunting and cannibalism in their warfare, cultural rituals that ended for good about 60 years ago with the arrival of the Indonesian government. Photographer and art collector Michael Rockefeller, one of Nelson’s five sons, may have been a victim of cannibalism after his boat overturned near an Asmat village in November 1961, according to the book Savage Harvest, by Carl Hoffman. His body was never found.
The culture lives on in part through performance—which is how the government likes it, says Stuart Kirsch, a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan who specializes in the Pacific region. “When you’re not there, they’re wearing Rolling Stones T-shirts from the global used-clothing market, cutoff jeans, and worn-out flip-flops,” Kirsch says. West Papua has an independence movement, he says, but “that’s typically scripted out of the tourist narrative.”
Add the navigational difficulties of swirling winds, shallow seas, shifting sands, and multiple reefs, and it’s no wonder travelers seldom stop by. That our diesel-electric vessel was here, near the equator in the middle of hot nowhere, is a result of the expanding market for expedition cruises. Such small-ship travel has drawn particular interest among baby boomers willing to pay fares that often top $1,000 a night for meaningful soft adventure experiences in hard-to-reach destinations.
In this growing niche of the cruise market, 39 expedition ships are set to make their debut from now to 2024, according to Cruise Industry News. Big cruise companies are dipping their toes into the lucrative arena. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. acquired four expedition ships (as well as five ultraluxury ships) last year when it paid about $1 billion for a two-thirds stake in Silversea Cruises Ltd. “It probably increased their fleet capacity by 2% but increased their profit flow by 6%. The profit per ship is that much higher,” says Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Brian Egger.
Most of the new boats are polar-class vessels bound for popular cold places such as  Antarctica,  Iceland,  Greenland, and the Canadian High Arctic. But other cruises are sticking to the tropics. As a result, some of the most isolated people on Earth are seeing more visitors.
Wom’s village of Syuru, with its rustic houses and boardwalks crossing the swamp, will welcome four shiploads of cruisers this year, a number agreed upon by the government and tribal representatives. Timing is important in the expedition business: The May itinerary of our round-trip cruise from Darwin, Australia, was tweaked so we could beat a ship owned by French line Ponant SA by a day.
We arrived early in the morning after two sea days churning north from Darwin. Passengers boarded the ship’s two hop-on, hop-off tenders and passed mangroves along a brackish river on our way to the village. As we approached, dugout canoes from several clans emerged from shore. Athletic men and young boys paddled from a standing position, most in grass skirts, their faces and bodies covered with war paint, which assures the warriors their ancestors will protect them.
Men reached for the sides of our boats. Paddles thumped against wood in unison with war cries. “They are performing themselves as violent people,” Robinson said. “They are saying, ‘This is who we are.’ ” If they were trying to look scary, they succeeded with me, especially as the flotilla increased to dozens of canoes.
Onshore, men performed a traditional ceremony to launch a new canoe. It was a frenzy of hip-swinging dancing, raised spears and shields, chanting, yelping, and drumming. Women in grass skirts, some topless, danced in support. Passengers stood on the edge of the ceremony, the action only somewhat diluted by some of the villagers holding cellphones. They were taking pictures of us, as we were of them. And what a sight we were in our “adventure” wear, sun hats, and sunglasses, slathered in sunscreen and bug spray. I hadn’t thought of myself as a cultural attraction, but locking eyes with a half-naked elderly woman, I realized we both were probing another world. I felt out of place in this one.
Cruisers pulled out rupiah to purchase Asmat art, which is sought by museums and collectors around the world. (Rockefeller was seeking pieces for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s collection of primitive works when he disappeared.) The art traditionally tells the stories of ancestors, but when I picked up a figurine for about $15—some works went for quite a bit more—and asked about its symbolism, the shy artist said it was just something he imagined.
Oswald Huma, a tour agent from the island of Savu, west of Timor, was hired by Coral Expeditions, based in Cairns, Australia, to help map out our “Warriors and Wildlife” itinerary. He said the most common question the villagers ask is, “Why do these people come to see us?” He struggles with the answer, usually replying that travelers want to buy the wood carvings. He doesn’t want to mention the attraction of a history of headhunting.
Robinson says the interactions bring much-needed income. She’s noticed that, since she first visited the Asmat a few years ago, conditions seem to have improved. “The way I see it, for these people who are miles away from any of the circuits of capital, tourism is helping them to realize that they do have something the world will buy, which is their culture,” she says. “We might have anxieties about it. But all through Indonesia, people hope that tourism is going to bring income into these remote areas. These people are separate from the exigencies of the world. Pristine and untouched has also got its negatives.”

The visits also provide the Asmat an opportunity to practice their culture, Huma says. Elders traditionally teach youth the group’s customs by performing ceremonies; paying customers are an excuse to do so. Kids also see the outside world and have an opportunity to practice English, “so they can go out and seek employment and send money home,” he says.
“It’s like anywhere where people are performing their culture,” says Kirsch, the Michigan professor. “It can be uncomfortable, but it can also promote mutual recognition. The Asmat are well known for their art, and these encounters can stimulate appreciation for the artistic style.”
Agats, a larger town we visited nearby, has imported goods for sale to locals. Among them are rice, which isn’t a staple of the Asmat diet but has become popular, as well as electric motorbikes, tea, sugar, and cellphones. Given the spotty signal, the phones are mostly used as cameras and for playing music.
Huma had spent months in his boat on the Arafura Sea south of West Papua, sometimes in rough seas, convincing leaders in remote villages to welcome the Coral Adventurer. He also arranged for English speakers to meet us at each of four stops. Many are teachers, and some traveled far for the jobs as guides.
In the village of Sangliat Dol, on Yamdena Island in the province of Maluku, the push and pull of multiculture life was magnified. During a one-hour bus ride beforehand, our guide said, “Visitors are rare, as it destroys the daily life.”
We were met by an enthusiastic crowd of costumed women in embroidered white peasant blouses and sarongs. Some had arrived hours earlier from nearby villages to greet us with a dance in which they waved scarves and small towels. They welcomed us as “sons and daughters of the village.”
A smiling older woman grabbed my arm, and to the accompaniment of drums and singing, the crowd danced past tin-roofed homes to a megalithic ceremonial stone boat in the village center. Shouting, shoving, even screaming ensued, and cruise passengers were hustled off to the side.
Seating in the boat is based on status, but it can be contested. A man had taken a position someone else felt was his. Government officials moved the arguing men out of view so a smaller group could perform a planned ceremony honoring our ship “elders.”
The fight—with yelling and shoving—was the rawest experience of our cruise. But for the locals, there was a price to be paid. A government official threatened to file a report, saying there would be consequences. Our ship withheld bags of school supplies, soccer balls, and clean sheets and towels for the health clinic, similar to gifts we’d delivered to other villages. The donations to Sangliat Dol returned with us. “We don’t know when we left the village if they would fight over a soccer ball,” Huma said. “We don’t want a bad thing to happen.”
No one on The Coral Adventurer, not even the captain, had sailed the West Papua itinerary before, a route designed to mimic a portion of Dutch explorer Abel Tasman’s voyage roughly 375 years ago. Coral Expeditions, a 35-year-old company owned since 2014 by Kallang Capital Holdings Pte. of Singapore, is known more for its cruises of Australia’s Kimberley region and the Great Barrier Reef.
When you commit to an expedition cruise to a remote locale, you can expect long days at sea getting there. Wi-Fi connections are sporadic, and there’s no satellite TV. Lectures are the main shipboard activity. A marine biologist prepared us for the world’s largest fish, whale sharks—who apparently didn’t get the memo about our arrival. We looked for them without success in Triton Bay in the southwest corner of West Papua. The passengers, mostly Australians over 60, relaxed onboard in modern cabins and lounge areas accented with African wood and Italian marble. Hot water flowed from showers, cappuccinos from coffee machines. Dinner was a three-course affair, with Australian wines.
It was sticky and hot when we explored the tidy dirt streets of the Muslim village of Arguni (population 227), in the Fakfak regional district. Women, their heads covered, and their grandchildren offered warm but cautious smiles. Most of the village’s adults were as far away as Bali and Jakarta for work or study. Although it was Ramadan, women had risen early to prepare fish dishes and cakes made of tapioca.
“You are not tourists anymore, but part of our family,” King Hanafi Paus Paus told the crowd. Later, in his small house, where the front room is furnished with plastic patio chairs and the walls are decorated with photographs of his forbears, the king said tourism is improving. Another ship had arrived five months ago. Ships have a “good effect,” he said through a translator. “It protects the history, plus we get money. People leave for work, and now work comes to us.” The king’s two sons are in high school in the town of Fakfak about 30 miles away. He goes there in his boat, then uses a car he keeps in town to get around.
In all the villages, locals attempted a few words of English, and there was a warmth and sincerity to our encounters—even if most amounted to us staring at them and them staring at us.
Ngilngof village, on Kai Kecil Island, provided the welcome that felt most linked with the outside world: Women in bright purple jackets and long gold skirts danced with delicate hand movements as a ritual leader in black raised a coconut, invoking ancestral protection for the island’s natural resources. Meanwhile, on a 3-mile-long beach with soft, white sand, plastic chairs were set up under a tent you could rent for the afternoon. Snack bars sold cold beers and Diet Cokes.

Traders face an onslaught of information about the state of the U.S. economy this week. Nevertheless, they’re likely to take their cues directly from the Federal Reserve, since data have proven a poor guide to the path of policy.
Economic reports aren’t dragging the central bank to the interest-rate cut that’s widely anticipated on Wednesday. Numbers due next week are expected to show an uptick in the Fed’s favorite measure of underlying inflation and unemployment staying close to a half-century low.
It’s small wonder, therefore, that the prospect of the U.S. central bank’s first easing in more than a decade has stirred trepidation among traders, since it’s unclear what happens next. While markets have been priced for lower interest rates for much of the year, traders have struggled to read the Fed’s signals.
In contrast to June, trading volume last week was even more tepid than it usually is in the middle of the U.S. summer, and traders -- suffering from low conviction -- have been stepping out of the fray even while their dovish bets look set to be rewarded.
“It’s extremely unlikely that any of the data is really going to change the narrative very much ether way,” said Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies LLC.
On the likelihood of another cut beyond July, he said, “we don’t think that it’s necessarily appropriate, but we’ve moved away from thinking about what the Fed should do and trying to now just look at what the Fed is going to do.”
The market is indicating that the central bank will deliver at least a 25-basis-point cut on Wednesday. But the Fed can meet that expectation and still come off as hawkish, sending yields higher. Traders will want their “ounce of prevention” -- as Chairman Jerome Powell has described a modest easing -- with a dovish chaser, such as an assurance that more cuts will come if needed.
Some observers also expect the Fed central bank to stop shrinking its balance sheet this month rather than waiting until September, as previously announced. While this move wouldn’t have much immediate impact on the broader market, it would end an element of policy tightening might appear on the surface to be incongruous with rate cuts.

The main risk to current positioning is the possibility of a 50-basis-point reduction. That’s kept traders across the front end of the curve on edge and extremely sensitive to recent Fed speeches and press reports.
Futures and options volumes in the eurodollar market dropped below recent averages over the past few days, with one player pocketing gains on a bullish wager early last week to lighten risk over the July decision. But bets on bold action from the Fed were still trickling in, with a fresh trade midweek targeting a half-point easing by September.
The exception to last week’s subdued trading was a flurry of activity on Thursday, which saw selling of bonds on both sides of the Atlantic after the European Central Bank sounded less alarmed about the economic outlook than some had expected. That helped lift Treasury yields, with the two-year rate ending last week at 1.85% and the 10-year at 2.07%.
U.S. central bankers won’t have missed the message from this episode: that market expectations are high and easily disappointed. Bets on easing in the second half of 2019 have come off a little last week, but fed funds futures are still priced for the policy rate to fall 66 basis points this year.
For his part, Simons reckons the Fed could be headed for another modest cut in September, but “the market is over its skis a little bit on expectations for central banks globally at this point.”

CannTrust Holdings Inc. shares climbed after the board of the Canadian cannabis company fired its chief executive officer and forced out its chairman amid a scandal over a regulatory breach.
CEO Peter Aceto was fired “with cause” and chairman Eric Paul resigned at the request of the board, Vaughan, Ontario-based CannTrust said in a statement Thursday.
CannTrust jumped 16% to $2.27 at 9:32 a.m. in New York on Friday. But the future of the company remains uncertain with sales on hold amid a government investigation and lawsuits piling up. The shares are down 54% this year.
“This stock has been absolutely pummeled,” Brian Madden, senior portfolio manager at Goodried Investment Counsel, said on BNN Bloomberg TV. “As to the existential question, can the company continue to operate? Frankly I don’t know. You are granted the public trust of growing a regulated product, then you violate it, not accidentally but flagrantly; I don’t know if Health Canada lets them keep their growing license.”
Aceto, who was previously CEO of Tangerine Bank, and Paul, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
The shakeup comes after a Globe and Mail report cited internal correspondence showing that the executives were aware pot was being grown in unlicensed rooms about seven months before Health Canada, the federal regulator, unearthed the breach.
A special committee appointed to investigate the claims had “uncovered new information“ that led to the termination of Aceto, who had joined CannTrust after a career in the banking world in October. Robert Marcovitch, who chaired that committee and previously headed ski and snowboard maker K2 Sports, was appointed interim CEO.
CannTrust said it has voluntarily disclosed its findings to Health Canada and will “fully cooperate” with the regulator in order to resolve the matter expeditiously. The impact on its financial results is unknown at this time, according to the statement.
On July 8 the company said that the federal regulator gave a non-compliant rating to its greenhouse in Pelham, Ontario, forcing it to halt sales of nearly 30,000 pounds of pot. The company was found to have grown the crop in five unlicensed rooms between October and March, and employees were found to have provided inaccurate information to the regulator.
Several law firms have either filed or are investigating lawsuits against the company.
Derek Dley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc., said it’s likely the company’s license will be suspended and it’s unlikely the company will be taken over by a competitor. He cut his price target on the stock to C$2.50 from C$5.00 while maintaining a hold rating.
“While we believe CannTrust’s physical assets may still be of value to other Canadian licensed producers, we do not anticipate the company being acquired in the near term given the uncertainty surrounding the penalty expected to be levied by Health Canada,” he said in a note dated Thursday.

Comcast said Thursday that it added 209,000 internet subscribers in the quarter, trailing the year-earlier pace. The company also shed 224,000 pay-TV customers.
Investors are paying close attention to Comcast’s internet business, which has become the main driver of growth as consumers drop their TV subscriptions in favor of online entertainment.
Internet customers are an especially profitable line of business for Comcast, because the Philadelphia-based cable giant doesn’t have to share a chunk of revenue with channel owners. The company has also been raising internet prices.
Shares fell as much as 2.4% in New York trading before recovering. They were up 0.6% at 11:11 a.m.
Comcast’s internet subscriber growth was higher than analysts’ projections for a gain of 204,000. The company added 260,000 internet customers a year earlier.
At 224,000, the loss of pay-TV customers was worse than projected and 60% more than a year ago. On Wednesday, AT&T Inc., another pay-TV provider, reported record video-subscriber losses, but its shares went up. It’s sign of investors’ increasing comfort with the idea that cord-cutting isn’t an existential threat to telecom companies.
Comcast reported profit of 78 cents a share, excluding some items. That was up from 69 cents a year earlier and topped analysts’ estimates of 75 cents. Revenue was little changed at $26.9 billion, missing Wall Street projections.
Sales at Comcast’s NBCUniversal, which includes the NBC broadcast channel, cable channels like USA, and the Universal film studio, totaled $8.2 billion in the quarter, roughly flat from a year ago.
Revenue at Sky, a European pay-TV giant that Comcast bought last year, fell 3.3% on a pro forma basis. Sky’s advertising revenue dropped, partly due to economic uncertainty over Brexit in the U.K.

Boris Johnson is poised to become the U.K.’s next prime minister and British business is wasting no time in urging him to avoid crashing out of the European Union.
The former London mayor won the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party, clearing his path to assume the premiership on Wednesday. After his victory, Johnson reiterated his pledge to leave the EU by the end of October and “take advantage of all the opportunities it will bring in a new spirit of can-do.’’
“This idea of leave-what-may on October 31st is hugely worrying businesses because of the effect on investment and jobs,’’ Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. “We are deeply, deeply concerned about no-deal.”
Like his predecessor, he’ll enter No. 10 Downing St. with one urgent demand from U.K. Plc: resolve the years-long Brexit stalemate clouding their plans. Unlike Theresa May, who spent 18 months working out a deal that Parliament repeatedly rejected, Johnson will have three months to meet his pledge to quit the bloc by Halloween.
The 55-year-old Oxford graduate has been keen to win back industry support after it emerged that he had dismissed their Brexit concerns with the words “f*** business’’ as foreign secretary last year. He wooed CEOs at breakfasts in recent weeks, accompanied by supporters including Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss.
For now, putting Brexit aside, corporate Britain has been largely welcoming of Johnson, seeing positive signs in his pro-enterprise attitude when he was London mayor.
“We need that optimism and energy,” ITV Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall said on Bloomberg TV Wednesday. “He was very pro-business, he invested in infrastructure.”
Johnson has also hired pay-TV broadcaster Sky’s chief operating officer, Andrew Griffith, as his senior business adviser, giving him the job of improving the government’s relations with U.K. companies. Griffith will start Wednesday, according to an internal Sky memo seen by Bloomberg. In recent weeks, Johnson has used Griffith’s London townhouse as a base as he prepared to become prime minister.
In the past, Johnson’s positions have been malleable. He eventually -- albeit briefly -- supported the Brexit deal negotiated by May even after lambasting it. After leading the campaign to leave the EU, it emerged he had also written a draft article in support of remaining.
Johnson has pledged to restart Brexit talks with the EU, bringing “positive energy’’ and a “sense of mission’’ akin to the Apollo 11 moon landing to the negotiations. And he may need it, as his premiership will start in choppy waters.
Sterling fell to the lowest in more than two years against the dollar in recent weeks as Johnson solidified his position as the leading candidate to replace May, reviving worries over the potential for a no-deal Brexit.
Honda Motor Co. expressed concern that some of its suppliers aren’t doing enough to prepare for the possibility the U.K. will crash out of the trading bloc, after the threat didn’t materialize in March, a spokesman said. Ford Motor Co. is again getting ready for a no-deal exit by safe-guarding its supply chain and stockpiling parts, a spokesman for the U.S. carmaker said.
The auto industry stands to lose 50,000 pounds ($62,250) a minute should the country crash out of the EU, because friction at the border will leave plants starved of parts, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said recently.
U.K. businesses face a shortage of skilled workers, slowing productivity growth and infrastructure that’s in need of an upgrade, said Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors.
“A no deal Brexit would only add to the uncertainty and distract from these challenges,” Morgan said in a statement. “Avoiding a disorderly exit will enable the country to focus on them and move forward to everyone’s benefit.’’
Brexit aside, Johnson will face a raft of major policy decisions, such as whether to expand Heathrow Airport, and whether and how to restrict the use of gear from Huawei Technologies Co. in the nation’s fifth-generation networks. Johnson, who represents a west London constituency, had pledged to lie down in front of the bulldozers to prevent a third runway being built at Heathrow. He said last month he still had “grave reservations” about the expansion.
“Heathrow will be the cornerstone of any new government’s economic plan,’’ the airport’s CEO, John Holland-Kaye, said by phone. “If we are setting out to create better trading links with other parts of the world as an independent country then we need the long-haul flights from Heathrow to all those markets. Any future Prime Minister will support that.”
Meanwhile, the change in attitude at the top represented by Johnson is already causing some to cheer.
“It’s inspiring to have someone who’s optimistic and proud to be British,’’ said Jack Allen, the finance and production manager at Owen Barry Ltd. in Somerset, a maker of leather and sheepskin apparel and bags. “We’d be helped by a deal being in place and more confidence in the economy and just certainty all round.’’
Allen, who voted for Britain to leave the EU, has seen the company lose 190,000 pounds in sales from customers in Japan, about 10% of its revenue, due to concerns about Brexit-related disruption to deliveries. The weak pound has also pushed up the cost of the sheepskin Owen Barry imports from Spain and Turkey, shrinking its profit margins and forcing it to reduce staff hours.
“He needs to be single-minded in the negotiations, but there are lots of hurdles ahead,’’ Allen said.

The Royal Navy needs help, as the likely new prime minister is about to discover, to his chagrin.
Facing an Iran problem.
Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin may be the world masters of the tactic, but Boris Johnson also understands the appeal of diversionary foreign policy. He made a career out of picking fights with the European Union — winning validation in the 2016 Brexit referendum and, very likely, in soon becoming his party’s choice to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May.
Now, however, Johnson stands to inherit a foreign policy crisis that makes an already difficult job a lot harder.
Britain’s Royal Navy, once a maritime force to be reckoned with, was caught off guard on Friday as Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops in ski masks rappelled onto the decks of the Stena Impero, a U.K.-flagged tanker. The ship may even have been diverted off course by Russian “spoofing” — providing false GPS coordinates. It shouldn’t have been a surprise, as my colleague David Fickling notes: Iran all but gave the date and time of its retaliatory move after Britain, earlier this month, interdicted an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar, which the U.K. alleged was carrying oil to Syria in contravention of EU sanctions. Britain’s lack of preparation has dealt May’s successor an immediate foreign policy nightmare.
In dealing with the crisis, Johnson couldn’t ask for a worse set of cards. His Conservative Party has a razor-thin governing majority (depending on the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party) that may well disappear if there are enough defections over his hard-line Brexit stance. And, Brexit aside, lawmakers are already inclined to regard his statements with suspicion, given the series of gaffes he committed as foreign secretary — including one that likely worsened the plight of the British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been jailed in Iran.
Johnson has a friend in Donald Trump, but he should be under no illusions that the U.S. will grant him any favors without asking for something in return. The U.S. is already at loggerheads with the U.K. government over Iran policy — in part because Johnson, as foreign secretary, opposed Trump’s abandoning the Iran nuclear deal. It doesn’t help matters that diplomatic cables critical of Trump from the former ambassador to the U.S. were recently leaked. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made clear that responsibility “falls to the United Kingdom to take care of their ships.”
Normally in a crisis, Britain would depend heavily on the EU for political and material backup. But EU-U.K. relations are strained by Johnson’s determination to exit the EU on Oct. 31 “come what may” — a promise that weakens EU security and threatens to plunge Ireland, Britain’s neighbor and an EU member state, into a profound economic crisis.
You might think Brexit would have nothing to do with defense matters. May herself has clearly stated that Brexit would never get in the way of Britain’s close security partnership with Europe. And Brexiters often argue that the EU is too dependent on British intelligence and military power to weaken those ties.
But, as May has learned the hard way, non-members cannot plug into the EU’s security and defense policies in the same way member states can. The U.K. has already been kicked off the Galileo satellite program, the EU equivalent of the U.S. GPS navigation system. When U.K. Secretary of State Jeremy Hunt, Johnson’s opponent in the Conservative leadership race, proposes that Britain and the EU cooperate in monitoring the Strait of Hormuz, questions about the terms of such cooperation immediately arise.
Johnson may seek to somehow use the crisis to his advantage — but where is his leverage?
Brexit is being sold not merely as a way to escape EU regulations and control immigration, but also as a way to revive Britain’s global destiny, invoking an era when the Royal Navy ruled the waves.
But that picture is hardly recognizable at the moment. The Royal Navy is in a state of severe decline, in number of both vessels and personnel. Even if plans for new ships are realized, the total will remain fewer than what Britain had in 2013. The outgoing government is sending the destroyer HMS Duncan to the Persian Gulf, but only to relieve the HMS Montrose, a much older ship that’s due for repairs. Less than half of Britain’s 19 destroyers and frigates are operational.  
This weakness cannot be laid at Johnson’s door. He can even be expected to try to reverse it over time (though it was Hunt who argued during the campaign for more defense spending). Yet Johnson’s crash-out, no-deal Brexit would be the most costly of all Brexit options. To win support, he has promised handouts, including tax cuts for the relatively wealthy. It’s doubtful there will be money enough left to boost defense spending.
For all these reasons, the Iran crisis is the opposite of a useful foreign-policy diversion. It shows up every weakness that Johnson inherits, and highlights the new ones he brings to the job.

Photographer: Mark Coote/Bloomberg
New Zealand’s ban on foreign buyers is damping house prices in Queenstown, a stunning winter playground for the rich that has been a magnet for wealthy overseas investors.
Nestled on the shores of a pristine lake on New Zealand’s South Island, and ringed by majestic mountains, Queenstown’s popularity with buyers from Australia, Asia and the U.S. had seen values double in little more than three years. The boom has been brought to an end by a nationwide ban on foreign property buyers the government introduced in October in a bid to make housing more affordable for its own citizens.
“It’s very, very clear the foreign buyer ban has impacted the Queenstown market,” said Nick Goodall, Wellington-based head of research at Corelogic New Zealand. “It’s a massive chunk of demand taken out.”
Prices in the Queenstown region fell 0.1% in June from a year earlier -- the first annual decline since July 2011 -- and dropped 2.2% the past three months, according to Corelogic data. At its peak in 2017, Queenstown’s annual house-price inflation hit 32%. Government figures show the number of property transfers involving a foreign buyer fell to 2.7% in the first quarter from 9.7% a year earlier.
The median price was still NZ$1.17 million ($790,000) in June, maintaining Queenstown’s reign as the most expensive real estate market in the country.
The town’s allure isn’t hard to fathom. With two ski fields on its doorstep, and another two just up the road in fellow resort town Wanaka, it has become a winter playground for those who can afford it. Bungee jumping, thrilling high-speed jet-boat rides and mountain biking trails continue to attract tourists year-round, while a picturesque landscape dotted with vineyards completes the package.
New Zealand’s remoteness is also seen as a boon by some rich-listers, such as billionaire Peter Thiel, who have chosen Queenstown as a bolthole away from global turmoil.
The curb on foreign buyers comes at a time of increased supply. Queenstown is the busiest region for home construction, with new building consents about 8% of existing housing stock, according to Corelogic.
The ban on foreign speculators has also impacted on Auckland, the nation’s most populous city, where prices have dropped 2.7% over the past year. But it isn’t likely to suppress house prices at a national level amid a shortage of new building, continued immigration and record-low interest rates.
Kiwibank estimates New Zealand has a shortage of 130,000 houses, which may rise to 150,000 next year. The country of almost 5 million people is adding 50,000 new immigrants a year.
“With housing in such short supply, material house-price falls are unlikely from here,” said Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr. He expects national house-price inflation to accelerate from 2% in June to 3% this year and about 5% in 2020.
Still, the market remains mixed, with potentially further declines in Auckland and Queenstown but gains possible in provincial cities where homes are more affordable, he said.
“Queenstown and Auckland are international markets, in particular Queenstown,” Kerr said. “A lot of buying was pulled forward leading into the ban. Prices in Queenstown are now falling and it looks like that will get worse.”

Aspen Forum Goes Without in 2019,"Statues stand behind empty chairs in Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol.
Call it the Case of the Vanishing Trump Administration Officials.
That was the mystery that played out at the 2019 Aspen Security Forum, where senior officials, thought leaders and reporters gather annually in one of America’s wealthiest ski and sun playgrounds to debate timely matters of national security and foreign policy. The event was established a decade ago to bring Republicans and Democrats together for robust, bipartisan discussions.
But this year’s gathering was marked chiefly by the absence of any of President Donald Trump’s top officials. They either had scheduling conflicts or opted to stay away from an event that became synonymous a year ago with the contortions top officials must perform in defending Trump’s more unpredictable policies.
“We’ve got very senior people here -- and we’re very grateful to them for being here -- but there’s no question that we don’t have some of the cabinet level people here that have been here in past years,” said Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who now heads the Aspen Strategy Group, which took over running the event in January.
“I hope very much that we can assure the Trump administration next year that they can come and they can present their views and be heard,” Burns said.
The absence of administration officials begged the question of whether the U.S. is currently too polarized to even discuss national security, an area decision-making without adequate debate can have devastating consequences.
On the lush green lawns of the Aspen Meadows Resort, attendees even had a name for the phenomenon: the “Coats Factor.” That’s a reference to the moment a year ago when Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, was caught off guard when told Trump had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Washington.
“Say that again?” a visibly surprised Coats asked his interviewer. “O.K...That is going to be special.”
The Coats Factor isn’t just about Coats. Attendee Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of homeland security at the time, had to backtrack after she said Russia’s 2016 election interference efforts weren’t designed to favor one candidate or another. And FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were asked to account for the president’s actions, days after the Helsinki summit with Putin.
Perhaps as a result, invitations sent this year to Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and numerous other top administration officials went largely unaccepted, according to organizers.
Several officials accepted and then canceled at the last minute. They included acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, who stayed in Washington to testify Thursday to a House panel about the situation at the U.S. border.
The Trump administration has portrayed developments at the U.S.-Mexican border as a top national security threat, but the topic was barely raised at Aspen.
McAleenan may have wished he was enjoying Aspen’s cool conditions instead of facing heated questions from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, who grilled him about the treatment of migrants in U.S. detention facilities. “We’re doing our level best,” McAleenan told the lawmakers.
Some administration officials did attend, though. The most senior was Sigal Mandelker, the undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. She sparred civilly on Friday with Wendy Sherman, a former State Department undersecretary who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned. Amy Hess, executive assistant director of the FBI’s criminal, cyber response and services branch, also spoke on Saturday.
Among others in attendance included Philip Davidson, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and Robert Ashley, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. John Rood, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, also spoke on Saturday.
But there was, among participants, a distinct feeling of being let down. Officials may have stayed away out of fear for hurting their careers: Coats remains in his job, but has faced speculation for months that Trump wants him gone, in part because of his remarks a year ago.
The absences were also a reminder of how many officials occupy key posts in the Trump administration on an “acting” basis.
Some conservatives complained they were invited only to provide token opposition. Other potential invitees were told to stay away because administration officials felt the 2018 conference was too anti-Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified.
“There has long been an insular phenomenon in foreign policy circles where a few Washington types go to conferences to speak to a few more Washington types,” Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany said by email, describing a larger issue. “The latest trend is to shrink the circle even more by having Washington types discuss issues with just one side of the political aisle.”
While Trump and most of his team didn’t show up, the president was on everyone’s mind. As panelists discussed a resurgent Russia’s implications for European security, Trump continued to rage against four congresswomen of color. And as the sun rose in a cloudless sky on Friday in the Roaring Fork Valley, Trump unloaded on New York Times foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman -- who spoke at the forum as recently as 2018 -- whom he called “the Chin” and “a weak and pathetic sort of guy.”
The political leanings of the audience were clear. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright got a standing ovation when she declared that Trump is “dividing our country and dehumanizing those with whom he disagrees.”
And jokes about Robert Mueller’s Russia report were frequent, days before the former special counsel is scheduled to testify to lawmakers about his investigation.
“Why is the president unfailingly uncritical of Vladimir Putin and yet incessantly critical of the Democratic leaders?” Burns asked on a panel with former Acting Central Intelligence Agency director John McLaughlin.
“Well isn’t that the $64,000 question,” McLaughlin cracked. “And if I knew it, my name would probably be Robert Mueller.”
That theme reached its apex when Susan Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, appeared alongside NBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, who passed along Trump’s Putin invitation to Coats a year ago while the pair were on stage, eliciting the “that’s going to be special” response.
Rice had sharp words for the president, yet offered a succinct response when an audience member asked what should be done about the group that seemed very removed from Aspen this year -- the 63 million Americans who cast their vote for Trump in 2016.
“You respect them,” Rice said. “They’re fellow Americans who are entitled to their opinions.”

The year was 1999, and a flamboyant Italian man dined night after night at Matsuhisa, chef Nobu Matsuhisa’s ­eponymous Beverly Hills sushi joint. He’d heard the restaurant was lucky: Eat here before the Academy Awards, and you’re guaranteed to take home the prize. The man in question was Roberto Benigni, who, sure enough, nabbed the Oscar for best actor in Life Is Beautiful. The recipe for success had proved effective the year before, too, when Robin Williams snacked on its signature yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, then won the trophy for best supporting actor in Good Will Hunting. By then the establishment was swamped with A-listers.
One such star was Robert De Niro, who spent four years convincing Nobu that an enterprise in the actor’s native New York City would be lucky, too.
Fast-forward to now, and Bob and Nobu-san, as they’re called, have expanded their restaurant business into a  global lifestyle brand that includes  hotels and condos and forecasts revenue of  more than $1 billion in the next five years.
To understand the unflagging fervor for all things Nobu, I happily accepted an offer to maitre d’ at both New York locations: Nobu Fifty Seven in Midtown and Nobu Downtown in the Financial District. The position is usually reserved for a staffer who’s clocked well more than a decade with the company. From fetching deodorant for fragrant patrons to shuttling orders for black cod via private jet, here’s everything I learned.
During my 10-day stint, I recognized over 20 undisguised names on the reservations ­roster, including two Oscar-winning actors, an Emmy-winning showrunner, a Marvel Comics actress, several famous-for-being-famous socialites, a legendary singer-songwriter, a trending fashion designer, a Super Bowl winner, a rapper, and J-Lo and A-Rod on a date. “We fully appreciate that we’re a cafeteria for A-listers,” a manager says.
About 50% of VVIPs come with their own security. You can expect at least one table a night to be clandestinely filled with bodyguards acting like regular guests. The restaurant has security as an additional courtesy, though the in-house team is also there to back up the staff.
De Niro prefers the “sake table” in an alcove space at Nobu Downtown. But that beautiful shelf of vases around it isn’t a decorative accent—it’s a strategic barrier to create what the staff calls “visual privacy.” Curtains can be drawn to section off areas, and both New York restaurants have secret entrances for VVIPs—Nobu Fifty Seven has no fewer than three. If you spot a notable patron at a Nobu, it’s because they want you to see them.
Manager Amanda Stymeist spends 45 minutes before each dinner “dressing the room” at Nobu Downtown. First comes the offense: slotting movie stars into shaded corners where they won’t be gawked at, placing Wall Street guys at quiet positions to talk business. “Everyone wants one of our four booth tables—it’s like constructing a ­puzzle with 14 corner pieces,” says Johnny Hildreth, another Nobu Downtown manager. At both New York locations, the booths are the best see-and-be-seen options. “We even have subscriptions to People and Us Weekly to read up on the latest who’s who—and who shouldn’t be seated near whom,” Hildreth says. The hosts, a decade younger, are tapped to spot the YouTube stars.
When the doors open, the strategy switches to defense as all types arrive: bachelorette parties with obscene balloons, or guests with animals. Before a canine is let in, two questions are asked: “Is it a service animal?” and “What service does it provide?” Nobu doesn’t feed pups—but it once got a request to fill a Pomeranian’s bowl with Champagne. “I brought them the bowl and put the bottle of bubbly on the table,” Hildreth says. “That’s where I drew the line.”
Officially, Nobu doesn’t offer take-away—a decision made to safeguard quality—but there’s always an exception to the rule. The restaurants’ most common version of takeout arrives via personal plane. “We’ll do at least 20 orders a month and more during busier weeks like spring break,” says Anne Yamamoto, special events manager for the Nobus in New York and the mastermind behind the delivery of lunches and dinners to VIP clients as they shuttle around the globe.
For casual to-go dining at home, a slew of celebs have the restaurants’ managers on speed dial. One of the Ocean’s 8 gals has Stymeist’s cell number so the manager can troubleshoot a weekly take-away order from the nearest Nobu location. During my shift, from the oceans she ate: sashimi, sliced extra thin, and the standard yellowtail jalapeño and black cod—plus crispy rice, extra crispy, and two orders of beef tenderloin with a side of chopped onions and scallions, which was a pretty normal order for her. A different film and TV star obsessively orders takeout when she’s in New York. She placed two dinner orders during my short gig—it’s a good thing her traveling pants have an elastic waistband. Her yellow­tail jalapeño has to be sliced thin, with absolutely no red bloodlines showing.
Staff try to steer orders away from dishes that involve rice, because the combination with raw fish is fragile, but caviar requests are honored, including from an Avengers star who recently requested a buffet’s worth of after-dinner roe to go.
Surprisingly, celebrities don’t have access to a secret phone number: All bookings for the New York restaurants wind up with the centralized reservations team. VIPs are offered passwords to expedite bookings and to avoid fakers imitating them. Often it’s a first name and some numbers, but some codes—like “JuicyBooty” for a certain pop diva—are easier to remember.
With seatings, celebrities such as Drake, Martha Stewart, and the Kardashian coven are wild cards. They tend to book in the late afternoon on the day they dine to minimize the eyeballs on their reservation; it’s not uncommon for a pro athlete to request a last-­minute 15-seater after a basketball game, for instance. Once a famous recording artist with a reservation for 15 arrived with a party of 30 and stayed well past closing. All was forgiven when, at 1:30 a.m., he serenaded the staff. If a guest is rude on the phone, it’s usually one who isn’t famous, says a reservationist: “We brace ourselves for three to four ‘Do you know who I am?!’ conversations a day.”
Legends of A-listers unable to get a table fill the annals of Nobu—Tom Cruise was famously turned away; Madonna had to wait 30 minutes—and today you’ll still never get a 7:30 p.m. seating. Here’s why: The reservations team creates two service cycles a night, one at about 6 p.m., the other at about 8:30 p.m. It’s simple math. Parties of two tend to take two hours to dine, and for groups of three to six, add an additional 30 minutes. Larger tables take about three hours. Guests then are seated every 15 minutes from 5:45 p.m. to 6:15 p.m. and from 8:15 p.m. to 9 p.m., ensuring a steady flow of service for the 300 to 500 customers per evening. Generally the team overbooks the restaurant by about 10% each night to allow for no-shows and last-­minute cancellations. For non-VIPs, the best way to snag a table is to call the restaurant about 4 p.m. on the day before you want to dine—the sweet spot between last-minute cancellations and eleventh-hour bookings.
“The New York City clients are largely the best behaved,” says Jad Marouche, beverage manager at Nobu Fifty Seven and Nobu Downtown. The stories from his time at the Los Angeles branches (West Hollywood and Malibu) get the most eye-rolls from his colleagues, such as when a well-known movie director acted as if the cost of an extra $10 bottle of Fiji water was the end of the world. A few weeks later, Marouche heard the director say he’d installed a Fiji tap in his home that even piped the premium water through his shower. Another thorn in Marouche’s side was the Hollywood fixture so similar to the character he portrayed on a well-known sitcom that he always showed up drunk and slurry, yelling at waitresses as they passed.
Mistreatment of staff (touching or swearing at them) will get you permanently barred, a decision that comes all the way down from the owners. But Nobu is discreet; an evictee has to take it upon himself to make a ban newsworthy—like when billionaire Stewart Rahr threw a hissy fit to management in an email on which he copied everyone from Leonardo DiCaprio to Alicia Keys.
The U.S. Food and Drug Admin- istration strongly suggests all fish served raw should be frozen first, a practice that’s now law in New York City. Yes, you read that correctly: Almost every slice of sushi slung in the Big Apple has been freezer-treated, which means you’re never eating fish delivered that day. At Nobu, the soon-to-be sashimi goes into a medical-grade fridge that flash-freezes the product at -90C.
“We’re using the same freezer hospitals have to keep blood, so the fish cells don’t break down upon defrosting,” says Matt Hoyle, executive chef at both New York Nobus. Fish that will be cooked doesn’t need to be ­frozen. Generally, special items such as kisu (Japanese whiting) and tobiuo (flying fish) arrive at Nobu on Tuesdays or Wednesdays; ­premium cuts come on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
The reservations team estimates that more than 70% of the names in their database have at least one bulleted item appended, ranging from “tap water, no ice” to “always likes to talk to a manager.” A designer who lives in Tribeca allows no one to touch anything on her table—servers can place dishes, but water glasses must stay on the table when they’re refilled, and napkins may not be refolded.
Another regular, a supermodel from the ’80s, always brings in sugar-free ingredients and splashes around mixing the sauces. “I’ve thought of asking if she wants a chef’s apron,” says Hildreth. He’s even left Nobu to pick up deodorant for a businessman not-so-fresh off a London flight.
Chef Nobu’s legendary cuisine has changed America’s concept of Japanese food. Pioneering dishes, such as black cod with miso or yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, have been replicated at restaurants nationwide. At Nobu Fifty Seven, the black cod dish represented more than $1 million in sales in 2018. The yellowtail jalapeño did more than $1.5 million. Nobu’s Midtown hub isn’t even the empire’s most profitable location—that honor goes to the one in Malibu.
In New York the average person spends $120, not including tip; the number rises with large parties when sake magnums are toted out. A big spend is considered anything from $400 to $500; epic tabs come in at more than $1,000 a person. The omakase—a prix fixe sampler of some of the finest dishes—starts at $135. High rollers can set their own omakase price for premium eats, which ranges from $250 to $500 a head.
Extremely strict rules govern precise dish rollout. Even the tufts of lettuce are weighed before they’re incorporated into a salad (70 grams a plate). Separate line cooks man each station—salads, soups, tempura, sauté, grill, and pastry—supervising only a few recipes each.
Some diners attempt to get away with not paying for their meal. “Oh, we’ve definitely had people who’ve tried,” says a manager. There are other payment challenges: Once at the Miami location, a known cartel member threw a chair at a manager and threatened not to pay his $6,000-plus bar tab because the manager wouldn’t sing happy birthday to the kingpin’s girlfriend. The manager was able to talk him down. The cartel member eventually apologized and extricated a hefty wad of cash from his briefcase to pay.
There are, of course, exceptions in the other direction. The Downtown service team still talks about a gratuity left more than six months ago by a high-profile chief executive who was out dining with six friends, including an A-list actress and a model. He left an extra $22,000 on an $8,000 bill. Everyone working that evening reaped the ­benefits of his drunken generosity/miscalculation.

A supplier of drone technology to dozens of state and local law enforcement and public safety agencies, located in the U.S. and a handful of other countries, will stop working with Chinese drone manufacturers, citing security concerns.
Cape, a Redwood City, California-based startup, plans to inform customers Wednesday that it will stop selling software compatible with Chinese drones to its clients, most of whom use the tools to remotely dispatch and operate the small aerial vehicles to surveil possible incidents or crime scenes. It’s a blow to China’s DJI, the world’s top maker of drones that has spent years trying to calm fears that its products could be used for espionage.
The ban is the latest illustration of how technology companies are in the crossfire of the deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and China. American companies relying on global supply chains have seen their costs increase, while Chinese technology companies are increasingly viewed with suspicion in the U.S.
Michael Oldenburg, a spokesman for DJI, wrote in an email: “We are disappointed to learn about Cape’s decision, which is based on false speculation, and remain committed to continuously working with all of our customers—including more than 520 public safety agencies who trust our products to conduct critical missions.”
DJI’s situation has echoes of Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese telecommunications equipment company that the Trump administration has targeted as a national security threat for months, using these concerns to restrict its access to the U.S. market. DJI’s domination of U.S. drone sales has long raised its own suspicions. The U.S. Army expressed cybersecurity concerns with its drones in 2017, and Homeland Security issued an alert last month saying it was worried about sensitive video footage being sent to China.
“The statements from different federal agencies have caused partners and prospective customers to have concerns,” said Chris Rittler, Cape’s chief executive officer. “That’s real.”
But in blacklisting Chinese drones, Cape runs the risk of hampering its own business, at least in the short term. DJI currently accounts for every single drone that runs Cape’s software commercially. The company declined to specify how many that is, saying only that it has flown more than 150,000 trips.
Cape will begin asking new customers to choose from a list of approved manufacturers that, for now, has only one name on it: Skydio Inc. The startup is located a mile from Cape’s headquarters in Silicon Valley and recently began working with the Defense Department. Cape will allow existing clients to use their DJI drones until the end of their contracts, which last no longer than a year.
In a letter DJI sent to a Senate subcommittee last month, the company denied charges that it sends video footage abroad and said it has built custom drones without internet capabilities for use in government projects. It blamed criticism on a desire to squelch competition from China.
This month, the Interior Department published its analysis of DJI’s drones designed for government use. The agency recommended approving DJI’s products but suggested limiting their use to non-sensitive missions involving data that could safely be made public. One reason the department cited for approving DJI was the lack of any viable domestic alternatives.
Government officials and American investors have long pined for a competitive drone industry in the U.S., but China has established a stranglehold. “The market pressures have declared them the winner,” said Jim Williams, a former official at the Federal Aviation Administration who is now a consultant for clients using drones. “They’ve got the technology; they’ve got the low-cost manufacturing; and they continue to innovate. It’s going to be awhile before anyone can challenge them.”
Cape was founded in 2014 as a way for people to make rad skiing videos. It first edged toward law enforcement in 2017 while testing drones in Ensenada, a Mexican beach town about 70 miles south of Tijuana. Officers from the city’s police department caught wind of the tests and asked Cape to run a pilot program. So the company outfitted a single consumer-grade DJI drone with its software, which combines autonomous flying features with remote controls.
Police in Ensenada began using the drone to respond to emergency calls. Last summer, city officials said the drone had aided in more than 500 arrests and that the device had led to a 10% drop in crime. Public safety clients now make up about 70% of Cape’s business, according to the company. The remainder are oil and gas companies and public utilities; skiers are no longer a focus.
Rittler, the CEO, declined to identify which customers voiced concerns about Chinese equipment. Increased geopolitical conflict between the U.S. and China over the last several months, he said, wasn’t a major factor in the decision to break ties with DJI. “Tension has been underground, or behind the curtain,” said Rittler. “You’re hearing more and more of it come to the forefront.”

By 2010, they were married and Danny was settled into a job at Morgan Stanley. Their son Drew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia about 10 days before his third birthday.
“It took us about three days to decide to take him to St. Jude, and we never looked back,” Danny Birdsall said Saturday in Water Mill at the fifth annual Hope in the Hamptons benefit.
The Birdsalls moved to Memphis, Tennessee, for Drew’s 2 1/2 years of treatment at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, where Morgan Stanley let Danny work remotely. Six years later, they still call it home -- but the family hasn’t given up their summers on the South Fork.
Siblings Drew and Layla Birdsall
For the past five years, they’ve returned to Water Mill, where he’s the star of the St. Jude fundraiser with his younger sister, Layla, who was nine months old when Drew was diagnosed. The grandparents founded the event and contribute the horsey theme: David Birdsall is a blacksmith specializing in horse hoofs.

So there glowing in early evening sunlight as horse jumpers performed in an open field were Brett McGonegal, who left his investment-banking life in Hong Kong to raise his family on the East End, and Robert Zavell, an equities derivatives trader.

The event has become a favorite of Wall Streeters and plenty of other members of the community drawn to the Birdsalls’s story.
“About half of my parishioners are here,” said Rev. Sarah Bigwood of First Presbyterian Church in Southampton.
Drew, 9 years old and cancer free, started his summer in mud camp -- “It’s basically mud, you play in the mud,” he said -- and water skiing in Wisconsin.
In the Hamptons, he likes riding his grandfather’s tractor and going to the beach, because, as he noted with dismay, there are no beaches in Memphis, only swimming pools. It’s also muggier in Memphis.
Drew’s parents learned of St. Jude roughly a year before their son’s diagnosis, while attending a fundraiser in Chicago. They’ve embraced the opportunity to educate others about what makes the hospital special.
At St. Jude, “Your kid doesn’t realize what he’s going through,” Danny Birdsall said. “They will do everything possible to make sure your kid is comfortable, and walking in with a smile on his face, and really doesn’t realize the gravity of the situation.”
Shawna Birdsall added, “Kids are showing up with their IV tubes, with their masks on, and everyone else looks the same, so it becomes normal, and they feel like just a kid.”
Meanwhile, a few miles away, the Parrish Art Museum hosted its Midsummer Party honoring Maya Lin and Leonard and Louise Riggio.

Goldman Sachs M&A co-head Michael Carr and a director of the firm, Adebayo Ogunlesi, were seated for dinner (squash three ways, black cod, confetti cake) on the museum’s patio, along with artist Ross Bleckner and the directors of three museums: the Parrish’s Terrie Sultan, the Whitney’s Adam Weinberg and the New Museum’s Lisa Phillips.

Photographer: Stefania Curto for Bloomberg Businessweek
On Hut Run Hut, you’ll experience the wilderness and purity of Colorado in a way that no one else can.
We’ve been running for three and a half days now, passing through valleys aglow with yellow aspen groves. We’ve summited lung-busting peaks reaching almost 12,000 feet and hobbled among rocks beside slate-colored lakes. But suddenly my group, a small scrum of amateur endurance athletes, is presented with an unexpected challenge: How do we cross 30 feet of pavement?
That’s the question our guide Rickey Gates poses the only time we hit a road for the entire duration of the 100-mile Hut Run Hut in September. It’s a trek he leads every summer through Colorado’s Rocky Mountains, following a delicate network of trails that’s absolutely baffling in its beauty. Gates, who hides an impish sense of humor under his bushy mustache, asks us to cross the Top of the Rockies Byway by any manner other than running—because we’ve been running for days, and we’ll be running for days to come. “So, what’ll it be?” he asks. “How you gonna cross it?”
Many of us are middle-aged and graying, all of us old enough to know better than to undertake this journey. We can’t quite decide how to cross the two-lane road, which runs from Aspen to just past Minturn, Colo. Make like zombies dragging our damaged carcasses? Nope, already done by other Hut Run Hutters. Hmm. Well, beyond running on dirt for days, our group has spent a fair amount of time hopping from rock to rock across creeks. Not a single one of us has gotten wet. So we’ll hop.
You’d think traveling by foot through the Rockies for six days is a serious undertaking, even grueling. But Hut Run Hut is a joyous exercise, a way for distance runners of varying abilities to reap the rewards of logging all those training miles. A dozen or so participants run and hike from 10 to 20 miles a day, spending eight hours or more on single-track trails and remote dirt roads. And each night, they stay in one of the backcountry huts that dot the landscape throughout central Colorado. So, yes, Hut Run Hut is seriously difficult, possibly inflicting a real toll on the body. But Gates takes the view that such an endeavor should also be filled with glee.
This mindset comes from a lifetime of experience in these mountains: Born in Aspen, Gates began summiting fourteeners (mountains 14,000 feet or higher) in his teens and ran cross-country in high school. He’s gone on to make a career out of mountain running, gaining a sponsorship from French outdoor gear powerhouse Salomon SAS. Give him dirt and rock, big ascents and descents, and he’s home, placing on the podium in races ranging from 5 kilometers (Mount Marathon) to 125km (Canadian Death Race). But Gates, 38, has proved he’s not averse to pavement. In 2017 he linked together stretches of asphalt and trails in a transcontinental journey that took him from Charleston, S.C., to the Bay Area. And last November and December, he ran every street in San Francisco, documenting what he saw in its neighborhoods with camera in hand. Hut Run Hut began in the summer of 2014, loosely following a 100-mile winter tour normally traversed on skis. “I find that if people have made it as far as signing up for the trip, then they have overcome the biggest challenge,” says Gates. “That is: believing they are capable.”
Four days before our road crossing, we would-be Hut Run Hutters meet in the lobby of Aspen’s Limelight Hotel, where we drink beers, receive hydration packs to carry essential supplies, and contemplate turning back before it’s too late. Among us are Bob and Mary Kae Woodworth, a couple from Florida with kids who are full-grown—and probably wondering what in God’s name’s gotten into Mom and Dad. Then there are Bruce Chisholm and Richard Morbey, best friends from New Zealand who indicate they’re feeling good on the trail by saying they’re “a box of fluffy ducks.” There are doctors and lawyers and veterinary surgeons here—folks with full lives who desire to make them even fuller. “What’s your spirit animal?” Gates asks us, breaking the ice. Me? Hairless mole rat, I say—supposedly, they feel no pain.
The next morning we’re off on our trip beneath a perfect blue sky, leaving behind the luxury boutiques of Aspen. A few miles out of town on the trails, I’m already blowing hard, sweating, and, as we rise through the thin air, suffering a little. (Thanks for nothing, spirit animal.) Our group is just settling in for the long haul, and I’m concerned we’ve gone out too fast, jogging the uphills at about a 10-minute-mile pace. As far as full plates go, our first day will offer us a heaping helping: roughly 20 miles and 5,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain. The temperature is already approaching 80F, and it’s dry, the path turned to dust and the thistle shriveled to skeletons. Even in early September, some of the aspens above us have blushed to the color of peaches. In places where the foliage has already fallen, the ground seems covered with coins. My movements feel slow against the immensity of our surroundings, minuscule through this valley.
Our travel, though, isn’t always at this pace. Given the numerous grueling climbs, which reduce us to the grunt work of hiking, we’re sometimes rewarded with downhills unrolling for miles along magical paths wide enough for only a single runner—the equivalent of a surfer’s endless wave. Here the legs are freed, given gravity’s advantage, allowing the stride to open up. (Just watch those aging knees.) On our first day, our group descends a few thousand vertical feet along the trail at lunchtime to meet our support crew, who have set out a table with fixings for ham wraps and peanut butter sandwiches. We sit in the shade of a few trees against an otherwise open sky, a creek clamoring anxiously beside us. We down sodas and sports drinks, eat handfuls of chips and sticky candy. We rest. We stretch. We refill our bottles. And then we climb again. This first leg sets up a pattern for the balance of our week: climb, descend, eat, climb.
What awaits us on the other end of each day completes the pattern: repose. After the final ascent on our first afternoon, I get an initial glimpse of the steeply peaked roof of Margy’s Hut. It’s a bit dreamlike to find such a structure—a little house—stuck among all this wild, but the 10th Mountain Division Hut Association manages a constellation of more than 30 of these cabins in Colorado’s central Rockies. The association was co-founded in the early 1980s by Fritz Benedict, who’d been the head gardener at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin, the architect’s estate near Spring Green, Wis. Benedict first visited Aspen in 1941, then found himself a year later stationed at Camp Hale, drafted as a member of the Army’s 10th Mountain Division, which specialized in skiing and other winter maneuvers. Upon his return from Italy after the war, he became a prolific architect in Aspen, where he designed more than 200 buildings. Benedict’s other passion was skiing. Having traveled on skis between Camp Hale and Aspen as part of his military training, he and other veterans envisioned a hut system that would link Aspen, Leadville, and Vail. The first, McNamara Hut and Margy’s Hut, were completed in 1982.
Because sleeping arrangements are first come, first served, I’ve hustled the final mile to arrive here just before the rest of the group. But before I head upstairs to pick my bed, I’m halted on the first floor by its homey feel: There’s wood everywhere, a lumberjack’s fantasy. The hut has an open floor plan; the kitchen is spacious with plenty of counter space, and it flows into a dining area with two generous tables flanked by benches. Massive windows that reach to the ceiling overlook the deck. A wood-burning stove rests in the middle of the common area, which is outfitted with board games and books. There will be slight variations in each of the huts we’ll visit, but they are uniformly functional, right down to the basic but durable kitchenware. The similarities we’ll find while moving toward our destination of Red Cliff offer something reassuring: We get to pick up where we’ve left off in a book we’ve pulled from the shelves. (I’m so tired, it’ll take me several nights to finish The Lorax.)
Once our group has cleaned up and changed into flip-flops, fleeces, and jeans, we seat ourselves at the tables and listen to chef Dave Krutel describe the dinner that’s been trucked in by our crew. The fare is hearty and delicious, as it will be every night of our trip. On enormous communal platters, in bowls that require two hands to pass, we discover blackened swai fish with charred pineapple, mango and jicama salad, spiced black beans with fresh marjoram and orange, and pan-roasted sweet potatoes and peppers with garlic toum. I eat deeply, inhaling the food like air, going back for more. Room for dessert? Sure. Bring on the crisp plantains with coconut ice cream and rum raisins. And this meal is only the beginning of the food journey we’ll be taking alongside the one we’ll make on foot. Later in the week, we’ll feast on perfectly seared lamb chops and braised short ribs glazed with cabernet onion jam. And, yes, of course I’ll have the Nutella bread pudding.
Although the shared sleeping quarters are spacious and warm, most nights I choose to pull my thin foam mattress off its platform and out to the deck, where the silence is so clear it’s almost sharp. The temperature above 10,000 feet can plummet at night, so I mummify myself in my sleeping bag, watching the sky fill so completely with stars they seem cramped. First light washes them all away, then outlines a few nearby peaks, which seem to glow under thin stretches of clouds turned the color of pumpkins.
Our second-to-last day proves the most impressive. After we’ve dropped our bags at our support vehicles, we head out from Jackal Hut through evergreens until we hit a steady climb that takes us above the tree line. We’ll remain in the sun at these elevations all day and move among a low alpine growth, where we can see ridgelines, dozens of summits, and a twinkle of chairlifts on the open ski slopes of Vail. Here there often are no trails. We pick our way from peak to peak, sometimes over vast scatterings of rock. We’re often met with the meep, meep, meep! of pikas, gerbil-like creatures that scurry away from us toward crevices, a sprig sometimes clenched in their teeth as they ready their nests for winter.
Knowing the region so well, Gates has linked together an impressive network that lets us coast down dirt roads frequented by elk bowhunters and bushwhack in wilderness areas where the paths suddenly disappear before us. Most members of our group are subjected at some point to gravity’s grand drama—or comedy: We trip and fall, and we trip and fall greatly. Despite our numbers, I spend hours alone picking my way over rocks along the Colorado Trail or stopping to take in the next wonder. With so much time alone on the paths, one might think these stretches have been abandoned.
But such a notion goes against what’s been happening in America’s outdoors: More and more people are venturing beyond the scenic byways, stepping out of their comfortable cars, and hitting the trails. According to a 2017 report from the Outdoor Foundation, 42.1 million Americans over the age of 6, or 14% of the population, explored a trail the previous year. Running on roads and trails was the country’s most popular outdoor activity in 2016, with 52.3 million participants and 884.5 million outings. Also, ultrarunning—races longer than a marathon, a majority of which are held on trails—has seen a dramatic increase in participation. According to UltraRunning Magazine, there were 540 ultras in the U.S. and Canada in 2008. The number had almost quadrupled, to 2,014, by 2018.
Running for six days in Colorado can leave one believing its trails are simply limitless. Every dastardly climb seems forever balanced by a downhill, one that allows you to lope easily at top speed, to feel like you’re flying. Our group has such a descent on our final day. After running like kids through a sloppy creek bed, we hit a stretch of dirt road that gradually unwinds toward the town of Red Cliff. And then, suddenly, it’s there again—the pavement, an alien thing, stretched out for miles in front of us. We have no choice but to take it. So I close my eyes and imagine I’m crossing a creek, hopping from rock to rock, with endless strides of wild still ahead of me. Hut Run Hut is being offered Aug. 25-30 and Sept. 15-20. $2,500
It’s a big, beautiful world full of trails. Here are three other outfits that can send you on a dayslong run out in nature.
Trail Run AdventuresAnna Frost and Ron Braselton guide groups in Bhutan, Ecuador, Greenland, and other far-flung locations. There aren’t established hut systems for these trips, so participants stay overnight in hotels, high-mountain camps, and eco-lodges.
 Dolomite MountainsThis company books five- to nine-day tours through the peaks of northeastern Italy, with runners staying in a combination of hotels, B&Bs, and refugios (shared dorms).
Ultra CampsAnother option for getting off the pavement and out of the busy world is a trail-running camp. A handful of the U.S.’s elite ultrarunners, including Rob Krar, winner of both the Western States 100 and Leadville 100, offer the opportunity to gain a deeper knowledge of the sport while running alongside them.

Here's what you need to know to end your day.
The first Deutsche Bank casualty. Investment banking head Garth Ritchie will leave on July 31 and CEO Christian Sewing will take over the post. The announcement comes days before the chief is expected to present a sweeping overhaul after a board meeting set for Sunday. Up to 20,000 jobs are at risk in the cull, which will focus on deep cuts to the investment bank and leadership changes, people familiar said.
A plot is underway to stop a no-deal Brexit. Chancellor Philip Hammond is leading an informal group of 30 Tory MPs—including cabinet ministers David Lidington and David Gauke—and has held three meetings over the past month about how to prevent the U.K. from crashing out at the end of October, Sky News reported.
Alexis Tsipras's stint as Greece's prime minister may be about to end. His Syriza party is trailing in polls ahead of Sunday's election, with the center-right New Democracy party appearing the most likely winner. Tsipras shot to power during Greece's financial crisis with a message of hope, but for many of his compatriots, he was a sell-out who failed to deliver. The fact that Greece is back in investors' good books is of little consolation when you're scratching a living.
 Europe's slowdown is looking more serious. German factory orders slumped more than expected in May, just days after a survey showed factory activity shrank for a sixth month in June. That increases the prospect that the European Central Bank will add more monetary stimulus this month. And with almost all bund yields at or below zero, incoming ECB President Christine Lagarde told Germany it should lift public spending and cut taxes.
Amazon can't close its Deliveroo deal just yet. The U.K.'s competition watchdog is conducting an initial review into Amazon's bid to buy a slice of the food delivery startup, saying it has ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that the companies have either ceased to be separate businesses, or will merge in the near future. It's unusual for the regulator to examine acquisitions of minority stakes.
In a preemptive move, BMW CEO Harald Krueger told the board he won't seek a second term when his contract ends next year. The board will discuss his succession on July 18, with production head Oliver Zipse the front-runner to replace him, people familiar said. Krueger has faced growing criticism amid falling profits and an electrification plan that was seen as too tentative for a rapidly changing industry. His successor won't find things any easier, Bloomberg Opinion's Chris Bryant writes.
IAG isn't interested in Norwegian Air. The British Airways owner denied a Spanish report that it plans to make an approach worth about $1.2 billion after abandoning an effort to buy the discount rival in January. Separately, British Airways is entering mediated talks with pilots to avert a walkout over pay at the height of the summer travel season. It'll meet with the BALPA union on Monday. 
Bond yields everywhere are turning negative, and fund managers have little choice but to buy—against their better judgment, writes Marcus Ashworth for Bloomberg Opinion. In the process, an important law of financial logic has been broken, forcing investors who were waiting for yields to rise to get off the sidelines and try to catch up, and sharpish.
Samsung Electronics' numbers show just how bad the tech slump is, Tim Culpan writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Excluding a one-time gain from a U.S. customer, operating margins would be at a five-year low. If the gain came from Apple, it means the iPhone maker will have to wear a cost of as much as $850 million for a product it didn't even buy. And if Apple can't get it right, there's a high chance that others in the sector have miscalculated demand too.
In Businessweek, we look at the fight over the future of the British Virgin Islands, home to 400,00 companies with $1.5 trillion in assets, as locals try to fend off the global transparency movement. And why hedge funds are keeping their eyes trained on local airports in their hunt for the next megadeal. Then we examine the weird weather patterns that have led to great skiing conditions this summer in the U.S.
There will be wall-to-wall soccer on Sunday and not everyone is pleased. Just a few hours after the Netherlands play the U.S.in the Women's World Cup final, there will be two men's championship matches—Brazil vs. Peru for the Copa America and the U.S. vs. Mexico for the Concacaf Gold Cup. FIFA said playing three finals on the same day would boost attention for all, but American Megan Rapinoe wasn't having any of it. ""It's ridiculous, and disappointing, to be honest,"" she told the AP.Coal tycoon Christopher Cline, best known for reviving Illinois's mining industry and making a fortune doing it, died in a helicopter crash yesterday—a day shy of his 61st birthday. The accident off the coast of the Bahamas also killed six other people, according to an attorney who represented him. He was the founder of St. Louis, Missouri-based coal miner Foresight Energy.

Croatia may adopt the euro as early as January 2023, central bank Governor Boris Vujcic told the Vecernji List newspaper. Bulgaria and Romania are also seeking to introduce the currency, following other former communist countries Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have no immediate plans to join the bloc, despite being bound by EU law to eventually do so.

The December trip will follow a pad abort test for the Starliner on Nov. 4 at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, Boeing Vice President John Mulholland said Wednesday at a space conference. White Sands will also serve as the landing site when the Starliner returns from the space station.
The test flight marks a key step in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s commercial crew program, which calls for Boeing and Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. to transport astronauts. Since the space shuttle’s retirement in 2011, NASA has been forced to purchase seats aboard Russia’s Soyuz vehicles to ferry crews to and from the space station.
In the December test flight, the Starliner will fly aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and dock at the the station for several days. Boeing’s plan to accomplish its first demonstration mission earlier this year was delayed by technical issues and a busy government launch schedule at Cape Canaveral over the summer.
Boeing and SpaceX are also exploring ways to sell space flights to wealthy tourists and others to supplement their NASA passengers. In March, SpaceX launched its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station and docked for six days before returning to earth, splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine is visiting SpaceX on Thursday to discuss progress on the company’s work for the space agency.
On Sept. 27 -- the day before Musk introduced a new vehicle called Starship designed to go to the moon and Mars -- Bridenstine said on Twitter that NASA’s commercial crew program “is years behind schedule.” The agency expects to see “the same level of enthusiasm” for SpaceX’s taxpayer-funded projects as for the company’s other plans, Bridenstine said.
The NASA chief recently refuted Musk’s assertion that SpaceX would be ready to fly crews in three to four months. Bridenstine cited design changes to the Crew Dragon’s launch-abort system and remaining certification issues with the company’s parachutes.
“This is a discussion that we need to agree on between NASA and SpaceX,” Bridenstine said in an interview with The Atlantic published Oct. 1. “So I don’t want to preempt SpaceX and what their timeline is, but certainly ‘three to four months’ I don’t think is realistic.”
SpaceX has delivered more than 90% of the Crew Dragon systems that NASA must certify before a crewed flight, said Benjamin Reed, who manages commercial crew development for the company. He and Boeing’s Mulholland spoke on a panel at the International Symposium for Personal and Commercial Spaceflight in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule was destroyed in April when an explosion occurred during an engine test fire at Cape Canaveral. That mishap further delayed the company’s work.

It’s an appetizing story, and not just for the High Holidays.
A sampling from Acme Smoked Fish at company headquarters in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, New York.
Hot-smoked, cold-smoked, lemon-peppered, everything bagel-ed, kippered and candied. At Brooklyn, New York-based Acme Smoked Fish, smoking salmon is an art with dozens of permutations.
The wholesaler produced 15 million pounds of smoked fish last year, more than 9 million of which were salmon. Whitefish is also popular. Acme’s herring, which comes pickled, creamed and in wine sauce, is another fan-favorite. Sable, a smoked black cod known for its buttery texture and astronomical pricetag, is also among  the offerings. 
Every Friday morning, Acme opens its Greenpoint location to the public, selling its delicacies to anyone willing to make the trip. At 7:43 a.m. on a recent September morning, there were already 15 customers. Less than an hour later, the line had more than doubled, almost stretching to the street. Those waiting included mothers with young children, a visitor from Japan buying for himself and his touring theater company, an HBO production assistant and a collections manager from Brooklyn in his mid-60s. On particularly busy days—especially those surrounding Jewish High Holidays (Yom Kippur is this week)—the company says the line wraps around the block.
The joy of smoked fish has been spreading beyond New York’s Jewish population and its historic storefronts. Mile End opened in Brooklyn in 2010, followed by Shelsky’s in 2011. Wise Sons Jewish Delicatessen opened in San Francisco’s Mission District in 2012. Blue Circle Foods, a Washington-based seafood company founded in 2005, says smoked salmon is its best-selling packaged product.
Acme supplies such area stalwarts as Russ & Daughters, Barney Greengrass and Zabar’s & Co., as well as major retailers like Costco, Target and Wegmans. Since company founder Harry Brownstein, a Russian immigrant, began distributing smoked fish from a horse-drawn wagon in 1906, Acme has grown to become the largest American smokehouse, with operations in Florida, North Carolina and Chile, in addition to its Brooklyn headquarters. 
The cuisine known as “appetizing,” which includes smoked fish, cream cheese, capers, and all the other accoutrement one might put on a bagel, traces its roots to New York’s turn-of-the-century Jewish immigrants, who arrived en masse from Eastern Europe. Some 2 million to 2 ½  million Jews moved to the U.S. from 1880 to 1924, when the Johnson-Reed Act enacted significant immigration limits, and most settled in New York, said Annie Polland, executive director of the American Jewish Historical Society.
“Herring was the food of survival,” she said. “It was not a delicacy.”
The business has changed with the times. The industry is now global, rather than local.
The U.S. imported almost 100 million pounds of cured fish in 2017, according to data from the National Fisheries Institute, a seafood trade group. The rise of commercial aquaculture in the 1980s allowed Acme to replace a mostly wild supply with a largely farmed supply, driving down prices. Machinery was incorporated to slice and package the salmon, making products more widely available and convenient for consumers. Case shipments of smoked fish from food service distributors to restaurants—including independents, small chains, and, of course, bagel shops—were up 4% for the year ending in August, reaching $46.3 million, according to market research group NPD. While the quantities have multiplied, the processes, whether brining in saltwater, dry curing in salt or smoking in ovens, remain largely the same. 
The changes moved smoked fish from a specialty product to a mass item. Acme has seen 9% annual growth over the past 20 years and the company’s three brands—Acme, Blue Hill Bay and Ruby Bay—are sold in thousands of stores across the country.
The few remaining appetizing shops in New York are still largely family businesses, retaining their traditions as new generations modernize operations and expand their reach. That business is still growing, as well. 
At Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side, Niki Russ Federman and her cousin, Josh Russ Tupper, are fourth generation co-owners of the 105-year-old business. They took over in 2009, and the store count now also includes two restaurant cafes in Manhattan and a massive bakery and storefront in the Brooklyn Navy Yards. After an “intergenerational battle” over the website, the pair grew total sales by 330% from 2009 to 2018. 
Unlike Acme and Russ & Daughters, Barney Greengrass on the Upper West Side hasn’t expanded since 1938, when it added its restaurant section. “We’re in the same four walls,” said second-generation owner Gary Greengrass, but “pushing the walls as far as they can go.” The store retains its unpretentious charm: Refrigerators are stocked with fresh horseradish, and shelves are lined with Kedem grape juice. The customer base has expanded, but the regulars keep coming back.
“As I get older, people that were little kids—now they’re parents themselves,” he said. His son, Moe, takes time off from the eighth grade to help get customers their orders for Yom Kippur, the store’s busiest day of the year.  
Like all delicious things in America, smoked fish is no longer the domain of any single ethnic group. The Jewish High Holiday season, including Rosh Hashanah, the New Year, and Yom Kippur, aren’t necessarily the biggest sales events of the year for Acme or Russ & Daughters. Christmas is as big, if not bigger, said Richard Schiff, vice president of Northeast sales for Acme. 
“The food got co-opted in the best way,” Russ Federman said. “The same way we all eat pizza, everyone eats bagels and lox.”

The House Intelligence Committee heard Friday from intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who has said he examined a whistle-blower’s complaint about President Donald Trump and Ukraine and found it to be “urgent” and “credible.”
Here are the latest developments:
A second person is considering whether to come forward as a whistle-blower in the investigation of Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, the New York Times reported on Friday night.
The second person, like the whistle-blower whose complaint touched off the House impeachment inquiry, is an intelligence official, the Times said, but has more direct knowledge of what transpired leading up to the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The Times report, which cited two unnamed sources, said the second person had spoken to Atkinson.
House impeachment investigators on Friday subpoenaed the White House for documents on efforts by President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukraine, an escalation in the battle between Democrats and the White House over records and testimony.
Much of the information sought relates to alleged attempts by Trump and Giuliani, as well as others in the administration, to prod Ukraine into launching an investigation to help discredit Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
”We deeply regret that President Trump has put us -- and the nation -- in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena,” the chairmen of three committees wrote.
GOP Senator Ron Johnson says Trump denied to him in August that he linked security aid for Ukraine to Trump’s effort to prod that country into conducting an investigation about the 2016 U.S. election.
Johnson told the Wall Street Journal that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told him that aid was being tied to Trump’s wish for an investigation by Ukraine.
Johnson said he asked Trump about the matter and the president said he would “never do that.”
Chairmen of three House committees asked Vice President Mike Pence Friday to provide documents for the Trump-Ukraine investigation.
The chairmen said in a letter that public reports have “have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president’s stark message to the Ukrainian president.“
The chairmen are seeking, by Oct. 15, any documents Pence has related to his Sept. 1 meeting with Ukraine’s president during which the vice president was reported to have discussed the hold on U.S. security aid to that country.
The committee leaders also requested any documents Pence may have reviewed after Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, because of reports that a member of Pence’s staff may have participated in the call.
Pence’s office said in a statement that the letter “does not appear to be a serious request” and that it has been forwarded to his counsel’s office for a response.
Former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker sought to distance himself from any attempt to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, telling three House committees that he “at no time” was aware of or took part in such an effort.
Volker delivered the statement in his prepared remarks, obtained by Bloomberg News, to a closed door session with the panels on Thursday.
Volker said he didn’t act as a facilitator for Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in setting up meetings or other activities designed to leverage pressure on Ukraine officials for a probe of Biden and his son.
“Notably, I did not listen in on the July 25, 2019, phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskiy, and received only superficial readouts about that conversation afterwards,” he said in the remarks. “I was not aware that Vice President Biden’s name was mentioned, or a request was made to investigate him, until the transcript of this call was released on September 25, 2019.”
He also said he’s known Biden for 24 years and suggestions that he would act as vice president in any manner to benefit his son “simply has no credibility to me.”
Republican Senator Mitt Romney strongly criticized Trump for calling on China and Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.
“By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,” Romney wrote on Twitter Friday.
The Utah senator is one of only a few GOP lawmakers to publicly chastise the president.
Romney also wrote on Twitter, “When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.”
In late September, Romney said he was “deeply troubled” after reading a rough transcript of Trump’s July 25 call that showed the president asking Ukraine’s president to investigate Biden. -- Steven T. Dennis
Republican Senator John Cornyn alleged on Twitter Friday that the Justice Department is reviewing possible conflicts of interest by former Vice President Joe Biden, but a person with knowledge of the matter said the probe that Cornyn referred to doesn’t involve Biden.
Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees and a close Trump ally, said in a tweet Friday that the top law enforcement agency “is investigating foreign government influence, VP Biden conflicts of interest, and possible corruption.” He refused to give any details.
A Cornyn aide clarified that the senator’s tweet saying that the DOJ was investigating the Bidens was actually referring to a possible future expansion of an investigation led by John Durham, a U.S. attorney assigned by Attorney General William Barr to review the origins of the 2016 Justice Department and intelligence agency investigation of Russia’s influence in the 2016 election.
The person with knowledge of the matter said Durham’s investigation doesn’t involve the Bidens.
Trump has denounced the 2016 investigation as a “witch hunt” aimed at hurting him politically. He and his allies have been attempting to raise suspicions about actions by Biden, one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. Trump has publicly sought help from Ukraine and China to investigate Biden, and alleged efforts to do that behind the scenes are now the center of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. -- Steven T. Dennis, Chris Strohm
Trump insisted that he asked Ukraine’s government to re-open investigations into Joe Biden and his family only out of an interest in fighting corruption.
“We want to find out what happened with 2016,” Trump told reporters on Friday as he departed the White House to visit wounded soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “I don’t care about Biden’s campaign, but I do care about corruption.
“I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden,” he added.
Trump’s allegation that Joe Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukraine to abandon an investigation related to a company that employed his son Hunter Biden has been discredited. Trump has also asked Ukraine’s current government to explore an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that people in the country were behind hacks of Democratic Party email accounts during the 2016 election. -- Josh Wingrove
Intelligence Inspector General Michael Atkinson arrived on Capitol Hill to face questions from House investigators regarding a whistle-blower’s complaint about President Donald Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president that is at the center of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.
Intelligence Committee members and staff intend to ask Atkinson about the administration’s initial handling of the whistle-blower’s information. They’ll also ask for corroborating information he found that led him to deem the complaint not only credible, but urgent.
Atkinson first received the complaint Aug. 12, and he determined the report to be credible on Aug. 26 after his initial investigation. House Republicans have raised questions about the origins of the whistle-blower’s report and its credibility. --Billy House
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked in a tweet Friday morning what President Donald Trump promised China “in exchange for interfering in our election?”
“An easier deal on trade? Ignoring crackdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement? Condoning repression of religious freedom?”
Pelosi said in a separate tweet, “Congress must not back down from our duty to defend the Constitution as @realDonaldTrump ignores the Founders’ warnings about foreign interference at every turn.” -- Kasia Klimasinska
At least one Republican senator is worried about Trump’s invitation to China to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a written statement to the Omaha World-Herald, saying it’s up to the justice system to investigate the Bidens, not Beijing.
Ben Sasse
“Hold up: Americans don’t look to Chinese commies for the truth,” Sasse said, according to the newspaper, in one of the strongest rebukes to Trump from a Republican yet. “If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.”
Sasse nonetheless joined Trump in criticizing Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the House’s impeachment investigation. “Congressman Schiff is running a partisan clown show in the House -- that’s his right because the Constitution doesn’t prohibit clown shows, but fortunately, in the Senate, we’re working to follow the facts one step at a time,” Sasse said in his statement.
Speaking to reporters publicly on Thursday, Trump publicly declared some of the things that prompted the whistle-blower complaint in the first place. He called on both Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens as House committees began impeachment inquiries into whether Trump abused his power to get foreign governments to investigate a political rival.
The president defended his comments in a Friday tweet, saying asking other countries to help probe corruption “is done all the time.” -- Josh Wingrove

He’s still investing in transformation.
Ben Rosen, 86, helped pioneer venture capital. He’s still investing in transformation.
Ben Rosen
Ben Rosen has had several careers—technology analyst, early venture capitalist, entrepreneur—any one of which would have made him notable. A New Orleans native educated at the California Institute of Technology, Stanford, and Columbia Business School, Rosen introduced Steve Jobs to Morgan Stanley and financed Compaq Computer, Lotus Software, and Electronic Arts. With his older brother, Harold, Rosen co-founded in 1992 a hybrid car engine company that employed J.B. Straubel—long before Straubel helped start Tesla Inc. In an interview at his home in Kent, Conn., Rosen, 86, looks back over his pathbreaking career and describes what excites him today. Here are some highlights.
MARTY SCHENKER: You were there at the crossroads of some historic developments.
BEN ROSEN: The timing was fortunate. I just happened to cross paths with some people who were really important in our lives. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were 22 years old. And then Gordon Moore. He was my teaching assistant—when I was a freshman at Caltech, he was a first-year graduate student. So I’ve known him since 1950, and we stayed in touch. Later, Compaq was Intel’s No. 1 customer. The inventor of the spreadsheet, Dan Bricklin, and his associate Bob Frankston, I knew. They showed it to me in the beginning. And Mitch Kapor, who took it to the next step. Bob Noyce and Jack Kilby, who invented the integrated circuit. Kilby got the Nobel. Bob didn’t get it—only because he was dead.
MS: And Morgan Stanley’s position as an underwriter of technology company initial public offerings [IPOs] started with your introductions.
BR: First was the Apple IPO [in 1980]. They’d done one [technology IPO] many years ago, decades earlier. I don’t even remember the name of it. They apparently lost their shirts on it. They were embarrassed. It violated their rules, which was to be the banker for the No. 1 or No. 2 major companies in the major industries. They took a chance on this company. It was a disaster, so they decided no more technology.
MS: But then you introduced Steve Jobs?
BR: To Bob Baldwin. And it was funny to watch them. This was at a small trade show at the Hilton a few blocks from Morgan Stanley. And Steve knew nothing about the financial world, and Bob [who led Morgan Stanley from 1973 to 1983] knew less about technology. And the two of them were each trying to sell themselves. Neither heard the other or understood what they were saying. But anyway, they [Morgan Stanley] became a big technology underwriter. I had just left Morgan Stanley, and I was a one-year consultant before I moved out altogether.
MS: You could have been an early investor in Apple?
BR: Mike Markkula, who is the original investor in Intel—he bought a third of the company in 1976, I believe, for $91,000—one might call it really good venture investing. I knew him when I was an analyst. I used to see him at Intel. And he met Steve at a home-brew computer club in 1975. We were good friends, and he offered me $1 million of Apple stock at the time. I thought that somehow this was a conflict, even though Apple was a private company. I was an analyst. I was never on the banking side.
MS: So do you follow technology now? What interests you?
BR: Well, there are a lot of things that interest me. But to what extent? I’m an optimist. I got the optimism from my brother. He was the inventor of the geostationary communications satellite. He would always see the glass half full.
With something like climate change, I don’t minimize the issues, but I think that the solutions are being minimized. And the way to do something is to fund science.
The only investment I’ve made in 20 years, I just made [in Energy Vault SA]. There’s a longtime friend who runs an incubator in Pasadena, a Caltech graduate named Bill Gross. He’s actually the inventor of something called paid search, and he had a company called GoTo.com that started before Google, and they created the system that allowed one to get paid for search online.
He has a new invention now with another person, attempting to solve the single problem that is most impeding renewable energy, and that is storage.
Nature does it by having a lake at a high altitude, and you can release the water when you need the energy to generate electricity, and when you have excess electricity you pump it up again. But all of the natural storage areas are taken. So Bill came up with the idea to emulate nature, but instead of using water to use concrete. So the [Energy Vault] system takes 35-ton concrete blocks, lots of them, in a solar field or a wind farm, and when they’re generating energy that’s not needed, they have a six-arm crane very high up that pulls these up. And when they need energy, the cranes let these things down and they generate electricity. I’m not interested in apps—they’re useful and all—but I like things that are grand, and this is grand.
MS: When you started in venture capital in technology, it was a relatively new field.
BR: This is ’81. You could count on your hand how many venture firms there were. So what we were [Sevin Rosen Funds, founded with L.J. Sevin] was a startup only, just green fields. We didn’t do, with very few exceptions, any secondary investments.
MS: What always fascinates me is the difference between the person and the idea. How do you weigh those in your investments? Is it the idea or is it the person that’s more important?
BR: You mean in making the decision? The answer is yes.
MS: [Laughs] So it’s both.
BR: In some cases it’s one. For instance, in Compaq. At our initial meeting with the three entrepreneurs in Houston, they presented us with a hard drive for the then-just-introduced IBM PC. They were all at the hard-drive division at TI [Texas Instruments]. This is what they knew, and this is what they wanted to do. And we didn’t think that was enough, for us anyway, to build a company with. We encouraged them to go back and come up with another idea because we liked them.
Then they had a sketch of a portable PC. That sold us, and we invested in them because it was something that nobody was really doing at the time. The other thing we did was subtler but more important, and that was to make the first fully compatible PC with IBM. We knew IBM would get the business market, and we had to make something that a buyer and a customer wouldn’t get fired for [having].
Some people—Trip Hawkins at Electronic Arts—he was at Apple before. We liked the guy, and he said he was going to become a game studio.
One of the big risks is falling in love with a product. Because products usually have a lifetime, and if you don’t have an organization that comes up with the next product and the next and the next, then it will be a short-lived investment.
MS: There are people who are raising questions about [Apple Inc. CEO] Tim Cook and what’s next after the iPhone.
BR: Why don’t you come up with another half-a-trillion-dollar product? What’s wrong with you? [Laughs]
MS: In terms of people, I’m also curious about your involvement in politics. You held the first fundraiser for Barack Obama, or among the first.
BR: Not the first. I don’t know who the others were, but yeah, we’d seen Barack Obama on television. This is before he declared in Springfield in February ’07.
We saw Mayor Pete [Buttigieg] on Charlie Rose a couple of years ago. He was just a mayor. And then we started hearing about him late last year. And so I wrote, “To the mayor of South Bend, South Bend, Indiana: I would like to invite you to a fundraiser.”
With both of them it was hard inviting people. The first time, because Hillary was inevitable. We had a different problem with Pete because we sent the invitations in February, and he was really not known. And then 10 days before our meeting was the [Buttigieg] CNN town meeting, and that was really a spike. So we got 85 people to come to our apartment [in Manhattan].
MS: Is there anything, looking back on your career, that you would love to have done differently?
BR: Well, let’s see. I made a huge investment in a company my brother and I started, to make a hybrid electric power train for hybrid cars. Rosen Motors. It was one of those things that was an artistic success and a commercial failure. The technology was incredible. Some of it lives today in other companies, but not the promise that we had for it.
Other things, well, if I got another chance, I’d go to a liberal arts school because I’m more interested now in the cultural world. I went to Stanford after Caltech, and I saw the difference, because it had a student body that was interested in everything.
MS: So if someone in business school was interested in an entrepreneurial career, what would you advise him or her to do?
BR: I’d advise them to go to work in a company that’s doing something that would provide requisite experience—organizationally, maybe technically—in what the real world is like. Even though I went to business school, I don’t think it’s as helpful as getting industrial experience. And when I see now who’s in venture capital firms, they’re replete with people who’ve been in the industry. The other thing you learn by going into the real world is the network you develop. The network I got, even though it wasn’t industrial, but just by starting a conference and by starting a newsletter, I knew everybody in the part of the technology world I was interested in. And it was invaluable.
MS: You want to change philanthropy now?
BR: We live near Lincoln Center, and when we go to the ballet, we go to David Koch hall, and when we go to the Philharmonic, we go to the David Geffen hall. But if a person could go to a ballet at the Balanchine hall or a concert at the Leonard Bernstein hall, it would have such a different impact. There are 60 buildings at Caltech that have names, but there’s no Richard Feynman physics building, there’s no Linus Pauling chemistry building. The largest single contribution that we’ve made has been to start a biotechnology center at Caltech, and it’s a big deal there. And the woman who runs it, Frances Arnold, won the Nobel this past year. So the Donna and Benjamin M. Rosen Bioengineering Center is going to be the Frances Arnold Bioengineering Center.

An all-day neighborhood joint in New York’s Greenwich Village was last night named the world’s best bar, beating competition from luxury lounges around the globe and knocking London off the top of The World’s 50 Best Bars rankings.
Dante, which is now owned by Australian friends, serves modern Italian food and a range of cocktails but is still known for its espressos and negronis. The original Caffe Dante first opened on Macdougal Street in 1915, which was then a largely Italian neighborhood. Dante placed ninth last year and has won numerous awards since the current owners took over in 2015. 
Second place went to the luxurious  Connaught Bar in London, followed by  Florería Atlántico in Buenos Aires. Fourth was NoMad, New York, followed by the American Bar, London. The Clumsies, Athens, was sixth; Attaboy, New York, seventh; Atlas, Singapore, eighth; the Old Man, Hong Kong, was ninth; and Licorería Limantour, Mexico City, rounded out the Top 10.
The U.K. leads the 2019 list with 10 bars, while the U.S. has seven: Six in New York and one in San Francisco. Last year’s winner, Dandelyan, closed after founder Ryan Chetiyawardana, AKA Mr. Lyan, created a new venue, Lyaness, in the same London space. Lyaness placed at No. 39 this year. The awards were announced in a party-style ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
The 50 Best is an annual ranking voted for by more than 500 drinks experts from around the world. It’s owned and organized by William Reed Business Media, the group behind the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards.

Netflix Inc. has struck a movie-making alliance with Silvio Berlusconi’s Italian broadcaster Mediaset SpA, in the U.S. streaming giant’s latest effort to clinch more European viewers. 
The companies will co-finance seven titles and Netflix will contribute most of the funding, according to people familiar with the matter. Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings will be in Rome next week for an event to announce the multi-year deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because the plans are not public.
Netflix is cranking up production of TV shows and films all over the world to give its content a local flavor and capture more non-U.S. viewers. The push has already involved co-productions with broadcasters from Japan to the U.K. and France. The importance of those efforts was underlined in July when Netflix reported a drop in U.S. subscribers and slower growth overseas, sending its shares tumbling.
While the tech giant is likely to bring Mediaset a global audience for the jointly-produced movies, the deal shows the shifting balance of power in the industry as national networks lose viewers to a growing array of U.S. streaming platforms.
Mediaset, led by the billionaire former prime minister’s son Pier Silvio Berlusconi, is trying to lead a counterattack and has called on other European broadcasters to join forces and achieve the scale they need to compete.
Mediaset shares were down 2.2% as of 3:03 p.m. in Milan. Netflix shares in New York fell 1.5%.
Italy Said to Investigate Netflix for Failing to File Tax Return
Netflix has produced more than 60 international series in 2019, more than double last year’s tally. Recent foreign-language hits include “La Casa De Papel,” a Spanish heist series, and German drama “The Dark.”
It’s reached more than 30% of available customers in European markets such as the U.K., Germany and Sweden, according to estimates, but has more room to grow in southern countries.
Representatives for Mediaset and Netflix declined to comment.

Netflix Inc. plans to grow its international subscriber base by creating shows that will resonate with local audiences. In Britain, this amounts to a new phase in the war for viewers.
The U.S. streaming giant is planning a major production drive in the U.K. to come up with local content that can help it win more subscribers. This threatens the market share of rivals like ITV Plc and the British Broadcasting Corp. by encroaching on their dominant role in regional productions. The pledge comes as the pair are preparing to launch their own ‘Best of British’ subscription-video-on-demand service, BritBox.
“We’re going to see a very large increase in how much content is produced here,” Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said at the British industry’s main annual gathering, the Royal Television Society’s media convention in Cambridge, England. “That presents a lot of opportunities and a lot of challenges in terms of capacity, training and development.”
Netflix has already spent about 400 million pounds ($501 million) on U.K. programming in 2019, Hastings said, and has set up a production hub at the historic Shepperton Studios. The company doesn’t intend to buy British production firms, instead planning to work with them on a case-by-case basis, Hastings said. Netflix’s top British shows to-date include ‘The Crown’ and ‘Sex Education’.
The extra U.K. investment by Netflix is also a threat to domestic rivals because it will further inflate production costs, which have been rising due to limited supplies of space, talent and technical crew.

On Wednesday, some of the 11 justices asked government lawyer James Eadie why the administration hadn’t submitted a signed witness statement as part of its case. Judge Brian Kerr also requested a written undertaking stating what the government would do should it lose the case.
Government lawyer James Eadie speaks at the Supreme Court.

After Eadie committed to delivering the letter, Supreme Court President Brenda Hale said “it will be entirely inappropriate if you don’t do it by the end of tomorrow.”
The three-day hearing ends Thursday, with the justices retiring to consider their verdict. The case not only threatens to undermine Johnson’s position as prime minister, but could also curtail the British executive’s longstanding power over when the legislature sits. Johnson could be forced to recall Parliament, giving opponents of a no-deal Brexit more room to try to thwart his “do or die” promise to leave the European Union with or without a divorce agreement on Oct. 31.
The Supreme Court’s judgment will be the final word on whether Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks just ahead of a deadline to find a Brexit deal is lawful. It’s the result of challenges brought by businesswoman Gina Miller and nearly 80 lawmakers in lower courts in London and Edinburgh respectively.
Cases challenging Parliament's suspension make their way to U.K.'s top court


A London court had ruled in Miller’s case that Johnson’s actions were political, and so not an area for court oversight. Meanwhile, a Scottish court had said that Johnson was trying to stymie Parliament and the suspension is unlawful. The Supreme Court is hearing an appeal to both cases.
The Supreme Court’s request for a commitment from the government comes because the judges are likely to only rule on the legality of Johnson’s action and won’t dictate what happens next.
“Whatever the government says to the court in a letter will have quite a high status in terms of tying the government’s hands,” said Murray Hunt, the director of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law and a legal adviser to Parliament. “It can’t mislead the court. The reason the court is concerned about that in this case is because the government appears to have been sowing some doubt about what it’s going to do if it loses the case.”
Eadie began Wednesday by arguing that suspending Parliament is a normal government action and that there is no legal basis for determining for how long this can be. He also said there was still plenty of time for lawmakers to challenge Johnson on his plan to leave to the European Union without a deal.
“There is time and it’s up to Parliament and the government to legislate what they consider necessary,” Eadie said. He challenged the authority of the court to rule, arguing that there was no legal basis.
Aidan O’Neill, representing almost 80 Scottish lawmakers who won their case against the government in Edinburgh, used florid language to question whether the judges could trust Johnson to abide by any ruling.
O’Neill invoked Shakespeare and U.K. history to highlight the importance of preserving the unity of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, something he said could be accomplished by a strong Supreme Court. He then said the government’s reason for suspending Parliament was to limit scrutiny while it changed the historic relationship with the EU.
“Listen to the angels of your better nature and rule this prorogation is unlawful, an abuse of power,” O’Neill said in his closing speech. “This government is showing itself unworthy of our trust. Enough is enough. That is what truth speaking to power sounds like.”
Jolyon Maugham, a lawyer who is supporting the Scottish case, lauded O’Neill’s oration.
“What Aidan sought to do today is drag the case out of the technocratic reeds and show the court what’s really at stake here,” Maugham said in an interview broadcast by the BBC. “I’m really glad he did that.”
On Thursday, the attorneys will make their final arguments along with former Prime Minister John Major, who has joined Miller’s case against prorogation.

Several Supreme Court justices turned on the lawyer for the government in the case over Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament, demanding a clearer explanation of what the prime minister would do if he lost the case.
Under pressure from judges, Richard Keen, a lawyer for the government, promised to file a written answer on how Johnson would abide by a decision against him. Justice Brian Kerr went further, pushing to discover if Johnson would recall lawmakers or attempt to suspend the legislature again.
“Can we take it that he wouldn’t prorogue Parliament again?” Kerr asked. Keen deferred to the prime minister, before agreeing to submit a written answer.
“I’m not in a position to comment on that,” Keen said. “That will have to be addressed by the decision maker.”
The questioning came soon after Keen took over the afternoon session of the most closely watched case in U.K. history. At the center of the appeal is whether the decision to suspend Parliament in the countdown to an Oct. 31 Brexit deadline is even a matter for the courts.
The three-day hearing is the final stage of a landmark case that not only threatens to undermine Johnson’s position as prime minister, but could also curtail the British executive’s longstanding power over when the legislature sits. Johnson could be forced to recall Parliament, giving opponents of a no-deal Brexit more room to try to thwart his “do or die” promise to leave the European Union with or without a divorce agreement on Oct. 31.
Supreme Court President Brenda Hale opened the proceedings by attempting to put some distance between the legal issues and the country’s deadlocked Parliament by reminding the room that the role of the judges is non-political and concerned solely with bringing sense to complex points of law.
“This is a serious and difficult question of law -- amply demonstrated by the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion to three senior judges in England,” she said. “The determination of this question will not determine when and how the United Kingdom will leave the European Union,” she continued.
Earlier Tuesday, David Pannick, a lawyer representing opponents of a so-called no-deal Brexit, argued that Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament was an abuse of power. He said lawmakers need to be recalled to keep a “close eye” on Johnson’s Brexit negotiations with the EU.
While it’s notoriously difficult to determine how a case will turn out from judges’ questions, Pannick had a much easier time during his 2 1/2 hours in front of the 11 members of the top court than Reed did in his first few minutes.
Pannick, however, did face queries about whether Parliament should have halted the possibility of prorogation by taking a no-confidence vote, which could have removed Johnson from office.
“My impression was that they gave Pannick quite an easy ride this morning,” Robert Hazell, constitutional law professor at University College London, said. “Not many of their questions to him were challenging, some of them appeared to be supportive. They appeared to give Keen a harder time. If I were the government after the first day, I think I would be feeling a bit more worried.”
The Supreme Court has to resolve a dispute between judges in Scotland -- who said the suspension of Parliament was unlawful -- and those in London who backed Johnson.
The stakes are high, as the process that started with an in-out referendum in June 2016 comes closer to the Halloween deadline set by Johnson. The prime minister told his cabinet this morning that he’s “confident” about the government’s arguments in the case.
As of the lunch break, the court had recorded more than 4 million requests to access the live-stream of the proceedings, a likely record for a European court case. And that didn’t include those watching the live coverage from the BBC and other news channels.

For three years, Brexit has divided voters, politicians and judges in the U.K. This week, the Supreme Court in London will try to reach a consensus over Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s suspension of Parliament, a decision that may affect a no-deal departure.Courts in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland delivered contradictory rulings on whether Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament was lawful or a political move to stymie lawmakers before the Oct. 31 deadline.  On Tuesday, several days of hearings will start as the 11-member panel tries to reconcile rulings from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.The judges, selected from the 12 members of the full court, will be forced to rule on issues that politicians have failed to address since the June 2016 referendum that started Britain’s exit from the European Union.  Earlier decisions have brought marches in the street and newspaper headlines referring to some judges as `Enemies of the People.’
Here is what you need to know about the judges hearing the case:
President
Age: 74
Year Appointed: 2009
Hale is a renowned academic, law reformer and judge, specializing in family law. In 2017, she became the court’s first female president since it replaced the House of Lords as the highest judicial authority 10 years ago. She has called for more diversity in the judiciary – where three-quarters of Supreme Court justices are male and all are white.
Before Hale became the court’s top judge, she was on the panel that ruled in 2017 that Parliament would have to approve government’s decision to notify the European Union that it would start the exit process. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Hale said she was “proud” of the case, because it was a classic constitutional issue “reminiscent of the 17th-century battle between Parliament and the King.”
Year Appointed: 2012
Reed, one of two Scottish justices on the Supreme Court, will succeed Hale when she retires in January. He was one of the three judges who dissented in the 2017 Brexit case.
Before working as an advocate and then a judge in both Scotland and England, primarily in commercial matters, he completed his doctorate researching the legal limits of government assistance to industry at University of Oxford.
Age: 71
Year Appointed: 2009
Kerr was the most senior judge in Northern Ireland, only the second Catholic to achieve this. He is the only representative from his country on the Supreme Court. He voted with the majority in the 2017 case.
Year Appointed: 2011
A former appeals judge and family law specialist, Wilson has been a critic of the government’s cuts to legal aid, which, he has argued, deny many people access to justice. He voted with the majority in the 2017 case.
Age: 74
Year Appointed: 2012
Carnwath is a former appeals judge with a particular interest in environmental issues. He was also one of the three dissenting judges in the 2017 ruling relating to Brexit, saying there wasn’t a direct precedent for withdrawing from a treaty like that with the EU.
Age: 66
Year Appointed: 2013
Hodge is the second of the Scottish judges hearing the case. He has had a varied career, including roles with the Department of Energy and Inland Revenue, and dealing with commercial law, judicial review and property law. He voted with the majority in the 2017 case.
Age: 65
Year Appointed: 2017
Black is another former appeals judge, who was a founding author of the definitive guide to family law in England and Wales. In a 2017 interview with the London-based Times newspaper, Black said she’s inspired by T.S. Eliot’s “Collected Poems“ because “whichever of life’s riddles I am trying to solve, I find something there to help.” She joined the Supreme Court after it ruled on the 2017 case.
Age: 67
Year Appointed: 2017
As a lawyer, Lloyd-Jones’s practice included international law and EU law. As well as litigating, he spent 22 years as an academic, mostly at the University of Cambridge. In 1999, he acted as a legal adviser to the House of Lords, then the highest judicial authority in the U.K., on whether former Chilean strongman Augusto Pinochet should be extradited to Spain. He joined the Supreme Court after it ruled on the 2017 case.

“We will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020,” Trump declared.
The state produced about 246 million barrels of oil in 2018, according to the Albuquerque Journal. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed a $7 billion budget earlier this year, according to the paper -- the state’s largest ever, including about $1.4 billion that was directed to reserves.
“Revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your state’s budget, generated a billion-dollar budget surplus in New Mexico,” Trump said. “Thank you very much, President Trump, thank you.”
But some Republicans concede Trump is unlikely to win the state. New Mexico has voted Republican only once in the last seven presidential elections -- in 2004 -- and the victor receives a mere five electoral college votes. That’s prompted questions about whether Trump’s visit, which must be paid for at least partly by his campaign, will take resources from swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania that the president will likely need in his column to win a second term.
“I think New Mexico is going to be a stretch for him under the best of circumstances,” said Colin Reed, a Republican strategist who called New Mexico a blue state that has “gotten bluer.”
“There are other states that I think will be more competitive come the general election,” he added.
Making matters more difficult for Trump, roughly half of the people who live in New Mexico are Latino, a population that tends to vote Democratic. His crackdown on immigration -- and on immigrants already living in the U.S. -- may make him an even harder sell.
Several people wearing shirts that read “Latinos for Trump” were positioned in risers directly behind him at his rally. His campaign recently debuted a Latino outreach program with the slogan “Vamos to Victory.”

“We’ve got a lot of Hispanics,” Trump said. “We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote.’’
After speaking in the Albuquerque suburb of Rio Rancho, Trump will continue to California for two days of campaign fundraising. When Trump campaigned in Albuquerque in 2016, an event was marred by violence between his supporters and opponents.
The president lost the state by more than eight percentage points in his first election, and it’s unlikely to play a decisive role next year. Democrats are also favored to retain the state’s U.S. Senate seat, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, with Representative Ben Ray Luján seeking to replace retiring Senator Tom Udall.
Even so, the visit underscores the Trump campaign’s ambitions to prevail in traditionally Democratic territory. The president tweeted Monday: “Big crowd expected in New Mexico tonight, where we will WIN.”
Republicans who cast doubt on his ability to carry New Mexico also said there’s no harm in a visit at this early stage of the campaign.
If he persists in trying to win the state, Trump could force Democrats to dedicate resources to a state they believe they have in their column, Reed said. Trump could even gain ground for the GOP if he attacks Democrats over the Green New Deal, he said. New Mexico is debating new restrictions on methane emissions Grisham has proposed as part of a plan to confront climate change.
“Under the Green New Deal that all goes away,” Trump said of the state’s oil industry. “The Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico’s economy.”
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Katrina Pierson plan to hold a “Vamos to Victory” roundtable event in Albuquerque on Tuesday, part of what the campaign has billed as a monthlong series of events celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. More than 49% of the state’s residents identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino, according to U.S. Census data.
Bolstering the president’s standing among those voters may be a necessity for 2020. Two in three Latinos voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to exit poll data, and Hispanic voters are expected to be the largest minority voter group -- outpacing blacks for the first time in American history -- in the upcoming elections, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center.
Campaign officials say that the decision to target New Mexico and Hispanic voters was born out of internal data showing positive trends they believe Trump can capitalize on. They said his economic record, energy policies and hard-line stance on immigration has made him more popular with Latinos than public polling data would indicate.

“The Trump campaign fully expects the president to win again where he won in 2016 and add new states to his column,” said Erin Perrine, a campaign spokeswoman. “That means he will compete in states like New Mexico and have the luxury of the financial resources to do so.”
The campaign disputed the notion that the New Mexico rally might hurt efforts in other more competitive states. Instead, campaign officials said it presented an opportunity to leverage an early financial advantage over Democrats.
A sizable number of attendees at the president’s rally in El Paso, Texas, earlier this year traveled to the event from neighboring New Mexico, according to the official who requested anonymity to discuss internal data.
“This is the perfect time to be testing the water in states like New Mexico to see if they might end up being competitive come 2020,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican consultant and former Trump White House official. “It’s not like we’re a week away from the election. We’re more than a year out, and so there’s no harm at all in looking for ways to potentially expand the map.”
In addition to the president’s events in the state, campaign officials have been testing how to pitch voters there on the president’s policies.
Trump’s critics in New Mexico were also looking to seize on the visit, with protesters planning demonstrations and Democratic lawmakers, including Luján, planning their own rally.

Apple Inc. is jumping into India’s crowded film and TV streaming market with services that could undercut premium global brands like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. that are also betting on growth in the country.
The technology giant’s Apple TV+ includes original content from filmmakers including M. Night Shymalan and will be available from Nov. 1 via the Apple TV app and on its devices, it said Tuesday. The service, priced at $4.99 a month in the U.S. and other markets, will sell for 99 rupees ($1.40) in India and includes “thousands” of movies to buy or rent, Apple said.
Apple Prices TV+ Video Service at $4.99 a Month, Hitting Netflix
The low monthly price may help Apple draw users in a market jammed with competitors vying for users driven by the appetite for film and TV entertainment, the wide use of mobile devices and cheap connectivity. The iPhone maker, which includes the service free for one year with purchase of a device, will be competing with some of India’s biggest broadcasters and Bollywood powerhouses along with billionaire-backed wireless carriers, who are luring users with free offers of as low as 40 cents a month.
Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings has said the company’s goal is to attract 100 million customers in India -- almost 25 times its estimated subscriber base there as of this year. The world’s second-most populous country is a priority for the No. 1 global streaming service, which is effectively blocked in China.

A bipartisan group of senators has told the Trump administration that they’re concerned about whether U.S. export controls are strong enough to prevent China from getting sensitive American technology through Hong Kong.
“We believe it is critical that the United States take appropriate measures to ensure China does not abuse Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law to steal or otherwise acquire critical or sensitive U.S. equipment and technologies in support of its strategic objectives or to infringe on the rights of people in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere,” the senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.
The move comes as more U.S. lawmakers question the special trading relationship with Hong Kong that underpins its economy as pro-democracy protests throw the financial hub into turmoil. While dual-use technology with consumer and military applications represent some 2 percent of U.S. exports to Hong Kong, restricting sales could potentially do irreparable harm to the city’s image as a safe hub for global business.

Thousands of protesters marched to the city’s U.S. consulate this weekend in an appeal to President Donald Trump. They support the passage of the U.S. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which is backed by prominent American lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and calls for annual assessments on whether the city is sufficiently autonomous from Beijing to continue its special trading status.
A U.S. government report said earlier this year that the city’s autonomy was “sufficient -- although diminished.”
Trump’s trade war with China is being waged in part over the issue of intellectual property theft as well as its drive for technological dominance. Members of Congress are adding objections to China’s use of technology to suppress dissent as pro-democracy protests rock Hong Kong.
A barricade set on fire by demonstrators burns at an entrance to Central Station, Sept. 8.
“The Chinese government has demonstrated its willingness to use both licit and illicit means to acquire and advance its development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, tools of mass surveillance, and advanced robotics, among others,” the senators write. “China is using these technologies not only to bolster its own industries, but also to advance its military capabilities and to infringe on the fundamental liberties of its citizens.”
The document is signed by Senators Jim Risch and Bob Menendez, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senators Mike Crapo and Sherrod Brown, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. It is also signed by Republican Senators Cory Gardner, Marco Rubio, and Pat Toomey, and Democratic Senators Ed Markey, Ben Cardin and Jack Reed.
China Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying pushed back Wednesday, saying senators were trying to “whitewash those illegal and even terrorist practices in Hong Kong” and “demonize” the city’s police force. China has described the U.S. as a “black hand” behind the protest movement.
“It is the U.S. politicians who tolerate and connive with these violent protesters that encourages the violent activities in Hong Kong,” Hua told reporters in Beijing. “Any person who wants to play with fire in Hong Kong affairs will only get themselves burned. We advise certain people in the U.S. to stop such absurd and silly practices and withdraw their hand from Hong Kong.”
The U.S. senators say they are also concerned about the export of police equipment, such as tear gas, rubber bullets and batons, “which may be used to suppress legitimate civil dissent.”
Why Hong Kong’s Still Protesting and Where It May Go: QuickTake
The senators asked for a response by Oct. 1, pointing out that the “situation continues to become more critical by the day.”
Although bans on police or crowd suppression equipment might be largely symbolic, a threat to start dismantling aspects of Hong Kong’s unique trading relationship with the U.S. could eventually harm the city’s standing as a gateway between China and the world, said Mathew Wong, an associate professor at the Education University of Hong Kong.
“It will definitely put pressure on Hong Kong as a trading hub and a financial center, because much of the investment flow to and from Hong Kong is because of this special status,” he said. “If there is no such distinction anymore, I don’t think foreign capital would particularly choose Hong Kong -- it would just go to Shanghai or other places.”"

Jekyll Island, Ga. (AP) -- Coast Guard rescuers pulled four trapped men alive from a capsized cargo ship Monday, drilling into the hull's steel plates to extract the crew members more than a day after their vessel overturned while leaving a Georgia port.
All four were described as alert and in relatively good condition and were taken to a hospital for further evaluation.
""Best day of my 16-year career,"" Lt. Lloyd Heflin, who was coordinating the effort, wrote in a text message to The Associated Press.
A video posted online by the Coast Guard showed responders clapping and cheering as the final man, wearing only shorts, climbed out of a hole in the hull and stood up.
Three of the South Korean crew members came out in the midafternoon. The fourth man, who was trapped in a separate compartment, emerged three hours later.
The rescues followed nearly 36 hours of work after the Golden Ray, a giant ship that carries automobiles, rolled onto its side early Sunday as it was leaving Brunswick, bound for Baltimore.
""All crew members are accounted for,"" Coast Guard Southeast wrote on Twitter. ""Operations will now shift fully to environmental protection, removing the vessel and resuming commerce.""
South Korean President Moon Jae-in sent a letter to President Donald Trump to express gratitude over the successful rescue of the men, saying that the news brought ""huge relief and joy"" to South Koreans.
The presidential Blue House said Moon also sent a letter to U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Karl Schultz and praised the ""courage and dedication"" of Coast Guard members involved in the rescue.
In the hours immediately after the accident, the Coast Guard lifted 20 crew members into helicopters before determining that smoke and flames and unstable cargo made it too risky to venture further inside the vessel. Officials were concerned that some of the 4,000 vehicles aboard may have broken loose.
That left responders looking for the remaining four crew members. At first, rescuers thought the noises they were hearing inside could be some of the vehicles crashing around. But by dawn Monday, they were confident that the taps were responses to their own taps, indicating someone was alive inside.
""It was outstanding when I heard the news this morning that we had taps back throughout the night,"" Capt. John Reed said. Those sounds helped lead rescuers to the right place on the 656-foot (200 meter) vessel and provided motivation.
""They were charged up knowing the people were alive,"" Reed said.
On Monday morning, rescuers landed on the side of the Golden Ray and rappelled down the hull. Heflin, who was coordinating the search, said they found three men in a room close to the propeller shaft, near the bottom of the stern. Responders began drilling, starting with a 3-inch (7.5-centimeter) hole. Coast Guard officials brought the ship's chief engineer, who was rescued Sunday, out to the ship to translate, and found the three men were ""on board and OK,"" as Heflin put it.
Reed said rescuers passed food and water through the hole to the men. They also provided fresh air to the propeller room, which Reed said was even hotter than outside, where the high was 93 degrees (34 Celsius).
Responders set up a tent on the hull and began drilling additional holes, eventually making an opening large enough to insert a ladder and help the men climb out.
""It was like connect the dots,"" Reed said of the hole, which grew to 2 feet by 3 feet (0.6 meters by 1 meter).
The fourth rescue was a greater challenge. That crewman was behind glass in a separate engineering compartment on another deck, Reed said.
The Golden Ray is now stuck in the shipping channel, closing one of the busiest U.S. seaports for shipping automobiles. One ship is unable to leave port and four more are lined up outside waiting to come in, according to ship-tracking website Marine Traffic.
A statement issued Monday by the South Korea foreign ministry said the crew members were isolated in an engine room. It said 10 South Koreans and 13 Filipinos had been on board, along with a U.S. harbor pilot, when the ship began tilting.
Position records for the Golden Ray show the ship arrived in port in Brunswick Saturday evening after making the short sail from a prior stop in Jacksonville, Florida. The ship then departed the dock in Brunswick shortly after midnight and was underway only 23 minutes before its movement stopped in the mouth of the harbor where it capsized, according to satellite data recorded by Marine Traffic.
Port officials were ""working closely with the Coast Guard to reopen the channel,"" Georgia Ports Authority Executive Director Griff Lynch said in a statement after the final man was rescued.
The cause of the capsizing remains under investigation. Marine Traffic shows the Golden Ray overturned as it was passed by another car carrier entering St. Simons Sound.
At the time, the skies were clear and the weather calm, with a southerly breeze of only 5 miles per hour, according to National Weather Service records.
Many of those rescued were taken to the International Seafarers' Center in Brunswick. Sailors arrived with only what they were wearing when rescued. A restaurant donated a meal, and the volunteer-run center provided the seamen with clothes, toiletries and Bibles.
The vessel is owned by Hyundai Glovis, which carries cars for automakers Hyundai and Kia as well as others.
In a statement, the company thanked the Coast Guard for saving the crew and sought to assure the public that it would now focus on ""mitigating damage to property and the environment.""

Hudson, whose almost 30-year career in the industry includes senior positions in Spain, Japan and Switzerland, relishes the outsider role. When he takes over from Olivier Brandicourt in Paris this week, he will be among the few non-French executives at the helm of a major corporation in the country.
“I fear nothing about culture,” Hudson told Bloomberg News. “I have a simple approach: immerse yourself in where you go.”
Investors will judge him not on his accent, but his ability to fire up the drugmaker’s research engine, expand in the lucrative but competitive cancer market and tack through pricing headwinds. Defining Sanofi’s ambitions in the cutting-edge field of gene therapies and figuring out whether to hold on to consumer health brands are among other priorities.
The former pharma head at Novartis AG is credited with rolling out drugs such as Cosentyx for psoriasis, set to become the Swiss company’s top seller. In his new role, he’ll need to deliver more blockbusters to reduce Sanofi’s reliance on Dupixent, its standout medicine for severe eczema and asthma.
“What you really need is a nose for good products, and he has that,” said Bruno Strigini, who worked with Hudson at Novartis before stepping down as the CEO of the Basel-based company’s cancer division two years ago.
When he joined Novartis in 2016, Hudson spent his first hours focusing heavily on a heart drug called Entresto that got off to a sluggish start. After he ramped up marketing, the therapy hit its stride and is forecast to rack up $1.7 billion in sales this year.
“I saw enough in my first day to know it had changed patients’ lives,” he said. “By the time I got to headquarters in Basel, I knew we had a medicine; the question was how we were going to get to that potential.”
Now, the new CEO points to Sanofi treatments for multiple myeloma, breast cancer and rare blood disorders, along with a vaccine for RSV, the respiratory virus, as some of the most promising opportunities. He’s signaling bolder ambitions in China, partly through tech partnerships. In the coming months, he’ll carry out a “deep dive” of the pipeline and closely examine how each unit, including consumer health, fits within the company.
“We should be looking critically across the portfolio,” he said. “The green shoots of a return to growth are there. My job is to pick that up and run fast.”
Sanofi is one of the biggest makers of diabetes medicines. But with prices for those drugs under mounting pressure, it’s prioritizing a faster-growing side of the industry that includes cancer therapies that are extending lives while fattening bottom lines at Merck & Co., AstraZeneca Plc, and Roche Holding AG.
Outgoing CEO Brandicourt and new research head John Reed had already begun sifting through drugs under development to accelerate the company’s best prospects. Still, Sanofi is behind in cancer, a specialized treatment area, and may further winnow the pipeline as its rivals have.
“I suspect they will double down on specialty care because that’s where the growth is most likely going to come from,” said Ed Corbett, a consultant at Novasecta Ltd. in London. “That requires making some tough calls, probably doing some M&A and continuing to streamline R&D.”
During the Brandicourt era, Sanofi’s track record with acquisitions was mixed and failed to spur the shares. The stock had slipped 12% over the past four years through Friday, compared with a 78% gain for Astra, but rose as much as 1.2% on Monday. In July, the French company took a 1.8 billion-euro ($2 billion) charge and reduced sales estimates for Eloctate, the hemophilia drug gained in the takeover of Bioverativ.
Despite that disappointment, more deals would be the fastest way to build up Sanofi’s stable of medicines and profile in cancer, analysts at HSBC wrote in an Aug. 2 note. There may also be temptation to follow companies like GlaxoSmithKline Plc that have distanced themselves from lower-margin consumer health businesses to focus on discovering new drugs. Novartis also spun off its Alcon eye-care operation and exited consumer health during Hudson’s tenure, and similar products may be in the spotlight at Sanofi, too.
“The external environment is changing quite quickly so we have to decide who the best owner is,” Hudson said, adding that he plans to provide more detail about company strategy at a meeting in December. The company routinely evaluates areas like consumer health, vaccines and rare diseases to look at how best to participate in them, and hasn’t made any decisions about changes, Hudson said.
Unloading its consumer division, which sells products for coughs, colds, pain and other ailments and generated more than $5 billion in 2018 sales, could make sense for Sanofi.
“There’s a greater chance they will do something,” said Markus Manns, a fund manager for Union Investment, a Sanofi shareholder. “New management likes to show they’re taking action, and investors at the moment tend to reward companies for splitting up.”
Unlike Brandicourt, who studied medicine and science, Hudson specialized in economics. Born in 1967, he graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University in 1990. He received job offers from oil and retail companies but was drawn to health care, and his first assignment was a 13-week training course on asthma.
Early experience in sales has been valuable for Hudson, said Richard Francis, the former chief of Novartis’s generics unit who has known him since their days at the English university. “That helped him stay very close to the customer.”
Hudson isn’t Sanofi’s first non-French CEO, but Canadian-German Chris Viehbacher, who led the drugmaker before Brandicourt, spoke the language and once managed the country’s operations for Glaxo.
Yet he’s a rarity in France. When Canadian Ben Smith was appointed Air France-KLM CEO in 2018, unions said the choice was inconceivable.
Like Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s move in 2015 to make Christophe Weber its first foreign CEO, Sanofi’s decision may carry a message. “It’s clearly going to be a challenge,” said Fouzia Laghrissi-Thode, who worked with Hudson at Astra before becoming CEO of DalCor Pharmaceuticals. “But it’s a good opportunity for Sanofi to project a more international mindset.”
In earlier roles, Hudson said, he learned enough Spanish to run meetings and delivered speeches in Japanese. Now he’s tackling French, and preparing once again for the pros and cons of being the newcomer.
“If I lack respect, and I’m just fresh eyes with a playbook pre-formed, I’ll get what I deserve,” he said. “If I come with a dispassionate, critical but constructive viewpoint that will allow people’s work to get to places they never thought was possible, then it’s an advantage.”

U.S. airlines, opposed to subsidies for foreign competitors paid by Qatar, took the same broadcast route to the viewer-in-chief, urging him to oppose “trade cheating.”
While the ads generate a small portion of the network’s income -- many are local spots airing only in Washington -- the phenomenon points to the unusual symbiosis between a conservative president and conservative opinion programs that boosted his political fortunes. Trump’s penchant for sharing his viewing habits with regular tweets to his millions of followers in turn helps drive viewers to the shows.
“When it comes to reaching President Trump or communicating a message to him, it might be more effective to buy ads on Fox News than it would be to have an actual conversation with him,” Nick Everhart, president of Republican ad firm Content Creative Media, said in an email.
Advertisers long have sought to reach influential people, such as legislators and their staff, for instance by running ads on Sunday TV talk shows that are viewed by the political class, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
What’s new is the certainty that a president would be watching a program such as ""Fox & Friends,"" Jamieson said.
“The underlying problem isn’t that these folks have figured out to buy ads targeted to the president,” Jamieson said in an interview. “The problem is that the president gets his information from these shows.”
The National Biodiesel Board is among groups buying ads aimed directly at Trump. The group wanted Trump’s backing in a fight.
“We ran our ad on Fox television for one week and online for two because we are aware that the president watches that channel and often reacts to it,” said Paul Winters, a spokesman for the board.
Oil industry advocates on the other side of the issue shot back with their own ads, with the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers purchasing time on Fox programming in Washington, D.C. The ad featured smiling refinery workers in hard hats and said, “President Trump, only you can fix this.” At issue was whether to give refineries exemptions from requirements to buy fuels made from corn and soybeans.
Fox’s political-ad spending reports filed at the Federal Communications Commission show robust spending on programs that figure in Trump’s viewing.
One destination for the targeted ads is the morning program “Fox & Friends.” Its hosts have fielded live calls from Trump and landed interviews with the president, who in turn lauds the show to his 64 million Twitter followers. The show has attracted at least $238,250 political ads bought in the Washington, D.C. market, this year, according to Advertising Analytics, a media intelligence firm based in Alexandria, Virginia.
According to Advertising Analytics, other Fox programs attracting political ads inserted into spots reserved for local programming in the Washington market included “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” “The Ingraham Angle,” featuring Laura Ingraham, and “Hannity” featuring Sean Hannity -- all of which have attracted presidential tweets.
U.S. airlines ran an ad on Fox News before the leader of the Middle Eastern nation Qatar visited Trump in July. The airlines, which accuse Qatar of unfair subsidies, have formed a group called Partnership for Open & Fair Skies that includes American Airlines Group Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc.
Their ad in May asked Trump to crack down, opening with a clip of the president at a podium saying, “We will stand up to trade cheating.” The partnership told supporters the ad was running on Fox & Friends, according to a person briefed on the matter.
The partnership declined to discuss details of the ad-time purchase. It sent an emailed statement from Scott Reed, its managing partner, which said, “American workers are counting on President Trump to stand up for U.S. jobs and fair competition.”
In a White House meeting in July, U.S. airlines failed to win Trump’s intervention.
Foreign-headquartered automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG in 2017 bought time on Fox & Friends to tout their American-made vehicles.
Trump-seeking ads aren’t limited to business topics. After a gunman espousing anti-immigrant views killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro bought time on Fox & Friends in Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump was staying at a golf club he owns.
The spot was intended “to send a message to @realDonaldTrump on his vacation: words have consequences, and we’ve had enough,” Castro said in a tweet. In the ad Castro said Trump had “stoked the fire of racists.”
Fox said in a statement, “FOX News has been the most-watched cable news network for more than 17 years and the top network in all of cable for the last three years which is why we continue to be a premiere destination.”
Fox News, like other news channels, enjoyed a ratings bump during the last presidential election cycle, and the ongoing volatile political environment continues to drive viewership of cable news. Fox has largely led cable news viewing for years, with a sizable lead across different demographics and times of day in recent years, ahead of CNN and MSNBC.
Fox & Friends has been the top-rated morning show in cable news for 214 months in a row, according to Nielsen ratings.
On occasion, Trump has expressed his displeasure with Fox, but with nowhere near the gusto he reserves for news outlets such as the New York Times or CNN. On Wednesday, he took Fox to task on Twitter for “heavily promoting the Democrats” by interviewing a Democratic National Committee official with “zero pushback” -- even though some of the network’s hosts have faced criticism for not pushing back during interviews with Trump.
“The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn’t working for us anymore!” Trump said in another tweet.
The network has been the target of ad boycotts in the past -- for instance, Bill O’Reilly, a host who faced allegations of sexual harassment, was ousted after dozens of advertisers fled his top-rated show. Other hosts, such as Ingraham, also have been hit by boycott calls.
But by catching and holding Trump’s attention, the network has offset some of those losses with messages aimed directly at the West Wing.
Selling the ads is possible because of the unconventional decision-making of a president who watches a lot of TV “and relies less on the advice and counsel of advisers, and more on his gut,"" said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who tracks political advertising.
“It’s a perfect storm which suggests people should advertise on the shows that the person who is deciding is watching,” Goldstein said.
Everhart, the ad firm executive, said that running an ad on Fox News “is only topped by the commentary of Fox News hosts and guests at driving the president’s agenda and grabbing his attention.”

When a Chinese state-owned survey vessel sailed into waters off Vietnam’s coast in early July, it unleashed a high-seas standoff with trillions of dollars at stake that risks drawing in Russia and the U.S.
For weeks now the Haiyang Dizhi 8 has zigzagged across a square block of water to study the seabed in an active drilling block operated by Russia’s state-owned Rosneft Oil PJSC. Satellite images show more than a dozen Chinese and Vietnamese coast guard ships maneuvering around the surveyor, which at one point included a heavily-armored Chinese cutter known as “The Beast” that is larger than most American destroyers.
The location is particularly worrying for smaller countries looking to extract oil and gas from disputed parts of the South China Sea: It sits three times closer to Vietnam than the Chinese mainland. While Beijing has long sought to disrupt exploration in parts of the sea that fall under its expansive claims, its naval buildup and moves to construct military assets on disputed reefs over the past decade have allowed it to more aggressively assert its interests further from its shores.
“It’s the growing intensity or frequency of these occurrences that truly differs from the past,” said Collin Koh, a research fellow from Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. The current standoff “could’ve sufficed to make investors think twice about staying on that offshore project, and this might even serve as a deterrence to future investors who might want to anticipate and avoid being embroiled in such troubles.”
The Chinese move comes just as it’s holding negotiations on joint exploration in a disputed area with the Philippines, which has sought closer ties with Beijing since President Rodrigo Duterte came to power. Vietnam has persistently rejected China’s nine-dash line map of the sea as a basis for cooperating on energy resources, prompting tensions to increase as Beijing’s military strength grows.
The U.S. this week criticized China’s move to send the survey to Vietnam as “an escalation by Beijing in its efforts to intimidate other claimants out of developing resources in the South China Sea.” The State Department statement said China was blocking Southeast Asian nations from accessing an estimated $2.5 trillion in unexploited hydrocarbon resources.

For Vietnam -- a country that produced 22-33 million tons of oil from its offshore blocks each year, and has as much as 4.4 billion tons in crude oil and gas reserves there -- armed Chinese ships within its maritime border could have a devastating impact on an industry that made up 20% of Vietnam’s GDP from 1986-2009.
China defended the provocation, saying Vietnam should not have carried out its decision in May to unilaterally begin exploitation work in a “Chinese jurisdiction.”
“This is the cause of the current situation,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Friday.
Rosneft declined to comment.
While the Philippines produces very little offshore oil and gas by comparison, data shows deposits in the disputed Reed Bank to the west could amount to as much as 5.4 billion barrels and 55.1 trillion cubic feet of oil and gas respectively. Any attempt to extract it however would likely face strong resistance from China.
“Anything that the Philippines tries to do, particularly at Reed Bank, is going to met with the same kind of response that we’re seeing right now off the coast of Vietnam,” said Gregory Poling, director of the Washington-based think-tank Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.
Weekly transgressions from China near its coast has also cast a shadow over Duterte’s final years in office amid his pursuit of warmer ties with Beijing. The Philippine Armed Forces said this month they’ve consistently spotted armed Chinese warships sailing through its territorial waters since early July. The presence of Chinese surveyors in its exclusive economic zone this month prompted a diplomatic protest, said Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin, who was mindful that China now has the largest naval force in the region.
“Our nightmare -- we send a ship and a big Chinese ship laughs at it. What do we do,” Locsin wrote in an email. “They claim it is all theirs. We claim it is all ours.”
This all follows the deployment of a maritime militia and so-called fishing fleets known to harass fisherman throughout the region. A high-profile incident in June included a Chinese vessel colliding with a trawler, leaving 22 Filipino fishermen stranded at sea.
“It is indicative of how much China has expanded its operations in and through Filipino waters on account of the government’s accommodation of China,” Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea.
With Duterte and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping set to discuss recent activities in the South China Sea later this month in Beijing, Xi will be hoping to make progress on a joint exploration deal that would serve as a major concession in the ongoing code of conduct negotiations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
According to a leaked draft of the negotiating text of the code of conduct dated June 2018 and seen by Bloomberg, China has stated its intention to achieve exclusive joint explorations in the South China Sea by eliminating any foreign presence. The draft also expresses China’s intent to win veto rights over any joint military exercises with foreign militaries and attain regular joint patrols with Southeast Asian countries.
The pursuit of such an agreement demonstrates Beijing’s resolve in win administrative control within its so-called “nine-dash line” encompassing some 80% of the South China Sea, while recent incidents openly challenge a 2016 Hague Tribunal ruling.
Observers say the increased hostilities in the South China Sea may be an attempt by China to coerce the 10-nation bloc to yield to China’s demands within a self-imposed deadline of three years -- when Duterte’s term comes to an end.
“These actions are designed to shape the other parties’ calculus to take into account their interests with China in mind,” said Koh.
With Vietnam less likely to yield to such pressure, China has engaged in several high-stakes deployments in recent weeks, including conducting two military exercises near the disputed Paracel Islands, lifting a controversial fishing ban and testing new warships and weapons in the Gulf of Tonkin, prompting concerns the two nations may wind up in open conflict.
“This is the most tense we have seen the relationship between Vietnam and China in five years,” said Poling from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. “Even if things are relatively quiet, they don’t seem like they are going to stay that way.”
China has repeatedly talked down the escalation calling on Vietnam to respect China’s sovereign rights.
“China hopes to join hands with regional countries to maintain stability in this area, with a focus on the negotiation of the code of conduct,” Zhu Feng, executive dean of The Collaborative Innovation Center of South China Sea Studies at Nanjing University, said during a phone interview.
In an attempt defend their maritime claims as well as wade the growing geopolitical rift between the U.S. and China, Asean in June adopted its own version of an Indo-Pacific strategy in June, though its own signatories admit it has serious limitations.
“Southeast Asia had best focus its attention and confine its resources to the South China Sea instead of looking farther out in pursuit of a policy that reeks of containment,” said Philippine Foreign Minister Locsin.

Heat and humidity blister the Lone Star State and much of the U.S. southern rim, an analysis finds
Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout cools off in the dugout during a baseball game against the Texas Rangers in Arlington, Texas on Aug. 20. 
On Tuesday afternoon, the Texas Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels were the hottest teams in baseball. A high-pressure system pushed the temperature in Arlington to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. With the humidity, it felt like 110. 
Jamie Reed, the Rangers’ senior director of medical operations, gave players the usual advice: Keep drinking and load up on foods with greater water content. 
The temperature trends in Texas, though, are anything but usual. America’s meteorologists issue excessive heat warnings when the heat index—designed to capture the feeling outside in the shade, with a light breeze—surges past 105 degrees for more than two hours. Texas is home to six of the 10 U.S. cities with the largest increase in excessive-heat days, including Houston and Austin.Even in ostensibly cooler places, the temperature is rising. Dallas now sees about 14.5 more days above 90 degrees than it did in 1979, according to a new analysis by the research nonprofit Climate Central. 
Overheating Texas cities outrank those in neighboring states by a considerable margin.  McAllen, in the state’s south, has seen 31.6 more 90-degree days since 1979. Tyler, about 100 miles southeast of Dallas, comes in seventh, with 22.1 more scorchers. These cities endure further hardship when humidity enters the mix, which is the focus of the Climate Central analysis. Being out in the sun, as athletes usually are, can add 15 degrees to the experience.  
It’s not news that Texas gets hot. It’s news that it’s gotten so much hotter just since “We Are Family” was the song of the summer. The Climate Central analysis dates to 1979, when the University of Idaho’s  gridMET temperature database begins. The study uses methodology similar to a U.S. heat analysis earlier this summer, led by Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. 
“What's great about this study is that it takes a look at how conditions have changed in our lifetime,” Dahl said of the new analysis. Texas already has a lot of days in the high 80s. “They just need a little bit of a nudge from global warming to get over that 90-degree threshold.”
Such extreme heat can be deadly, especially under conditions of high exertion. Korey Stringer, a Minnesota Vikings offensive linesman, died of heat stroke during training camp in August in 2001. The University of Connecticut in 2010 opened the Korey Stringer Institute to focus on research, education, and advocacy to protect athletes, soldiers and workers from what’s called exertional heat stroke and other heat-related dangers.The institute scores states based on their adherence to a set of policies that states prevent high-school athletes from heat-related illness. Low- or no-cost precautions include developing an emergency plan, acclimating players to higher temperatures well before a game and having a cold-water tank on hand in case someone overheats, said Doug Casa, CEO of the Korey Stringer Institute.
Texas teams have developed their own strategies to protect their players. Texas institutions have rapidly moved to bring outdoor athletics indoors. A 2016 Dallas Morning News report found that in the previous 20 years, Texans had spent about $500 million on 144 indoor practice facilities. In 2000, there were just 23 such facilities. 
The Rangers provide players with an air-conditioned room just off the dugout. There’s a weather bulletin in the locker room when they enter, and water or electrolyte-heavy drinks are widely available. Restrooms even feature color-coded urine charts so that a player can check his hue and see if he’s drinking enough.
The heat is rough on fans as well. Attendance for Tuesday’s day-game with the Angels was just 17,000, roughly 10,000 lower than the season’s average. The Angels won 5-1, then lost 3-2 in the nightcap. Next year, everyone will win: the Rangers’ new air-conditioned ballpark is scheduled to open during the 2020 season.

Sam Walton
Sam Walton would probably be bewildered by the businesses his grandchildren have chosen to pursue, but the late founder of the world’s largest family fortune would likely have applauded their initiative.
Grandson Ben Walton, 44, owns Zoma Capital, which makes investments in areas such as energy and water. His cousins Steuart and Tom bought Rapha, a high-end British cycling brand, for a reported $225 million in 2017. Tom’s Ropeswing Group operates an assortment of restaurants in Bentonville, Arkansas, that target millennials.
“The Walton family has groomed the next generation as a generation of entrepreneurs,” said Byron Trott, founder of merchant bank BDT Capital Partners, who advises some of the world’s richest families.
Their high-profile investments mark a change from the previous generation, who are now in their late 60s and 70s. Despite their staggering wealth, Alice, Jim, Rob and the late John Walton kept their investments and ventures largely under wraps. But that’s changing as the younger Waltons exert more influence.
See the list: The Richest Families in the World
The most visible signs are in the family’s hometown. Bentonville features a clutch of trendy bars and eateries, including the Holler, a warehouse-size establishment featuring shuffleboard lanes and plant-based burgers, and Undercroft, a speakeasy below a historic church that’s now a high-end restaurant.
They’re all part of Ropeswing, which aims to remake Bentonville into a destination for young workers and their families. Bicycle trails that crisscross the town’s outskirts are the first step in plans by Tom and brother Steuart, both in their 30s, to turn Bentonville into a cycling mecca, while Steuart co-founded a company that makes aerobatic and touring airplanes. An unnamed Walton family member now sits on the board of FoodMaven, a startup that sells discounted surplus food, in which the family has an investment.
There are other signs of the younger generation’s growing influence. Three of the five members of the family foundation’s board now hail from that cohort. They include Lukas Walton, 32, who has the right to vote the general and limited partner units in Walton Enterprises of his father’s estate, court documents show. Steuart replaced his father Jim, 71, on the board of Walmart Inc. in 2016.
Kiki McLean, a spokeswoman for the family, declined to comment.
Managing such generational transitions is one of the top priorities for the world’s richest families. About $3.4 trillion of billionaire wealth is expected to be transferred over the next two decades, PwC said in a 2018 report, and succession planning is a dominant concern.
“Family succession is difficult,” said Quentin Marshall, head of private banking at Weatherbys. “As the family expands, interests diverge.”
There’s no common template. While other wealthy dynasties like the  Kochs have sought to keep family members atop the business, the Waltons have long outsourced the running of Walmart to professional managers. Steuart and his uncle Rob, 74, sit on the retailer’s board, but most of the extended family focus their energies outside the company.
Any diversification away from Walmart would no doubt be applauded by the family’s risk managers. The stock declined 3% this month through Wednesday amid a wider market swoon, knocking about $5 billion from the family fortune before shares bounced back 6% on Thursday, buoyed by strong second-quarter sales.
For now, the family’s holdings outside of Walmart are a fraction of their overall wealth, which is still anchored by the retailer Sam Walton founded in 1950. Bentonville-based investment vehicle Walton Enterprises LLC holds a 50% stake in Walmart—valued at about $160 billion.
That is shifting. The family’s Walmart stake paid out about $3 billion of dividends over the past year, while the Walton Family Holdings Trust has sold $10 billion of Walmart shares in the past three years. Today about $40 billion of the family’s wealth is held outside of Walmart stock, according to calculations by Bloomberg.
Internal Revenue Service filings show how $9 billion of the Walton fortune was deployed at the end of 2016. They detail the investments of 21 trusts set up by the estates of Sam’s widow Helen and son John.
In some ways, their investments are a microcosm of trends sweeping the wider market. Passive funds predominate, with about $4 billion stashed in vehicles such as Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF or Northern Trust Russell Index. A further $2 billion is in active funds.

Note: Values as of Dec. 31, 2016
About $2 billion is in private equity, venture and hedge funds. The money is spread across a host of star names, including $81 million in Cliff Asness’s AQR Capital Management, $190 million in Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management and $71 million in Ole Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global Investors.

The younger generation is investing some of those returns in their own varied ventures. It’s all part of an approach that enables the family to reposition itself for the future, according to Trott.
“You have family leadership at the board level, non-family management leading the operating company and other family members working as innovative investors and entrepreneurs,” he said.

They are.,"Good afternoon from Los Angeles, wherever you may be. I just got back from my friend Adam’s bachelor party in Lake Tahoe, and am pleased to report that everyone emerged in one piece. The weekend provided a welcome reprieve from the one topic that I can’t escape lately (other than Donald Trump): the streaming race of 2019.
I must admit that at times I struggle to get excited about this story. A half-dozen media and technology giants are all creating more or less the same product – a streaming service with thousands of titles, some original and some licensed. They are all using the same name generator: HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, ESPN+. 
But the race to copy Netflix is going to be the dominant entertainment story for at least the next couple years as media companies invest billions of dollars in new shows, movies and technology. 
Just this week we got another important update. On the heels of a disappointing earnings report, Disney CEO Bob Iger disclosed the price of a forthcoming Disney streaming bundle: he will sell Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ for $12.99 a month.
Customers are paying the base price for Hulu (with advertisements) and Disney+, and getting ESPN+ for free. That should boost ESPN+, which hasn’t exactly set the world on fire since its debut last year. It turns out there is a finite number of people who want to pay for the ultimate fighting championship and second-tier college sports. 
The bundle’s price is the same price as Netflix, and thus set off the inevitable freakout about the incipient war between Reed Hastings’ technocrats from the north and Iger’s Mickey Mouse Club. Chris Palmeri’s story had the headline: ""Disney Goes After Netflix With $13-a-Month Streaming Bundle.""
Iger dismissed this framing, insisting his company isn’t just creating another Netflix. ""I know there’s a lot that’s been speculated about us going after them. We're not,” Iger told Julia Boorstin. He is not alone. AT&T, Apple and Comcast all stress they aren’t trying to compete with Netflix. Why? Because they then get compared directly to its customer base and programming budget. Netflix is spending way more money on programming than they are, they claim.
But let’s get real here. They are all creating streaming services because of Netflix's success, and they are all increasing their programming budgets so they have enough fresh material to entice customers every day. Netflix has created the default for watching TV on the internet, and that's bad news for other media companies.
No current streaming service offers an experience that is fundamentally different from Netflix. If anything, most of them offer a slightly worse experience. (Comcast’s will have ads, as Hulu already does).
One potential point of differentiation is price, but Disney’s announcement underscores that Disney+ on its own is not a direct competitor to Netflix. It is a service for families, and will not offer something for everyone.  Disney+ and Hulu combined should offer the full range of what anyone can get from Netflix, from documentaries and adult animation to adult drama and blockbuster movies. HBO Max is going to be more expensive than Netflix, but in the same ballpark. Apple hasn't said much about pricing.
That leaves one way in which Disney and its peers will differ from Netflix: programming. Disney and AT&T will lean on their libraries – a huge advantage – while everyone will try to program new hit original series. Some will succeed and some will fail, but they are all aiming for the same target.  – Lucas Shaw
Ed Sheeran broke U2’s record for the highest-grossing tour in history. The record is a bit of a stretch since Sheeran went back on the road after the tour's planned conclusion just to break the record. That being said, this is as good a time as any to reflect on Sheeran’s status as the No. 1 touring act in the world. 
Forget Beyonce. Forget Taylor Swift. Forget U2. Sheeran booked the best-selling tour of last year by a huge margin. Sheeran sold 2 million more tickets than any other artist last year. He grossed $87 million more than anyone despite having one of the cheaper tours (relative to other big tours). His music also keeps selling and selling and selling.
Now his show is *easier* than those other pop stars. Swift and Beyonce orchestrate massive productions. Beyonce dances. Swift prances. And P!nk trapezes. But there is nobody who sells tickets like Sheeran, at least for now.
 The No. 1 movie in the world is… ""Hobbs & Shaw."" The spin-off from the “Fast and Furious” franchise grossed $85 million worldwide this past weekend, and has now eclipsed $330 million during its first couple weeks. “Dora and the Lost City of Gold,” a live-action movie based on TV’s “Dora the Explorer” cartoons, grossed just $17 million in North America.
The No. 1 album in the U.S. is NF's ""The Search."" That's a surprise since Chance the Rapper also released a new album. But critical appraisals of Chance's new record range from outright damning to faint praise. 
After three years, two stalled negotiations and one big sexual harassment scandal, CBS and Viacom are finally going to tie the knot. 
The two sides have agreed on most of the terms that are a prerequisite to a deal. Viacom CEO Bob Bakish will lead the combined company. CBS CFO Christina Spade will be the CFO, and interim CEO Joe Ianniello will have a role. CBS will have six board members, and Viacom will have four. The Redstone family will retain control of the whole shebang.
Most sources expect the two sides to reach a final deal as soon as this week, and by the end of the month at the latest. That deal could just be the start for the two companies. A combined CBS-Viacom is still a minnow compared to Disney, Comcast and AT&T, and a slew of smaller companies, such as MGM and Lions Gate, could be the Redstone family's next target.
But merging CBS and Viacom is a good start if the long-term plan is to create a streaming service that has as much firepower as those discussed above. All Access and Showtime already have a combined 8 million subscribers, and would benefit mightily from Paramount’s large library and the output of youth-focused programming from Viacom’s cable networks.
That’s the headline of the latest piece from Gerry Smith.
Last quarter, commercial time rose 1%, according to analyst Michael Nathanson. After declining in 2017, the volume of ads increased every quarter last year and expanded again in the first half of 2019. Fox was the only major cable network group to lower its ads last quarter, cutting the amount of air time by 2%. 
As TV viewership declines and more consumers jump to streaming services like Netflix, media companies have only a couple of options to generate the advertising revenue that Wall Street expects: They can raise prices, run more commercials or do a little of both.
“Look at the decline in ratings,” Nathanson said. “Everyone’s got pressure to make their quarterly numbers. Long-term, it’s a very bad decision, but you don’t want to miss your numbers and have your stock go down.”
But… TV networks had a good upfront sales season because of how bad ratings are. The less supply of advertising inventory, the more they can charge. Marketers are happy to pay higher premiums because they still see TV as an effective, and essential, part of their spend.
Chinese technology giant Tencent is in talks to acquire a minority stake in Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record label.
Vivendi has been shopping a piece of UMG for a long time now, and many industry observers thought this day would never come. But Tencent has always made the most sense. 
All the big music companies are looking to increase the audience for their artists in China, and Tencent-affiliated companies operate the dominant music streaming services in the country.
It remains to be seen whether Tencent will give UMG artists any advantages. That wouldn’t sit well with the other major labels, Sony and Warner, both of whom have distribution deals with Tencent.
Lots of big news in podcasting land this week, all of which points to the same conclusion: more and more companies are taking podcasting seriously. 
International flavor: iHeartMedia, the largest radio station owner in the U.S., will start translating some of its big podcasts into other languages. Podcast listenership has exploded in some foreign markets, per Spotify.
More $$ coming in: Entercom, the second largest station owner, acquired two podcasting companies in deals worth more than $70 million.
Easier to find: Google will start showing individual podcast episodes in search results. That should increase listenership.
Universal Pictures canceled the release of “The Hunt,” a movie in which liberals hunt down conservatives. The studio had already halted marketing after the recent mass shootings.
YouTube moderators told Elizabeth Dwoskin that the video site holds its biggest stars to a different standard than regular creators. They are allowed to break the rules.
China banned its movie stars and filmmakers from attending the Golden Horse Awards, Taiwan’s version of the Oscars. At last year’s awards, a filmmaker advocated for Taiwan’s continued independence from China, a sore point for Chinese Premier Xi Jinping.
Tech companies have long shielded themselves from legal scrutiny using a small section in a federal law from 1996. Now lawmakers and regulators want to make some changes.

Apollo Global Management LLC co-president Jim Zelter knows what many on the Street are thinking.
Why would a private-equity firm -- whose name is synonymous with acquiring struggling businesses on the cheap and turning them around for huge profits -- make a $1.8 billion loan to a company in the beleaguered newspaper industry if it didn’t expect to own it one day?
When it comes to the financing of New Media Investment Group Inc.’s takeover of Gannett Co., he insists that’s not the plan. In fact, Zelter, a former banker who led the expansion of Apollo’s credit investment arm, says the rationale behind the firm’s largest-ever direct-lending commitment is simple: He believes the new company can thrive.
“This was always meant to be a performing loan,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s not a distressed-for-control transaction.”

Zelter -- who oversees about $200 billion of credit investments, more than double Apollo’s entire private equity portfolio -- says the transaction is a vote of confidence in New Media Chief Executive Officer Mike Reed and his track record in acquiring and managing media assets.
Yet that confidence comes at a steep price for the longtime news executive, who will take control of USA Today and major metro publications such as the Arizona Republic and Detroit Free Press once the Gannett acquisition closes.
The combined company will pay a 6.5% arranging fee for the five-year loan and an annual interest rate of 11.5%, according to regulatory filings. Apollo is expected to pocket the majority of the fee by funding the loan at a discount of 95 cents on the dollar, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the details are private.
A spokesman for New Media declined to comment. A spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the fee.
“The merger has a lot of industrial logic,” Zelter said. “We believe Mike and his team will make the right moves in terms of being thoughtful about digital strategy and the manner they will operate the business going forward.”
The loan to New Media is one of many investments Apollo has made in out-of-favor sectors in recent years. Its private equity arm has bought DVD kiosks, penny-counting machines and discount grocery stores. As with all high-risk businesses, there’s always the possibility that things won’t work out as planned.
Looking at the interest rate, “you have to assume there is a lot of risk there,” Howard Marks, co-chairman of distressed-debt manager Oaktree Capital Group LLC, said in Bloomberg TV interview Thursday. “I would be surprised to learn that it’s loan-to-own, but depending on how risky the proposition is I’m sure that not getting paid and instead ending up as an owner must factor into the picture.”

Split-bamboo fly rods are better than they’ve ever been.
I first heard this observation from rodmaker John Bradford, a man not known for hyperbole, and it’s hard to argue. Today’s craftsmen have more than 150 years’ worth of collective experience to draw on, plus the advantages of 21st century glues and varnishes. For once, tradition meets high tech with a happy outcome.
As the name implies, a split-bamboo rod is made from strips of bamboo, called “splines,” that are cut from a stalk, or “culm,” of bamboo. (The joints themselves are called nodes.) The strips are then tapered, using either a milling machine or, if you want it to take longer, a hand plane and an adjustable form. Afterward, the segments are glued together into a six-sided shaft.
This method was developed in the mid-1800s and gives a craftsman control over the rod’s taper, which determines the way the rod imparts energy to the fly line during the cast. And in fly-casting, that action is everything. Rodmakers work to tolerances of a few thousandths of an inch on each spline, and a few thousandths one way or the other can mean the difference between a magnificent casting instrument and a broomstick.
For the better part of a century, split bamboo was the benchmark for fly rods. In many cases, aficionados can trace an apostolic succession from one shop to the next as apprentices left to start their own companies. Think of Hiram Leonard, who began producing split-bamboo rods shortly after the Civil War. He taught Edward Payne, who then opened his own business, E.F. Payne Rod Co., where he passed on the craft to his son Jim, who then took over and continued to build bamboo rods until 1968. The lineage of others, such as F.E. Thomas, Goodwin Granger, Pinky Gillum, and Everett Garrison, can be followed in a similar way.
By the 1960s, bamboo’s popularity had faded with the advent of fiberglass and, later, graphite materials that are lighter, more durable, and easier to manufacture. But the obituaries for split bamboo were as premature as those for vinyl records.
Collectors homed in on the period from about 1920 to 1950, a stretch known as the “Golden Age,” and they began to sense a fortune in those classics that could still sometimes be found cheap at yard sales and flea markets as “old fishin’ poles.” Some of these rods can sell for $3,000 to $5,000. I’ve seen extremely rare ones priced at $10,000 or more. Meanwhile, those who continued to fish bamboo, as well as the craftsmen who made their rods, remained a small but vital fishing subculture.
When you consider the daunting amount of time and painstaking handwork that goes into a bamboo rod—South Creek Ltd.’s Mike Clark once told me it takes him 40 hours to make one, and he bangs them out as quickly as anyone I know—it’s not surprising that bamboo fly rods have become luxury items. Some rodmakers even find themselves in the ­awkward ­position of their wares becoming collectible while the craftsmen themselves are still alive and working.
Hoagy Carmichael, one of the authors of A Master’s Guide to Building a Bamboo Fly Rod, was annoyed when he saw his rods go straight from the shop into a glass case without ever being fished. Others took it in stride. When Michigan rodmaker Bob Summers learned a client had bought a rod at the going rate, only to turn around and sell it for ­considerably more to a collector, he shrugged and raised his prices.
The price tag is inevitably part of any discussion of bamboo fly rods, and often it’s the opening salvo. Fishermen usually ask me, “Why go to R.L. Winston, Thomas & Thomas, Tom Morgan Rodsmiths, or Tellico River Rods for bamboo costing thousands when I can get a serviceable graphite rod starting around $300 or $400?”
It’s a fair question with a vague answer. Part of it is the way we value the Yankee workshop-like tradition of fine handwork done with what we now consider to be primitive tools, as well as the antique virtues of skill and patience.
But there’s also some unapologetic nostalgia at work here. Bamboo fly rods can recall a time when life was simpler, fish bigger (and more numerous), and fishermen fewer and farther between. Or so we like to imagine.
For others, it’s the material itself. Bamboo is a species of grass—more like a reed than a piece of lumber—and it has a natural sensitivity that more modern ­materials lack. Bamboo fans say that their rods cast more fluidly, that their slight extra weight does more of the work, and that they’re better at cushioning light leaders. Where a graphite caster would talk about power and efficiency, one who uses bamboo might invoke terms such as “warmth” and “friendliness.”
There’s also the matter of uniqueness. Part of the character of every rod is imparted by the particular culm of bamboo from which it was made—its size, age, density, moisture content, whether or not it was heat-treated, and if so, how—so that even among identical rods by the same maker, there can be discernible differences. And bamboo rods, like violins, are said to evolve with use, so even if a rod doesn’t have a personality the first time you string it up, it will after you’ve fished with it for a few seasons.
Is this all beginning to sound a little mystical? Well, that’s how they get under your skin. The late rodmaker Charlie Jenkins once told me that half of what his ­customers were buying was the image of the lone craftsman in his workshop with his glasses pulled down on his nose, hand-making their rod. That sounds mostly right to me. Of course, Charlie was too modest to add that, in his case, the other half was one damned fine fly rod.
John Gierach is the author of more than 20 books about fly fishing, including A Fly Rod of Your Own, Standing in a River Waving a Stick, and the anthology Death, Taxes, and Leaky Waders. His next book, Dumb Luck and the Kindness of Strangers, will be available in April.

New Media Investment Group Inc. agreed to acquire Gannett Co. in a $1.38 billion deal that unites the two biggest U.S. daily newspaper chains in an industry that’s consolidating to survive.
The merged entity will be a local news giant that owns more than one-sixth of all daily newspapers in the country, including USA Today, and reaches nearly 9 million print readers, according to industry analyst Ken Doctor. All told, it will have 263 daily media outlets across 47 states.
The acquisition also sets the stage for further cutbacks in an industry already reeling from them. The companies said the deal will better allow them to provide marketing services to local businesses, deliver local journalism to communities and transition to a digital future. But they also said they anticipate about $300 million in cost savings each year from the transaction, which could lead to further cuts to news staffs. The combined company said it would invest in its newsrooms and search for cost reductions “in a judicious manner.”
New Media plans to pay cash and shares worth $12.06 a Gannett share, leaving Gannett holders with about 49.5% of the combined company. Gannett investors applauded the long-beleaguered company finding a buyer, sending shares up as much as 5.1%. New Media shareholders, meanwhile, were skeptical that the deal would pay off. Its stock lost as much as 8.6%.
The deal comes just months after Gannett fought off a hostile takeover bid by MNG Enterprises Inc., which is backed by the hedge fund Alden Global Capital. It also increases pressure on other local newspaper owners, such as Tribune Publishing Co., Lee Enterprises Inc. and McClatchy Co., to find deals of their own.
The newspaper industry has been in a downward spiral for years as the internet has upended its business model. Readers have moved online and get their news from social media, eroding print advertising sales. Much of the online ad market, meanwhile, is being gobbled up by Facebook and Google. And many newspapers have eroded their quality by ordering deep cuts to their newsrooms, making it increasingly difficult to persuade readers to pay for online subscriptions.
Newspaper executives see few options other than consolidation to cut even more costs, from sharing printing operations to eliminating local copy editors and designers. The number of newspaper newsroom employees dropped by 47% between 2008 and 2018, from about 71,000 workers to 38,000, according to Pew Research Center.
The deal further solidifies the power of private equity firms and hedge funds in the newspaper business. New Media is managed and controlled by private equity firm  Fortress Investment Group. Alden Global owns about 60 daily newspapers, including the Denver Post, through MNG, also known as Digital First Media. The hedge fund  Chatham Asset Management LLC is one of the largest shareholders and bondholders in McClatchy, publisher of the Charlotte Observer and Miami Herald.
After emerging from bankruptcy in 2013, New Media has been on a buying spree and now owns almost 150 newspapers in smaller cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Providence, Rhode Island. Like its peers, it has developed a reputation for cutting staff from its newsrooms.
In an  interview with Bloomberg News last year, New Media Chief Executive Officer  Michael Reed said the reporters who have been dismissed were highly paid but unproductive. The company is asking the remaining reporters to write more articles. The company has also eliminated local copy editors and designers and moved those jobs to a central hub in Austin, Texas, where it has hired more than 300 people.
Reed will retain the positions of chairman and CEO in the new business. Gannett’s newly appointed CEO, Paul Bascobert, will be CEO of the company’s operating subsidiary. Bascobert is a former president of Bloomberg Businessweek, which -- like Bloomberg News -- is a unit of Bloomberg LP.
The companies expect the merger to close by the end of the year. New Media and its subsidiary, GateHouse, will operate thereafter under the Gannett brand name.
Gannett shares were already up 25% this year before Monday’s rally, fueled by takeover speculation. New Media was down 11%.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris says she would fund her health-care plan by rolling back one of the few changes in President Donald Trump’s tax law that Democrats actually wanted.
The California senator wants to fund her version of “Medicare For All,” which she says would allow Americans to buy into a public-run option or keep their private insurance, by taxing domestic and offshore profits at the same rate.
That could face resistance within her own party, because it would unwind one of the few parts of the 2017 Republican tax law that Democrats helped develop, even as it may resonate with voters who want to see corporate America pay more taxes.
The tax overhaul passed without any Democratic votes and largely no input in the drafting. But prominent Democrats -- including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal -- had in the years before that pushed to make it easier for U.S. companies to operate globally, a change that Republicans ultimately included in their 2017 tax law.
The overhaul cut the corporate tax rate to 21% and moved toward a so-called “territorial system” under which companies pay the U.S. banner rate on domestic profits only. The law included a minimum tax so corporations operating in low or no-tax countries still pay some tax on their earnings.
Democrats say they would have backed a higher rate -- more like 28% -- but the underpinnings mirror a bipartisan international tax plan Schumer and Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, released in 2015. Democrats say they opposed the law because it cut taxes too much for corporations and the wealthy and didn’t do enough for middle-income earners.
“As the importance of success in foreign markets has grown, the United States has become less competitive abroad because of its worldwide system of international taxation,” Schumer and Portman wrote in their 2015 report. “No matter what jurisdiction a U.S. multinational company is competing in, it is competing at a disadvantage.”
Democrats say that Republicans didn’t implement their broad agreement in a way that upheld the spirit of their shared goals. Every proposal from the Obama administration and Republicans included moving toward a territorial system, but the two sides -- led by Portman and Schumer -- couldn’t broach differences over their base erosion measures, according to a Schumer spokesman. That’s the key distinction that determines whether you stop bad activity, like offshoring and tax evasion the spokesman said.
Schumer’s office referenced a letter Senate Democrats sent to Trump days before he signed the bill into law.
“The Republican tax bills, as drafted, will reward companies that offshored jobs with a large tax cut on old profits unavailable to companies that kept their production in the United States,” the Democrats’ letter said. “This disparity may actually encourage companies to move production and jobs overseas.”
Democrats and Republicans both expressed concern before the 2017 tax law was enacted that the outdated tax code made it difficult for U.S. companies to compete with their foreign competitors, and invited corporations to move their headquarters and jobs offshore. At the time, large American companies -- such as Burger King Worldwide Inc., Eaton Plc and Medtronic Plc -- were relocating their head offices abroad for tax reasons by doing deals known as corporate inversions.
“It feels like ancient history, even though it was only a few years ago. Every couple of weeks you would read about another company announcing they were inverting or shifting profits offshore,” said Jennifer Acuña, a former Senate Finance Committee tax aide who’s now at accounting firm KPMG. “Everyone agreed that was a bipartisan issue.”

Before the 2017 law, corporations paid a 35% tax rate on profits no matter where they were earned in what’s known as a “worldwide” tax system. However, companies could defer actually paying the tax on offshore earnings until they brought the cash back to the U.S..
Harris doesn’t specify if companies could defer the tax on the foreign profits under her proposal, or minimize their tax bills by applying foreign tax credits to the U.S. liability. But her plan to revert to worldwide taxation could give incentives for companies to resume corporate inversion deals, which largely stopped after the 2017 law, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.
“Worldwide taxation makes companies immensely sensitive to their headquarter location,” he said. “Though I’m not convinced that the new system got rid of the incentive. It’s still there but to a much smaller degree.”
Democrats and Republicans have criticized the tax law for not working as intended, so much so that Trump-appointed Treasury official Dana Trier was asked to resign after he publicly asked, “Do you think it’s a model of sophistication?”
Where Democrats are on taxes now is likely to be different to where they were in 2015, said Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. They’re realizing that they may have lost the 2017 tax battle, but are winning the messaging war, he said.
That’s caused presidential candidates, including Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden, to call for repealing the whole thing. Complaints that U.S. companies weren’t competitive before the tax law were overblown, said Kim Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. During the years leading up to tax reform, companies’ after-tax profits were substantially higher than they were in the 1980s and 1990s, she said.
“Most people don’t have a superfine, nuanced sense about international taxation and are susceptible to arguments that we have to compete with other countries,” she said. “People find it unfair that the U.S. will charge less for income in Bermuda than in U.S. People don’t like off-shoring or tax havens.”
For now, Congress is at a standstill on tax issues. Republicans want to make minor tweaks to their 2017 law, but Democrats won’t support changes unless there are also major revisions to cull the tax breaks for companies and wealthy individuals. Under the right president, Congress might be able to work together on taxes again, said Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat.
“The Finance Committee has a history of being bipartisan,” he said. “We’re gotten away from that, but I think we’re returning to our roots.”"

For the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, such attacks come with the territory. But brushing them off is getting harder in the age of social media. One online foe has so troubled the agency’s staff that it’s made the remarkable move of seeking to hire an expert to burnish their images.
The contractor’s duties will include monitoring content about employees in the SEC’s vaunted enforcement division on the web and removing anything that’s “false or harmful,” according to a July 22 posting on a federal job site.
Excerpt from SEC job posting.
The listing didn’t name the detractor, but the individual isn’t a well-known executive like Musk or Cuban, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. The SEC accused the mystery adversary of violating securities laws, and the individual started assailing agency officials online, while taking steps to ensure Google and other search engines picked up the critiques.
“In the course of protecting investors and enforcing our securities laws, individual SEC staff members can unfortunately become the target of personal attacks online, which are appropriate for us to counter vigorously,” said SEC spokesman John Nester.
The SEC’s request shows that even a feared financial regulator can struggle to quiet someone who’s bent on using sites like Twitter to damage reputations. While former SEC lawyers say they were routinely harassed by those they investigated, they can’t recall the agency previously seeking a consultant to perform this kind of work.
“It’s very unusual,” said John Reed Stark, who spent about 20 years in the SEC’s enforcement division and said he was often targeted. “I wish they had it back in the day. It would’ve given me some comfort.”
Stark said the threats he received never went beyond online posts, though he did on occasion contact federal authorities to determine whether certain individuals were more dangerous than others.
Before social media accounts became ubiquitous, most threats were confined to stock message boards, Stark said. Now many of the 1,300 officials in the enforcement unit have LinkedIn and Facebook accounts, making them easier targets for disgruntled fraudsters.
The reputation manager may work for the SEC for up to three years with the job description indicating that compensation won’t exceed $250,000, according to the agency’s request. It’s unclear from the contract if the consultant would just focus on quieting the unnamed critic or more broadly try to enhance the SEC’s reputation.
Doing so could prove controversial in the era of President Donald Trump. While he regularly calls articles he dislikes “fake news,” it would escalate things if an independent regulator sought to routinely suppress unfavorable content.
“The safety of employees and the integrity of the investigative process is important, but this proposal raises serious free speech issues,” said Chris Ullman, who now runs his own public relations firm after stints at Carlyle Group LP and leading the SEC’s public affairs office. “The proposal is so broad as to possibly infringe on the public’s ability to criticize the commission.”
The SEC has been rehabilitating its reputation over the last decade after failing to spot Bernie Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme and for missing warning signs of the 2008 financial crisis. The failures prompted policy makers to discuss dissolving the agency and giving its responsibilities to other regulators such as the Federal Reserve.
Since then, the SEC has brought a record number of cases and sought billions of dollars in penalties from alleged wrongdoers.
The most recent high-profile case came against Musk. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer was accused of violating securities laws when he tweeted last August that he was considering taking the automaker private. He settled the allegations weeks later only to go on “60 minutes” and declare that “I do not respect the SEC.”
Former hedge fund manager Cooperman initially fought SEC allegations in 2016 that he traded on inside information. He took to CNBC and Bloomberg Television to air his grievances, but then decided to settle the claims without admitting fault. Dallas Mavericks owner Cuban fought and won an SEC case against him in 2013 over claims that he also traded on inside information.

Mark Esper was confirmed by the Senate to be President Donald Trump’s new secretary of defense, ending a seven-month vacancy in the position as the U.S. navigates through key foreign policies crises with Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan.
Esper won overwhelming bipartisan support in the 90-8 vote on Tuesday. He was sworn in hours later at the White House.
Esper’s confirmation adds some stability to Trump’s national security team, which has lacked a Senate-confirmed leader at the Pentagon since Jim Mattis quit in December in response to the president’s announcement that he’d withdraw troops from Syria. Since then there have been two acting secretaries: Patrick Shanahan, who withdrew from consideration for the permanent job, and Navy Secretary Richard Spencer.
A 55-year-old West Point graduate, Esper was previously secretary of the Army and is a former top lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon Co. He had been serving as acting Pentagon chief following Shanahan’s departure.
The administration still lacks a confirmed ambassador to the United Nations and the Senate is considering the nominations to replace the current head and deputy head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the president’s top military advisers.
Esper steps into the top Pentagon job with a long list of crises on his plate. Tensions with Iran are soaring following a spate of attacks on cargo ships, the downing of an American drone and Tehran’s seizure of a British oil tanker. Turkey has begun receiving components of a Russian missile defense system that has prompted the U.S. to expel the NATO ally from the F-35 fighter jet program.
He will also be steering U.S. defense strategy as it shifts to confront China and Russia as the department’s main challenges. China, with the world’s second-largest economy, is making major investments in military capabilities to challenge America’s dominance in the Asia-Pacific while Russia is expanding its influence in the Middle East.
Esper will have to manage “an increasingly aggressive and successful Russia, increasing animus with China” and tensions among NATO members, particularly Turkey, said Paul Sullivan, an international security expert at the National Defense University. Esper will also be pressured to manage the department’s relationship with Trump, who “is hard on his staff,” Sullivan said. “It is difficult to judge how well this will go” but Esper needs to “carve out his own space very soon,” he added.
The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee this month said that it was a matter of urgency to get Esper’s nomination through.
Some Democrats expressed concern about whether Esper would stand up to the president. Saying that Trump’s “temperament and management skills are challenging,” Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island said Esper would need to be “willing and able to provide the president with your best policy advice even if the president disagrees.”
Among the Democratic senators voting against Esper’s confirmation were presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand.
Warren voiced opposition to Esper’s nomination after he declined to recuse himself, without exception, from all potential decisions involving Raytheon, the No. 3 defense contractor. United Technologies Corp. has agreed to buy Raytheon, forming an aerospace and defense giant with $74 billion in sales in one of the industry’s biggest transactions ever. Warren told Esper that his refusal to recuse himself in all circumstances “smacks of corruption.”
“Secretary Esper has real conflicts of interest with Raytheon that he is unwilling to remedy by taking simple, reasonable steps,” she said July 16 opposing his nomination. “Until he is willing to make these commitments, he should not be confirmed as the Secretary of Defense, and I oppose his nomination.”
Esper will receive $1 million to $5 million in deferred compensation from Raytheon starting in 2022, reflecting the broad ranges that officials must disclose for the value of their assets, according to his financial disclosure statement.
Esper and his team have repeatedly said he will follow his signed ethics agreement, all applicable laws and the president’s Ethics Pledge. He’s said any Raytheon issues will be screened before coming to his desk and will be referred whenever possible to another official. In a July 19 letter to Warren, he added that he’s agreed to recuse himself from issues involving the Raytheon-United Technologies merger “even if the law would allow me to participate in discussions or decisions” about the transaction.
Trump didn’t formally nominate Esper until the eve of last week’s hearing because a federal law required the nominee to step down from his position as acting secretary. That role was filled by Spencer, who is now expected to serve temporarily as the acting deputy secretary of defense. Trump on Tuesday said he’s nominating David Norquist for that post.

Wall Street’s heavyweights are prepping their clients for bad news: Some trades are about to get a lot more expensive.
Firms including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are warning customers to get ready for new rules that require more collateral for certain trades. The regulations take effect for some clients in September, but the snare gets even tighter in 2020, when more than 1,000 hedge funds, asset managers and insurers will get caught for the first time.
The so-called uncleared-margin rules require banks and their clients to “exchange margin” for derivatives traded directly between participants instead of being cleared through an exchange. Citigroup is sounding one of the loudest alarms about potential fallout, saying in a recent report that, for one model it tested, fees at its foreign-exchange prime brokerage got 31 times more expensive if it passed along higher costs.
“It’s going to be really tough,” said Audrey Blater, a senior analyst at researcher Aite Group. “People are dragging their feet and kicking and screaming that they actually have to do something. Up until now, a lot of buy-side firms weren’t touched by the regulation to the degree that a bank is, so they’re not used to doing stuff like this.”
The regulations will hit the currency market particularly hard, because some foreign-exchange products are rarely, if ever, cleared through an exchange. While those products could eventually move to an exchange, transaction costs and low liquidity have held back many traders from making the change so far.
In response to the regulations, Citigroup is proposing new fees for its prime-brokerage unit -- ones that would hit not only clients but also the brokers or banks they trade with, counterparties that until now had escaped such charges.
“All participants should share in these new costs,” Citigroup said in its report. Executing brokers “should pay their fair share.”
That idea has drawn mixed reviews. Some of Citigroup’s competitors say they won’t need to raise prices. Others, such as Societe Generale SA’s John O’Hara, say there’s no system in place to begin charging the executing banks, and those firms would pass the fee onto clients anyway.
“As far as charging the executing dealers, I don’t think that will get any traction,” O’Hara, head of prime brokerage and clearing in the Americas at Societe Generale, said in a telephone interview. Still, he acknowledged, “the costs of FXPB services are going to increase significantly.”
Just 20% of buy-side firms have begun to examine the impact the new rules will have on their trading costs, according to a June report from Greenwich Associates. Less than 40% of the firms would consider listed options for their currency trades when their firm becomes subject to the new margin rules, the study found.
“The only thing it can do is cause the cost of prime brokerage to me to go up,” said Michael O’Brien, director of global trading at Eaton Vance Corp. “I strongly believe that clearing is the primary solution for the uncleared margin rules when it comes to asset managers. There are a lot of complicated things to address, but I think you want to minimize the impact on the portfolio by minimizing the number of trades it impacts.”
Transaction fees and operational challenges were among the biggest obstacles to moving to a cleared model, based on responses to the Greenwich Associates study.
“Our analysis suggests these hurdles are diminishing quickly and, in some cases, may be more perceived than real,” David Stryker, a principal at Greenwich Associates, said in the June report, which also noted that shifting to listed foreign-exchange options could reduce costs by as much as 70% per trade.
September 2020 is the deadline for the fifth and final phase of the new regulations, requiring firms with more than $8 billion in exposure to derivatives to begin socking away more margin, a threshold that will vastly increase the number of hedge funds and asset managers that would have to comply with the rules.
While big banks have long had large special units dedicated to managing their margin, many hedge funds and asset managers have little experience in this area. Smaller buy-side firms had at least one win this month: The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled that firms below the $50 million margin threshold don’t have to undergo the legal-documentation process.
“Phase 5 will have a big impact on the market because more of the buy-side will come into scope then,” said Ilene Froom, a partner in the financial-industry group at law firm Reed Smith LLP. “The documentation relief from the CFTC will be a big help.”"

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating crypto exchange BitMEX, according to people familiar with the matter, a platform that’s become wildly popular in Asia for letting people make big bets with little money down.
The months-long CFTC probe is focused on whether BitMEX broke rules by allowing Americans to trade on the platform, which isn’t registered with the agency, said one of the people who asked not to be named discussing the investigation, which hasn’t been made public. The regulator considers virtual currencies like Bitcoin to be commodities, and it has jurisdiction over futures and other derivatives based on them.

The probe is ongoing and the regulator’s investigations often don’t lead to allegations of misconduct. The CFTC declined to comment.
“HDR Global Trading Limited, owner of BitMEX, as a matter of company policy, does not comment on any media reports about inquiries or investigations by government agencies or regulators and we have no comment on this report,” a BitMEX spokeswoman said.
BitMEX Chief Executive Officer Arthur Hayes said in an interview in January that BitMEX removes anyone who flouted company rules barring U.S. residents and nationals. However, it is possible clients masked their location by using virtual private networks to assign their computer an Internet protocol address from a BitMEX permitted country, tricking filters put in place, Hayes said.
A hodgepodge of U.S. agencies claim some jurisdiction over digital currencies and the CFTC’s turf is largely limited to crypto derivatives and fraud and manipulation in the spot market. Still, the main American swaps regulator has staked out a leading role overseeing virtual currencies and sued crypto firms for violating its derivatives regulations at home and abroad when U.S. clients are involved.
In March, Marshall Islands-based firm 1pool Ltd. agreed to pay almost $1 million to settle CFTC charges that it broke rules when offering contracts that used Bitcoin as collateral. In that case, the CFTC alleged that the firm illegally offered retail commodity transactions that were margined in the virtual currency with U.S. customers and improperly acted as a broker for them by accepting Bitcoin as collateral.
While BitMEX is registered in the Seychelles, its main office is in Hong Kong, and it also has an office in San Francisco.
Hayes, one of the firm’s three co-founders, is a former Citigroup Inc. equities trader and a well-known presence at crypto conferences around the globe. Samuel Reed, another co-founder, has a background in programming. The third, Ben Delo, previously worked as a vice president at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Hong Kong, according to his LinkedIn bio. At JPMorgan, Delo developed high-frequency trading systems.
Read a Bloomberg News profile of Arthur Hayes.
The CFTC’s probe of BitMEX comes as authorities around the world step up scrutiny of a largely unregulated crypto market that’s been beset by scams, accusations of price manipulation and a collapse in value of many heavily traded tokens. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter July 11 that “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”
Rules around cryptocurrency trading vary greatly by country and BitMEX has posted a notice on its website that people who are citizens or residents of the U.S. or the Canadian province of Quebec are prohibited from using the platform under its terms of service. Some traders have taken to social media to complain about being booted from BitMEX on suspicion of being from the U.S.
Founded in January 2014, BitMEX is regularly among the top exchanges by reported volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Its early selling point was a referral system which gave a portion of trading fees to clients who introduced new traders to the platform. BitMEX also offers contracts similar to futures that let investors make leveraged bets of up to 100 to 1 on the direction of various digital currencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The firm has faced criticism, including from New York University economist Nouriel Roubini. And the broader industry has faced some potential setbacks; earlier this month, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority proposed a ban on retail sales of crypto derivative products, warning consumers that digital tokens had no reliable basis for valuation.
“People love to speculate, we’re trying to give them an opportunity to do it in a safe manner,” Hayes said at a conference in Taipei earlier in July. “At the end of the day, we’re all in the entertainment business of traders.”

Netflix Inc.’s biggest earnings surprise in years sent the shares plummeting the day after results were released, leaving analysts and investors wondering why they were caught so off guard.
When some companies know that their quarterly results are going to fall short of forecasts, they put out a pre-announcement or update their guidance. But not Netflix.
Instead, the company dropped a bombshell with no warning: Its customer growth was roughly half what it projected, and Netflix actually lost U.S. subscribers during the period. That hasn’t happened since 2011, when the company made a disastrous attempt to split up its streaming and DVD-by-mail operations.
The fallout on Thursday included the worst stock rout in three years, with the stock declining 10% to erase more than $16 billion in market value. Shares in Netflix extended those declines on Friday, falling 3.1% to $315.10 per share, their lowest since January. The stock has fallen for seven consecutive sessions, the longest losing streak in nearly four years.

“You would think Netflix would want to update guidance or give a pre-annoucement, as I’m sure they definitely knew about this for a while,” said Nick Licouris, an investment adviser at Gerber Kawasaki. “But they probably didn’t want to do it because they were going to take a hit at that time or during earnings -- especially since subscriber numbers are the No. 1 thing analysts look at -- and in earnings you can spin it better than a stand-alone announcement.”
Another reason not to issue a warning: The company met most of Wall Street’s financial estimates, such as sales and profit. It was only the subscriber numbers that really came up short.
“Revenue was very close to guidance and profits were actually above, so I’d guess they didn’t think it was necessary to pre-announce a weak sub number when other financial metrics were fine,” said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
There’s also been a broader shift away from giving earnings warnings, said Huber Research Partners founder Craig Huber.
“I have noticed companies in media and internet that I follow do not seem to pre-announce pending negative results with the same regularity as years ago,” he said.
Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, didn’t have an immediate comment.
The streaming giant’s tight-lipped culture extends beyond earnings. Unlike traditional media companies, it’s very selective about the viewer information it provides. Third parties try to fill the gaps by providing their own data on Netflix’s audience, but that can prove to be unreliable.
Those kinds of data services failed to predict the latest shortfall, Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker said in a note.
“For several days,” she said, “investors told us ‘such-and-such data service suggests domestic adds will come in line; while international might be somewhat soft.’ Wrong. I mean -- right in the sense that international was soft but totally wrong on the domestic subs part.”
Netflix remains the dominant paid video streaming service, with its sights set on international expansion to counter slowing growth at home. But rising competition abroad -- such as a U.K. streaming venture announced Friday between ITV Plc and the BBC -- could challenge that growth as well.
Netflix also delivers its earnings in an idiosyncratic way. Instead of doing a traditional Q&A conference call, the company releases an “earnings interview” on YouTube with a single analyst. It also issues its reports on its website, not through the paid services that many companies use to disseminate information.
Though this week’s stock rout was especially severe, it’s common for Netflix’s earnings to spark a huge share move. The average change on the day after quarterly reports is almost 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Compare that with Apple Inc., where it’s 4.4%. Or Microsoft Corp., where it’s 4.1%.

There’s another explanation for the huge swings in Netflix’s stock: overreaction. That was the message from Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings this week. It’s easy to “overinterpret” subscriber figures, he said.
“Sometimes we are forecast high, sometimes we forecast low,” he said. “We’re just executing forward and trying to do the best forecast we can.”

Netflix Inc., whose shares plunged after it reported the worst drop in U.S. users since 2011, is looking for new subscriber growth in India, a rapidly expanding streaming market. Trouble is, so are a raft of ambitious local players with cut-rate programming packages.
Already wrestling with global giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Amazon.com Inc., Netflix now also contends with broadcasters and Bollywood powerhouses allied with billionaire-backed wireless carriers, who are luring users with free offers or as low as 40 cents a month. That tactic has put them directly in the India growth path of the world’s largest paid online streaming service.
The intense competition could derail Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’s goal of 100 million customers in India -- almost 25 times Netflix’s estimated subscriber base there this year. The world’s second-most populous country is a priority for the streaming service, which is effectively blocked in China. The second-quarter loss of 130,000 users in the U.S., reported Wednesday, makes winning in India all the more pressing.
Netflix shares fell 10%, the most in three years, to close at $325.21 in New York trading Thursday. That knocked about $16.3 billion off its market value.
With a growing number of smartphones and a surge in the use of broadband, India has become a battleground for streaming services. Cisco Systems Inc. has estimated the country will have 829 million smartphone users by 2022, from a projected half a billion this year.
“We are seeing a nice, steady increase in engagement with Indian viewers that we think we can build on,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “Growth in that country is a marathon. We’re in it for the long haul.”
India’s video-on-demand market could grow to $5 billion by 2023 from $500 million last year, estimates researcher Boston Consulting Group. Paying subscribers will probably rise to as many as 50 million, while users of advertising-supported video-on-demand will reach 600 million, BCG predicts.
Netflix has amassed more than 150 million subscribers worldwide, giving it the largest paid customer base. The U.S., Brazil and Canada are three of its largest markets, while Australia is the company’s biggest success story in the Asia-Pacific region. India differs from most of these markets, however, in its population’s sensitivity to price.
The Los Gatos, California-based firm has responded to competition in India by offering a mobile-only service at less than half the typical subscription price, and by raising spending on local content faster than in any other market.
While it’s still lagging behind Amazon Prime and Disney’s Hotstar, the price cuts are helping it outpace the growth of its biggest rivals, while raising questions about sustainability and margins. Hotstar built its base by streaming cricket matches that are wildly popular in the former British colony.
Netflix will probably almost triple subscribers in India this year to 4.1 million, within striking distance of Amazon Prime’s 4.4 million, according to estimates by researcher IHS Markit. That’s faster than Amazon or Hotstar Premium, two of Netflix’s biggest competitors. Some other estimates put Netflix’s base in India at between 1 million and 2 million. The company doesn’t provide data for individual markets.
“Netflix is in a land grab to capture as many subscribers as possible, whatever the price,” said Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc. “The less they charge, the more cash they are likely to burn.”

The company spooked investors Wednesday with a report that it lost subscribers in the U.S. and signed up only 2.8 million internationally in the three months ended June, roughly half its own prediction.
It also reported its 20th quarter of negative free cash flow as it spends on adding content and replacing series and films being pulled from its platforms by competitors like Disney.
While Netflix is speeding up its investment, Indian rivals including Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and Balaji Telefilms Ltd. are betting on bundling their content with mobile phone services. The TV network and Bollywood producer are allying with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio wireless service and Bharti Airtel Ltd., two of the country’s three biggest carriers, to offer decades of content to subscribers.
Zee, parent of the country’s largest private broadcast network, offers movies, exclusive TV content and more than 90 live channels on its ZEE5 platform with content across 12 languages for as little as 70 cents a month. Partial access to the platform is free to subscribers of mobile phone carrier Bharti Airtel, controlled by billionaire Sunil Mittal. Users of Airtel’s plans priced at $7.25-a-month or more get full access to ZEE5 free.
Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which elbowed its way into the country’s mobile phone business three years ago with free calling and low-priced data services, has jumped into film and TV streaming, including a tie-up with Balaji Telefilms.
Sunil Lulla, chief executive officer of Balaji Telefilms, said the company’s service ALTBalaji is focused on producing exclusive content in Hindi, the country’s most-used language.
Other local entrants in India’s  OTT, or “over-the-top,” market include Disney’s Hulu, Sony Corp.’s Sony LIV, Network 18 Media & Investments Ltd.’s Voot and Bollywood filmmaker Eros International Plc.’s Eros Now.

Netflix’s global rival Amazon is also counting on India for growth and is prepared to take time to draw users.
“We have a very long-term view for India, with a billion film-crazy people,” said Gaurav Gandhi, director and head of business for Amazon Prime Video, India. “In the next four to five years, there will be more screens connected to the internet and we are looking at distributing across all platforms with personalized and quality video content at affordable prices.”
Pricing will also be crucial for Netflix. After introducing a promotional offer of about $3.65 a month for mobile-only users, Netflix decided to make the lower price permanent as “an opportunity to broaden access to the service,” Greg Peters, chief product officer, said Wednesday.
“Pricing is going to be the biggest challenge,” said Hanish Bhatia, senior analyst at Counterpoint. “Indian users have not accepted the idea of paying for content yet. Two to three years back, everybody relied on torrent,” the free protocol that lets users share and download films and TV shows without paying for them, Bhatia said.

Netflix didn’t disclose how much it’s spending on local content in India. It did announce the addition of five series, two of which are being produced by superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma.
“Netflix wants to have one big original, almost like a new Bollywood movie, coming out every month,” said Mihir Shah, vice president (India) at Media Partners Asia, a consulting firm. “In India, people pay for Bollywood. Netflix is hoping that if people are willing to pay $10 to watch a movie together as a family, they will also subscribe.”"

Mark Esper, President Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, must do more “to clear any ethics cloud” from his seven years as Raytheon Co.’s top lobbyist, according to Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Warren, a Democratic presidential contender and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee that will hold a confirmation hearing with Esper on Tuesday, set out her concerns in a four-page letter obtained by Bloomberg News. While offering some praise for the Army secretary who has been serving as acting defense chief, Warren said a “cordial” meeting last week proved disappointing.
Mark Esper
“I am extremely disappointed by your unwillingness to commit to take the steps needed to clear any ethics cloud related to your former lobbying work for Raytheon,” Warren wrote. “If confirmed as defense secretary, your potential conflicts would raise significant questions about whether the Department of Defense’s contracting decisions would favor Raytheon.”
She said “you refused to commit to extend” a two-year period for recusal from “participating personally and substantially” in “any particular matter involving Raytheon” that will expire in November.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement that Esper has assured Warren “that he is fully committed to following his signed Ethics Agreement, all applicable ethics laws, and the President’s Ethics Pledge.” He added that Esper will “ensure that any particular matter involving his former employer is screened and referred to another appropriate official.” The Pentagon will be responding directly to Warren soon, Hoffman said.
Jim Inhofe, left, and Jack Reed
The leaders of the Senate panel that will vote on Esper’s nomination -- Republican Chairman Jim Inhofe and top Democrat Jack Reed -- have indicated they are determined to expedite Esper’s confirmation for the No. 1 job at the Pentagon, which hasn’t had a confirmed chief since Jim Mattis stepped down in December over disagreements with Trump’s Syria policy and his “America First” downgrading of alliances. 
“We need Senate-confirmed leadership at the Pentagon, and quickly,” Inhofe and Reed said in a joint statement last week.
In an interview before Warren’s letter was made public, Inhofe said “not one person” on the committee, Republican or Democrat, raised concerns with him about Esper’s connections to Raytheon.
Warren could assert a senator’s traditional prerogative to put a “hold” on the nomination, which would block action at least temporarily, but she didn’t threaten to do so in her letter.
Raytheon was the third-biggest U.S. defense contractor in fiscal 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Government. It’s reached a deal to be acquired by United Technologies Corp., the sixth-biggest. That would expand the range of potential conflicts Esper may confront if he’s confirmed as defense secretary.

Esper will receive $1 million to $5 million in deferred compensation from Raytheon starting in 2022, reflecting the broad ranges that officials must disclose for the value of their assets, according to his financial disclosure statement.
Elizabeth Warren
Warren said in the letter that Esper appears not to have participated in decisions involving Raytheon, in keeping with a 2017 ethics agreement for his post as Army secretary. She said that “if confirmed you must continue not to be involved with any matters that would affect Raytheon’s or your own financial interests.”
Earlier: Pentagon’s Esper May Get Expanded Waivers From Raytheon Recusals
The Massachusetts senator said Esper should take five additional steps, such as recusing himself from “participating in all decisions -- including but not limited to policy, budget, contracting and strategy discussions -- involving Raytheon” or any companies that are competing directly against the Waltham, Massachusetts-based contractor “for any DoD contract.”
Esper, 55, outlined in a June 24 “screening agreement” steps for his staff to head off potential conflicts while also citing some potential exceptions from the recusal pledge that would reflect his move to the top of Pentagon decision-making.
Aides said the exceptions cited in the memo, reported last week by Bloomberg News, were fully allowed under ethics law and were similar to those in a screening arrangement for former Boeing Co. executive Patrick Shanahan, who served as acting defense secretary until withdrawing last month.
Among the possibilities Esper cited was that he may be given a waiver if a designated department official and an ethics officer agree that his participation in a matter that may directly affect Raytheon’s financial interests is “so important that it cannot be referred to another official.”
Warren countered in her letter that Esper’s recusal commitment was too limited and should encompass all decisions that could affect Raytheon, not simply those that affect its ability to pay his deferred compensation. She wants Esper to “clarify and amend” the screening memo “to ensure it does not weaken or create loopholes for your recusal commitments.”
The memo, if left unchanged, “would appear to allow you to participate in decisions that affect Raytheon’s financial standing and should disqualify you from serving as Secretary of Defense, even in an acting capacity,” she wrote.
Esper’s updated Ethics Agreement could be finalized by the independent Office of Government Ethics and submitted to the Senate panel by Tuesday, according to a Pentagon official who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public."

The Army secretary and former Raytheon Co. lobbyist has been acting secretary at the Pentagon, which hasn’t had a confirmed chief since December.
Flagging concerns about turmoil at the top of the Defense Department, committee Chairman Jim Inhofe and top Democrat Jack Reed said Thursday that they’ve already received pre-nomination paperwork from the Trump administration allowing them to get started on vetting Esper for the job.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stepped down in December over disagreements with President Donald Trump’s Syria policy. Mattis’s deputy, Patrick Shanahan, became acting secretary but withdrew from contention for the permanent post last month after allegations of domestic violence in his family emerged.
“We need Senate-confirmed leadership at the Pentagon, and quickly,” Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, said in a joint statement with Reed of Rhode Island on Thursday. During a hearing earlier in the day, Reed said he was “concerned that the constant turnover of senior civilian leadership within the department has created uncertainty and disarray. ”
Inhofe told reporters on Thursday that a vote in the full Senate to confirm Esper could come before the chamber’s August break.
While both Inhofe and Reed emphasized that they will move quickly to consider Esper’s nomination, the circumstances around Shanahan’s aborted consideration for defense secretary means there will be hard questions about whether sufficient vetting has been done. The allegations that derailed Shanahan’s expected nomination for the top job weren’t raised during his 2017 confirmation to be Mattis’s deputy.
Under the federal Vacancies Act, Esper, 55, must step down as acting secretary once his nomination is formally sent to the Senate by the White House. He’ll be replaced on a temporary basis by Navy Secretary Richard Spencer until his confirmation.

Consumers' most common complaint about taste? ""Too sweet.""

Americans tend to associate our health problems with sin. It’s hard to find a health story in the press that doesn’t blame greed and lack of willpower for our ongoing epidemics of obesity and diabetes as well as a recent upturn in the rate of heart disease. But the problems stem more from a greedy food industry than from any weakness in consumers. Our supermarket shelves are filled with items made with cheap ingredients, especially sugar and corn syrup, whether people want it or not.
A fascinating new study out of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia showed that among 400,000 food reviews on Amazon.com, the primary complaint was that food was too sweet. People used terms like “syrupy, overwhelmingly or cloyingly sweet,” said behavioral geneticist Danielle Reed, who led the research. She and her colleagues used a machine- learning program to sort through the thousands of reviews covering 67,553 products.
The finding was a surprise; she had designed the study to add to her body of work on the way people vary in the perception of bitterness. Genetic differences make some people much more sensitive to bitter tastes than others, and this can affect whether we love or hate vegetables such as broccoli and kale. She was surprised, she said, that on Amazon reviews, consumers rarely complained about bitterness, or saltiness for that matter. They complained about sweetness. Manufacturers may think they are sweetening things to suit a common taste, in which case they are getting it wrong – but the market is full of oversweetened foods, so the manufacturers mostly don’t lose customers to better-tasting competitors.
Or the problem may be that manufacturers are trying to use the cheapest possible ingredients in a way that consumers will still tolerate. Sugar is cheap, and corn syrup even cheaper. In his book “The Omnivore’s Dilemma,” author Michael Pollan recounts the way the introduction of corn syrup in the late 20th century tempted manufacturers add as much as possible to many processed foods and to lure consumers with giant sodas and other supersized products that felt like bargains but came with hidden costs. Later, the medical dogma that fat was deadly led to an explosion of extremely sweet low-fat products as well.
However we got here, it’s clear that the empty calories are contributing to epidemics of obesity in the U.S. and elsewhere. The food police should rethink chastising consumers and turn their attention on the true culprits who are dishing it out.

299,,,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-10/u-s-wind-farms-have-trouble-connecting-to-cities,"July 10, 2019, 7:00 AM EDT",Guess What’s Holding Back Wind Power in the U.S.,"One man’s failed attempt to build a transmission line illustrates a unique American obstacle to clean energy.
One man’s failed attempt to build a transmission line illustrates a unique American obstacle to clean energy.
Wind power is rural.
The cost of wind energy has dropped drastically over the past several decades as the technology has advanced, especially in the size of turbines. Since 2009, the unsubsidized average cost of onshore wind-energy production has fallen to 4.2 cents per kilowatt hour, from 13.5 cents in 2018, according to an analysis by Lazard, the company I work for. After including U.S. tax subsidies, the cost of building wind capacity is often lower than the marginal cost of generating electricity with existing coal-powered plants. Thus wind energy now offers great opportunities for lowering carbon-dioxide emissions.
But a surprisingly difficult challenge remains: how to move the wind energy from the places where it is produced — often remote areas — to the population centers where it is needed. One reason wind accounts for a greater share of energy produced in Europe — it represents 12% of electricity in Germany and 19% in Spain, compared with just 7% in the U.S. — is not that more wind blows there. It’s partly that European infrastructure facilitates transmission of the power to the places where people live.
One big reason the U.S. lags in such transmission is dramatically illustrated by the experience of Michael Skelly, who was a founder of one of America’s largest wind-power companies, and is now an adviser at Lazard. Beginning almost a decade ago, Skelly tried to construct a 700-mile high-voltage direct-current line to carry wind energy from the Oklahoma panhandle to Tennessee. In the end, he was stymied by opposition from property owners and government officials who refused to allow the line to cross their land. As Wall Street Journal reporter Russell Gold tells the story in his new book, “Superpower: One Man’s Quest to Transform American Energy,” Skelly worked tirelessly to navigate the difficult local politics.
The underlying policy issue here involves eminent domain, the power that governments use to force local property owners to seal easements across their land for some broader public purpose. Unlike interstate natural gas pipelines, which have been able to exercise eminent domain under federal law since Congress passed the Natural Gas Act in 1938, interstate electricity-distribution lines lack any such authority. In virtually every jurisdiction along the path of Skelly’s proposed wind-energy line, he faced substantial local opposition.
This problem theoretically could have been prevented. Back in 2008, President-elect Barack Obama’s transition team, of which I was part, discussed the idea of adding federal eminent domain for electricity lines to the economic stimulus bill. Obama rejected the idea because it was controversial enough to endanger the urgent stimulus package. In so doing, the former president lost a crucial opportunity to transform the electricity industry, argues Reed Hundt, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, in another recent book, “A Crisis Wasted.” It’s true that if Obama had tried and succeeded, Skelly’s story would have turned out differently. Yet Skelly’s experience also confirms that the politics of this issue are heated enough to have posed a threat to the stimulus bill itself.
So what now? Other efforts are being made to build lines in the same way Skelly tried, proceeding on the theory that, as Gold puts it, the “second mouse gets the cheese.” Two other approaches might get around the local difficulties detailed in “Superpower”: developing offshore wind farms near population centers (with underwater transmission lines), and laying high-voltage lines along existing highways or railroad lines.
Another way to substantially alter the trajectory of wind energy in the U.S. is to attach a price to carbon-dioxide emissions, so that wind energy becomes more cost-effective even in less windy areas, thereby making the transmission problem less severe. Many approaches to such pricing are possible. And although political obstacles make Congress unlikely to adopt any of them in the foreseeable future, some state governments aren’t waiting. Today 11 states, accounting for about a quarter of the U.S. population, have carbon pricing policies in place.
“Superpower” concludes on a somewhat discouraging note. But if turbine technology continues to advance, new ways are found to move wind energy to population centers, and states are able to set a price on carbon, Skelly’s story may one day be seen as merely a hiccup in the greater rise of wind power in the U.S.

Time To Move, the Swatch Group press event held May 14 to 16 in Switzerland, was something of an experiment. When the group decided to pull out of this year's Baselworld, it had to make other arrangements for 17 of its brands to show their new watches to clients and the press. 
Management decided that the group's six most expensive brands would meet commercial clients during Baselworld at the headquarters of the Hayek Group in downtown Zürich. (The Hayek Group is a private consulting company owned by the Hayek family, the Swatch Group's largest shareholder.) The other brands would meet with clients in local markets. 
As for the press, the six prestige brands decided to invite 200 journalists to Switzerland in May for meetings at the brand's production facilities. ""We are trying to change the concept,"" Blancpain CEO Marc Hayek, said. ""We want to present the novelties in the place where they are created and born."" The goal was to show not just watches the brands make, but where and how they make them. 
So it was that for three days, 200 reporters from 21 countries, separated into small groups by language, traveled around Switzerland's watchmaking region in vans, visiting six brands in six towns. 
Among them were our own Stephen Pulvirent and myself. Stephen reported on the new products; I focused on the factory visits. There we got a crash course on the Swiss system of mechanical watchmaking, essentially a T Tour (T for Terminaison, French for ""finishing""). That's trade terminology for the five stages of watch production, from T0 (the making of movement parts) to T4 (packing and shipping). 
What follows are one reporter's notes on the Swatch Group's whirlwind watch manufacture tour. 
On Day 1, bright and early, our group of 14 reporters from the U.S. and Australia piled into a van for the trip from our hotel in Lausanne up to Switzerland's legendary Vallée de Joux. The valley is nestled in the Jura Mountains that form the western border of Switzerland and France. The hour-long ride takes us up steep winding roads to the Col du Mollendruz, 3,871 feet above sea level, one of two mountain passes that lead to the Vallée below. First stop is the village of Le Sentier, home to the Blancpain manufacture. 
More than 700 people work here, in every phase of watchmaking, from watch and caliber design to movement manufacturing, casing, testing, and after-sales service. (Blancpain sells 30,000 watches a year, we are told.)
Today we'll get a glimpse of movement manufacturing. Our hosts issue us white lab coats, embossed with our names, and off we go. In the basement is the first stage of watch production, T0: the production of movement components, first by machine, then by hand. We're led into a storage room holding the raw materials – brass sheets and steel bars. From the next room comes a loud, rhythmic pounding sound. That's the Atelier Decoupage. We enter and see Essa machines pounding out brass mainplates, 100 pieces per minute. 
We move to the toolmaking workshop. There is a separate tool to cut each component in a watch movement, we are told. ""If there are 300 components in a movement, you need 300 tools,"" our guide says. Blancpain makes almost all its cutting tools itself. 
We move to the Usinage (Machining) section, containing a series of MTR 312 cutting machines that resemble NASA lunar modules. In the machines are 18 to 36 spindles programmed to mill, tap and drill brass components with a precision of 1 to 2 microns. 
Then to Tournage (Turning), a workshop that fabricates gold oscillating weights for self-winding movements. All Blancpain rotors are made of gold, except one: Ladybird watches have platinum rotors, also made here. Next is the Ebauches section, where machines make plates, bridges, springs, levers and other steel components.
In the next workshop, Lavage (Washing), every component is cleaned ultrasonically in hot baths containing natural detergents. Finally, each component goes to a decoration workshop, elsewhere in the Vallée de Joux, where it is decorated and washed again. That completes T0.   
The components then go upstairs to T1, and so do we. T1 is the stage where the components are assembled by watchmakers into complete movements. For these workshops, we must put blue plastic booties over our shoes so that we don't track dirt or dust into the ateliers. 
Here men and women wearing white lab coats, with loupes fixed by a wire around their heads, do pre-assembly of the mainplate, bridges and crown. They use electronic screwdrivers that exert exact pressure on the screws, and eight different oils for lubrication. Then, by hand, they assemble barrels, fix pallets and silicon hairsprings to escapements, and perform all the operations to create complete calibers. 
Every complete movement is tested and adjusted here and then sent to T2, watch assembly, done elsewhere in this building. We, however, head to Blancpain's high complication workshops in the nearby village of Le Brassus. There to greet us, wearing a white lab coat, is Blancpain CEO Marc Hayek.  
""The Farm,"" as Blancpain calls the factory, is a series of small ateliers in what was originally a mill located next to a stream on a hill above Le Brassus. Here master watchmakers make Blancpain's highest complications: minute repeaters, split-second chronographs, tourbillons, carrousels, and complex calendars. Outside one atelier is an amazing display that dramatizes what goes on here: it shows each one of the 740 parts in Blancpain's 1735 Grande Complication watch of 1991, at the time the most complicated automatic wristwatch ever made. 
Here, too, are ateliers devoted to decorating and engraving movement components and dials. We move from atelier to atelier, for the new product presentations by Blancpain executives, including Hayek himself, who presents the new Fifty Fathom watches.
 
In the afternoon, we ride down the road to Manufacture Breguet, in L'Orient, the village next to Le Brassus. We are welcomed by Thierry Esslinger, CEO of Montres Breguet, and Emmanuel Breguet, vice president/head of patrimony & marketing. They pay tribute to two extraordinary watch entrepreneurs. 
Emmanuel Breguet (right), head of patrimony and marketing at Montres Breguet,  showing the author the new Classique Tourbillon Extra-Plat Squelette watch.
This first is Emmanuel Breguet's ancestor, Neuchâtel-born Abraham-Louis Breguet, the genius Swiss watchmaker (and inventor of the tourbillon, patented in 1801) who opened a watch shop in Paris in 1775. The other is Nicolas G. Hayek, Sr., the Swatch Group chairman whose acquisition of the Breguet firm in 1999 revived the company, and who served as its CEO until his death in 2010. 
As we soon see, the spirit of both men inhabits this place.  Our first stop is the Restoration Department. ""This is where Abraham-Louis's DNA lies,"" our guide says. In this atelier, master watchmakers restore Breguet watches going back to the founder's time. We see one watchmaker working on a movement from 1810. Each year, about 20 vintage Breguets are restored here.
We're also shown the Breguet No. 1160 watch, an exact replica of Breguet's celebrated No. 160, the ""Marie Antoinette"" watch, which stood for a century as the world's most complicated watch. It was stolen from a Jerusalem museum in 1983 and later recovered. While it was still missing, Hayek Sr. decided to recreate it. ""It was a challenge that Nicolas Hayek wanted his house, his baby, to take on,"" our guide tell us. It was unveiled in 2008. 
The restoration department is in a landmark building that was for a century the Lemania factory. Nouvelle Lemania, as it became known, was part of the Breguet Group when the Swatch Group acquired it. It made movements for Breguet and third-party clients, most famously for Omega's Speedmaster. Hayek Sr. restored the Nouvelle Lemania building. Then, in 2001, he expanded and upgraded the facility in the first of three major expansions, changing the name to Manufacture Breguet in 2004. 
We leave the original Lemania building along a corridor leading to the modern three-story extension. On the way, we come upon a marker set into the floor, engraved as follows:  LA 1ere PIERRE A ETE POSEE / LE 28 09 2001 / PAR Monsieur NICOLAS G. HAYEK & SON FILS NICK (""The first cornerstone was laid on Sept. 28, 2001 by Mr. Nicolas G. Hayek and his son Nick."") Buried under the cornerstone is a time capsule containing a VHS video cassette with a message from Hayek to the future. And a video cassette player to play it on, in the event there aren't any around in the future! There are also newspapers from that time, with articles about Hayek's revival of the Breguet company.
Breguet employs 800 people in the Vallée de Joux, most of them here. We quickly pass by the T0 machine-manufacturing operations on the ground floor. T0 continues on the top floor, with components hand-finished by artisans. 
To me, the most striking section was Guillochage, where literally dozens of artisans sit operating engine-turning machines. Also called rose engines, the machines engrave dials with intricate patterns of intersecting lines. Abraham-Louis loved the look of guilloché, and employed it extensively on his thin-cased pocket watches that revolutionized watch design. He was the first to use guilloché on dials, we learn, and liked the way diamond-shaped patterns reflected light. At Manufacture Breguet, there are 35 rose engine machines. 
T2, assembly of the watch (fitting of the dial and hands; casing; complications assembly) takes place on level 1, the middle floor. Since Breguet was the inventor of the tourbillon, we get a short class on tourbillons, and learn that the company has six different types of tourbillon cages. 
 
The next morning, we head north from Lausanne, past large Lake Neuchatel and smaller Lake Bienne, into the town of Biel/Bienne (the German and French versions of the town's name; it has been officially known by both since 2005) to Omega's brand-new factory, which opened in 2017. There, CEO Reynald Aeschlimann, in his opening remarks, says that this is ""a great time for Omega."" 
The new, state-of-the-art factory, opened in 2017, is a symbol of a resurgent Omega. It is Switzerland's clear number two watch company, in terms of annual revenue (after Rolex), with sales estimated by Ventobel Equity Research at $2.26 billion wholesale for 2018. Two big anniversaries this year are sure to boost those sales: the 125th anniversary of the creation of the Omega brand and the  50th anniversary of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, when Omega became the first watch worn on the moon. 
There has been an Omega factory on this spot for 137 years, and Aeschlimann is proud to show off the gee-whiz wonders of the new plant. The five-story building was designed by Pritzker-prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban, built with concrete, glass and Swiss spruce.
Here we see industrial, not artisanal, production. Omega produces 3,000 watches a day, Aeschlimann tells us. Which means Omega produces in two weeks  what Blancpain does in a year. All of Omega's manufacturing is now under one roof: T2 (assembling the watch head and casing), T3 (bracelet assembly), and T4 (packaging and shipping). (Movement making, T1, is done elsewhere at ETA factories.) Also here is Omega's METAS testing center for Master Chronometer certification.
A highlight of the factory is its fully automated storage system, which delivers components to the workshops without human intervention. Located in a three-story, fireproof, 3,660 cubic foot space in the center of the building, the storage area holds more than 30,000 boxes containing all the parts necessary for T2 and T3. 
A system of four robotic arms -- our guide, Mariano Samudio, calls them John, Paul, George, and Ringo – and two vertical lifts, moving at breath-taking speed (4 meters per second) fetch the boxes and deliver them along 500 meters of conveyors. They perform 1,400 operations per hour, which visitors can observe through windows on the ground floor, or from above, through a window in the floor on level 4.
Once the components get to the workshops, however, the watch head is created the old-fashioned way, by hand. Ninety percent of the work of casing the movement, placing the dial, setting the hands, adjusting the stem, and so on, is done by hand. 
Unlike in the Vallée de Joux ateliers, we don't go into Omega's workshop, but view what goes on through glass dividers. To keep dust out, Omega does not allow any paper – or visitors – in the workshops. All communication there is done via touch-screen tablets. 
 
After lunch, we ride back up into the Jura Mountains, to La Chaux-de-Fonds, the self-described ""metropole horlogère"" (watchmaking metropolis), population 40,000, that has been a watchmaking town for 300 years. We drive along Rue Louis-Joseph Chevrolet. (Yep, that Chevrolet: the car pioneer was born here. So was renowned architect Le Corbusier.) We turn onto Allée du Tourbillon and arrive at Montres Jaquet Droz. 
Jaquet Droz, which the Swatch Group acquired the year after Montres Breguet, is named for a local watchmaking wizard. Pierre Jaquet-Droz was born La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1721. His genius was to create not only watches and clocks, but automata that helped promote his timepieces. 
His automata were considered wonders of the world. Three androids – the Writer, the Draughtsman, and the Musician – brought him international fame. Finished in 1774, and presented for the first time in La Chaux-de-Fonds, they caused a sensation. They ""performed"" for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in Paris in 1775, followed by a tour of various Royal Courts around Europe. Today, they are in the permanent collection of the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire in Neuchâtel, and are still working (the Museum demonstrates them to the public regularly).
Montres Jaquet Droz continues Pierre Jaquet-Droz's legacy, CEO Christian Lattmann tells us. In its workshops, 60 watchmakers and craftsmen create watches that are objets d'art. They range from off-centered Grande Seconde wristwatches, inspired by a Jaquet-Droz pocket watch with two intersecting dials forming a figure 8, to limited-edition pieces featuring exotic dials and wrist automatons. 
We begin in the showroom, where we meet ""Charlie,"" an android built in 2012 based on the Johnny Depp character Willy Wonka in the movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Charlie's hands hold two bells, which he raises to reveal current Jaquet Droz models. He is made of 2,693 mechanical parts and is animated by a system of 12 cams and 7 electric motors. 
Next, we see why Pierre Jaquet-Droz was considered a wizard. A technician shows us the master's ""Singing Bird Cage,"" made in 1780. It's a large, ornate, hanging cage, with a clock on the bottom, containing two birds. In the center of the cage, running top to bottom, is a crystal column. The technician winds the clock, and for 40 seconds a melody plays while the mechanical birds, with real bird feathers, chirp, moving their wings, beaks and tails, while 12 turning ""streams"" in the column create the illusion of a waterfall. The clock has six melodies, which can play on demand or on the hour. For our 21st century audience, it is amazing. For an 18th century audience, it must have been pure magic.
Knowing that we have just come from giant Omega, whose budgets for world-renowned ""ambassadors"" Lattmann can only dream of, he laughs as he tells me, ""The automata are our Cindy Crawford.""
Jaquet Droz's newest automaton wristwatch is the Magic Lotus Automaton. The dial features a small round watch face surrounded by a flowing steam. The watch dial is onyx and has two gold hands. The rest of the dial is brimming with decorative art creations that are Jaquet Droz's specialty.  
It depicts the four stages of a lotus flower: seed pods, bud, spring flower and fall flower. Two blue disks represent the stream. Also on the dial is a koi fish, a blue dragonfly, lotus leaves, water lilies, diamonds, sapphires, a ruby, and more. 
Push the button on the crown and the stream comes to life. The large disk rotates and the koi moves around the dial, flapping its tail and diving beneath the green lotus leaves. The water lilies bob up and down as the water flows. The entire animation runs for a full four minutes, with eight rotations of 30 seconds each. 
All the elements on the dial are made in workshops here. The koi and dragonfly are hand-carved in gold and painted; the lotus leaves and reed stems are made in Grand Feu enamel on a gold base; the lotus petals are carved from mother-of-pearl with a thin coat of translucent paint.   
The dial of the new Smalta Clara Hummingbird watch is made in plique-a-jour enamel crafted in Jaquet Droz workshops.
In the Atelier de Haute Horlogèrie (T2), each watch is assembled by hand by one watchmaker. Blancpain supplies Jaquet Droz with movements, which JD then modifies. Automata are manufactured in the Atelier Automaton, complete with a small sound studio to create chirping birds and other sounds. The movement in the new Magic Lotus watch, which took three years to develop, has 616 components; 500 of them are for the automaton. 
Painting, enameling, engraving, and sculpting are all done by hand in sunlit, monastery-quiet ateliers devoted to each craft.  
The Magic Lotus watch costs 200,000 Swiss francs before tax. JD will produce 28 pieces in red gold and 28 in white gold.
The main market for these pieces is Asia, Lattmann tells me. But demand is global. Last year, it sold all eight pieces of its remarkable Tropic Bird Repeater watch (price: CHF 650,000) in eight months, one to an American.
 
On Day 3, we head to Plan-les-Ouates on the outskirts of Geneva to visit the Harry Winston Manufacture. The Swatch Group acquired the famous New York diamond jewelry house in 2013 for $1 billion. Waiting to greet us is Nayla Hayek, CEO of Harry Winston, who is also chairwoman of the Swatch Group board of directors. ""You are very lucky,"" she tells us, underlining one of the reasons for the ""Time To Move"" press event. ""In Basel, you see only a few novelties. Here you will see all the novelties.""
In fact, we are lucky to be allowed inside this ultra-secure fortress at all, where millions of dollars worth of diamonds and gemstones are stored. We soon learn that the Time To Move press guests are the first outsiders ever shown the manufacturing ateliers.
While diamond jewelry is Winston's signature product, 180 employees here work on watches, Ms. Hayek tells us. Most of the watches are ladies' jewelry pieces.
It takes a week to produce the dial on Harry Winston's Premier Precious Micromosaic Automatic 36mm watch. It is hand-made using a mosaic glass setting and 14 brilliant-cut diamonds. 
Inside the gem-setting atelier, jewelers peer into Olympus SZ51 microscopes as they set cases, bracelets and dials with precious stones. We see jewelers setting the diamond-encrusted rectangular case of Harry Winston's Avenue Classic 20th Anniversary watches. The top-grade stones, set in Winston's famous ""invisible settings,"" are dazzling. It takes a jeweler four to five days to complete one case. 
Harry Winston watches use ETA movements primarily, mostly quartz in the ladies' pieces. The company gets its moon-phase complications for both ladies' and men's watches from Blancpain. 
Winston, of course, isn't only about women's watches. It has made high-profile forays into the high-mechanical world with its series of Opus and Histoire de Tourbillon watches and its use of exotic metals like zalium, a zirconium-aluminum alloy; the platinum-group metal ruthenium; and Winstonium, its exclusive platinum alloy. 
This year's men's headliner is the 10th and final piece in the Histoire de Tourbillon series. It's the first watch ever to include four separate tourbillons. The four tourbillons are positioned at the corners of the giant case, which extends horizontally along the wrist (45 mm x 32 mm x 12.85 m). They rotate once every 36 seconds, unified by three differentials. Histoire de Tourbillon 10 is a limited-edition of 21 pieces: 10 in rose gold, 10 in white gold (CHF750,000 each); and one in Winstonium (CHF770,000).
HW's newest zalium watch is Project Z13, also known as the Ocean Retrograde Automatic 42MM watch, with a zalium case and buckle. It's the first watch in the Zalium collection with a moon-phase display. This one, exclusive to HW, is unique: its shape is not round, but 12-sided, and it is suspended above the cut-out dial by transverse arms. Its automatic movement is made exclusively for Harry Winston. 
As for the Opus, we do not see the long-awaited Opus 15 (it's been nearly four years since the last one – the Opus 14 ""Jukebox For The Wrist""). However, the company says it expects to unveil it by the end of the year. 
 
We spend the afternoon with Glashütte Original in a hotel near the Geneva airport. GO's manufacture is nearly 500 miles away as the crow flies, in the famous watchmaking village of Glashütte in eastern Germany. Since the company can't bring the press to the manufacture, CEO Roland von Keith tells us (it's a long way from Geneva to Saxony), it brought the manufacture to the press. It set up a few manufacturing operations in the hotel ballroom. We're issued the obligatory white lab coats and head into the faux factory for a final round of novelties and technical presentations. 
In a temporary lab in the center of the room, two technicians perform some of the quality-control torture tests GO runs for shock-resistance and water-resistance. Elsewhere, around the room, watchmakers and technicians are performing demonstrations at benches.    
At one, a watchmaker is blueing screws. First, he mirror-polishes the tiny steel screw by hand, rubbing it on a polishing plate until it is glossy. This process protects it from corrosion. Then he places the screw, which is gray, on a small heating device on the workbench. The screw soon changes color, turning yellow, followed quickly by brown, red, violet, and then, at a temperature of 290° C, the color he desires: a deep blue, at which time he lifts it off the grill.
At the dial printing station, a technician from GO's dial factory in Pforzheim, Germany, demonstrates the ""pad printing"" process of manually applying logos on dials, one at a time. The pad-printing method uses a silicone or rubber ""balloon"" to pick up ink from a negative engraving, called a ""cliche."" Pulling the arm of the machine, the technician lowers the pad onto the negative. Then she slides the pad along a track to position it over a blank dial, and lowers the pad onto it. Voilà: the logo appears on the dial.
At another station, a watchmaker using a microscope is screwing 18 infinitesimal screws into a gold screw balance. The screw thread measures a ridiculous 0.35 mm – hence, the microscope. The watchmaker asks for a volunteer to perform the operation. Adam Craniotes, the irrepressible founder of the RedBar group, offers to be the guinea pig. Craniotes, like the rest of us, is sleep-deprived, which will hamper his dexterity. There's also a good chance he's sipped some of the fine Swiss wine served at lunch at Harry Winston, which won't help either. Amazingly, after a few tries, he manages to pick up a screw with the tweezers. But, alas, he drops it. Our gang groans when he lets us know. One of the group points to the screw, which landed on the counter top. It looks like a single speck of table salt. Craniotes doubles down. After repeated attempts, he manages to pick up another screw, and, mirabile dictu, screws it into a hole. He gets a hero's applause from his admiring peers. Now, only 17 more to go. He leaves those for the pro.
The episode drives home a major theme of the trip. We knew fine watchmaking was complicated. But we come away with a new understanding of just how devilishly difficult it is. And a deeper appreciation for those special souls who master its crafts.

The fate of Obamacare, the law that President Donald Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing, could hinge on several technical points of law as a federal appeals court prepares to decide whether it’s unconstitutional.
And the appeal of whatever the three-judge panel rules may land the Affordable Care Act back at the U.S. Supreme Court and in the public eye as the 2020 presidential election season is in full swing.
Several legal observers say they don’t expect the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to toss out a December decision from a federal judge in Texas invalidating the entire law. Obamacare critics say Congress never had the authority to require people to buy health insurance, and that argument was strengthened when lawmakers zeroed out the penalty for not doing so.
U.S. President Donald Trump
The three appellate judges -- two appointed by Republican presidents and one by a Democrat -- will consider the arguments on July 9. But before they get to the meat of the claim, they’ll wrestle with a more basic question: Who has the right to even be in the case. That issue arose a few months ago when Trump signaled he’d no longer defend the law, after initially saying elements of the ACA might be worth saving. The judges have already asked the sides to weigh in on whether Democrats can defend the law if Trump won’t. Legal scholars say procedural questions like that might determine the outcome of the case rather than the merits of each side’s arguments.
The case could throw the country’s health-care system into disarray and raise further questions about whether any law, not just the Affordable Care Act, can be sunk if just one provision must go.
Insurance companies Centene Corp. and Molina Health Inc., which have large Obamacare enrollments, would have their business models upended if the law is tossed out. Centene had almost 2 million ACA members on its rolls last year, giving it about 20% of the entire Obamacare health-care exchange population.
The costs of losing ACA protections for millions of Americans is “impossible to calculate but enormous,” said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law school professor. “It’s so alarming how much is riding on this technical legal argument.”
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Judge Reed O’Connor ruled the entire ACA must fall because the tax penalty that gave it constitutional justification was gone. That ruling came a month after Democrats recaptured the House in the 2018 midterm elections, campaigning in part on protecting Obamacare. Congressional Democrats jumped into the case alongside the blue states, led by California, to oppose 18 red states, led by Texas.
Conservatives say Congress can’t force everyone to buy insurance. “What in the Constitution delegates to Congress the authority to pass a general health-care bill like the Affordable Care Act?” asked John Eidsmoe, senior counsel at the Foundation for Moral Law, an Alabama-based Christian legal advocacy group that’s supporting the Republican states. “Health insurance until very recently has never been considered the responsibility of the federal government.”
The Supreme Court said in a 5-4 ruling in 2012 that a penalty for going without insurance was a lawful exercise of Congress’s taxing power. When Congress wiped out that penalty in 2017, Republican states sued, arguing that the ACA could not survive because the mandate was no longer a lawful tax.
Despite some public opposition to hefty insurance deductibles and rising premiums, Obamacare provided health coverage for as many as 24 million Americans, either through expanded Medicaid or independent marketplaces and federal subsidies.
If the appeals court finds neither congressional Democrats nor blue states have the right to challenge the lower-court ruling, the judges could throw out the appeal and let O’Connor’s ruling stand.
“The district court in Texas could then go back and issue an injunction stopping the Affordable Care Act from operating,” said Abbe Gluck, a law professor at Yale Law School. “You can see now how dramatic it would be to allow that to occur without the opportunity to appeal the lower court’s decision.”
People who would lose health coverage if the law is dismantled could then file a new lawsuit seeking to reinstate Obamacare, said Joshua Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston.
This means the entire case could essentially get a do-over.
The case is being watched by lawmakers, lobbyists, and legal scholars on both sides of the aisle.
Despite trying dozens of times to repeal the ACA, Republicans were never able to do so. Trump campaigned on a platform that prominently featured repealing Obamacare. On his first day as president, Trump signed an executive order blocking enforcement of the tax penalty for non-compliance with the individual mandate.
With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans tried again to repeal the law but failed memorably on July 28, 2017, when Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona cast a televised thumbs-down vote to buck his political party and keep Obamacare alive. Later that year, Congress passed a measure that repealed the tax penalty but left the rest of Obamacare intact.
The case is Texas v. U.S., 19-10011, U.S. Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.

It’s the site of the final two races of the season and the only one this year set in U.S. shores.
And it’s a big deal. Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Mahindra, NIO, Nissan, and Porsche are all multimillions-of-dollars-deep into developing their involvement;  Nico Rosberg, Qualcomm, and Discovery are investors. They see the racing series as a critical testing ground for technologies on tap for the transportation devices of the future. Brands like Hugo Boss, Bremont, and Tag Heuer are hosting parties, conferences, and drive events for press and VIPs the week before the races; Harley Davidson is using it as an opportunity to unveil its first-ever electric motorcycle, Livewire.
Indeed, Formula E is a celebration of the future of electric autos. It provides stark relief between those companies that can make a viable electric motor and those that can’t. Whereas F1 technologies are so proprietary and secretive that fans need they need a university degree to wade through the distinctions, Formula E teams use the same battery with the same amount of energy; the team that designs the most efficient motor is very likely to win. (That’s with no small effort from one of the welterweight-fit race car drivers, of course.)
The stakes are high, if still speculative. Today, battery-powered vehicles account for 1.2% of automotive sales worldwide, but by 2025 their number is expected jump to nearly 11 million vehicles sold,  10 times what it is today. The key for automakers in the meantime is to convince consumers that electric cars are reliable and durable enough to withstand daily, crushing, enthusiastic, and even monotonous use.
Tickets to the 2019 New York City E-Prix can be had cheap, at $12. Without the ear-drum-blowing, dangerous decibels of a F1 race, the races presents a family-friendly opportunity to see at thrilling proximity how an emerging sport is gathering speed. (No pun intended.)
Plus, while you’re there, you can explore one of New York’s most exciting,  fast-developing neighborhoods. (Plus the largest Ikea, complete with Swedish meatballs, you’ve probably ever seen.) Here are our best recommendations for where to eat, drink, and watch during the Formula E races, and even sleep the night before.

Formula E is like Formula One but with cars powered by electric batteries, rather than conventional engines. This season, 22 drivers from 11 teams are racing to win the top spot by the end of the series, which has taken them to such locales as  Santiago, Hong Kong, Paris, Monaco, Rome, and Marrakesh, Morocco.
The official ABB FIA Formula E Championship includes two separate titles, one for the winning driver and one for the winning team. The driver championship goes to whoever earns the most points over the eight-month season. The team championship goes to the team with the highest combined scores of its two drivers over the season. This season, Frenchman Jean-Éric Vergne is currently in first place among the drivers, and China’s DS Techeetah leads the team rankings.
Drivers earn points by finishing well in each race, with 25 points awarded to the race winner, 18 points to the runner-up, 15 points for a third-place finish, and so forth. Tenth place earns one point, after which no points are awarded. The driver who is at pole position earns an additional three points, while the driver who sets the fastest lap and finishes in the top 10 gets an additional one.
The drivers have two ways to get more power for their cars during a race—and these launch it squarely into live-action video game territory, unlike the analog Formula One. The first one is called Attack Mode. To do this, drivers leave the racing line and drive through a slower lane in the “activation zone.” If they do this, they get an extra 25 kW of power unlocked on the powertrain, which they can use to help them speed through the next few laps. Or they can win the “Fan Boost” power surge, which is determined by fan voting. This awards the driver a 25 kW power boost during a five-second window in the second half of a race. Fans can vote for favorite drivers online or live on Twitter by using the hashtag of the name of their chosen driver along with #FANBOOST.
It is forbidden to use more than four new rear and four new front tires during each racing weekend, from shakedown through the end of the race. If for some reason, a team burns through its allotted supply of tires, it’s out of the race. All teams must use special, bespoke, 18-inch, all-weather Michelin tires.
No charging of any car is allowed during qualifying rounds and the E-Prix, but teams can charge their cars between sessions and during practice. Cars are charged on generators powered by glycerine, a zero-emission bio-diesel byproduct; it takes one hour to fully charge. Only one car is used per driver per race.   
 
Fridays are typically for shakedowns, when drivers and teams get to know the track and evaluate the technology and mechanics of their cars.
Each race weekend involves practice sessions—one 45 minutes long and one 30 minutes long—on the first track day, as well as one on the second track day. The time keepers are engaged during the practice sessions, but the results don’t count toward final standings.
Qualifying rounds happen before each day’s main events on Saturday and Sunday. They determine the order in which each driver will start the race. They’re run in groups of up to six cars, so there’s a little more room to maneuver on the track. Each group posts its fastest lap, and the fastest six times go on to compete in a “super pole” shootout wherein drivers compete one-by-one for pole position. The driver with the fastest qualifying time gets the first-place start, and the driver with the slowest time starts at the back. Qualifying sessions last one hour.
The race itself is called the “E-Prix.” It lasts 45 minutes, plus one lap. Once the leader has crossed the finish line after 45 minutes of racing, everyone does one more lap before the race is officially over.
 
 This season will see new cars racing around 12 cities. (Previous model cars are  now on sale to collectors.) The 2019 car has a battery with capacity nearly double that of its predecessor; it will debut in New York with 250 kW of power (equal to 335 bhp) and can accelerate from zero to 62 mph in 2.8 seconds. Top speed is 280 kilometers per hour (174 mph).
The minimum weight of the car and driver together is 900 kilograms (1,984 pounds). (The battery alone weighs 385 kg, or 849 pounds.) Each car is 5,160 millimeters long and 1,770 mm wide, or about 17 feet long and nearly six feet wide.
The halo ring around the top of the cockpit on the new cars is there for protection in the event of a crash. It also has an LED strip that flashes blue, when the driver is in Attack Mode, and magenta, when a driver is using Fanboost. 
The 1.5-mile track runs along the historic Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, deep in Brooklyn’s Red Hook section. Because of its 14 corners, it is considered the toughest in the series for all 22 cars and drivers. There will be grandstands, paddocks, entertainment areas, and VIP lounges for ticket holders and attendees.
Inevitably, cars will collide. Usually, the impact isn’t severe; as the old saying goes, if you’re not rubbing, you’re not racing. But when bad collisions happen, the halo ring that sits above the cockpit will protects drivers from the force of 14 cars stacked on top of their vehicle. Here is a compilation of the most dramatic crashes of the season so far. 
 Jean-Éric VergneThe Frenchman won last year’s championship, clinching the title after the New York E-Prix in 2018. Vergne competed in Formula One for Scuderia Toro Rosso from 2012 to 2014 and was a Ferrari test and development driver from 2015 to 2016. In the standings this year driving for Techeetah, he is currently in first place.
 Lucas Di Grassi The Brazilian racer drives for Audi’s Formula E team. He won the Formula E championship title in the 2016/2017 season; this year he’s currently in second place.
 Mitch Evans The Kiwi won his first-ever Formula E race in Rome this year, driving for Panasonic Jaguar Racing. He’s currently in third place.
 André LottererThe German racer is the second driver for Techeetah, currently in fourth place and helping boost the team to an all-around top post so far in the series. He is famous for his three wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving for Audi, and for winning the World Endurance championship in 2012. 
 
 DS TecheetahThe Chinese motor racing team is currently leading the team standings under team principal Mark Preston. Its two drivers hold the first and fourth positions going into July’s races.
 Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler  Germany’s Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler was one of the founding members of the Formula E racing series. The team principal is Allan McNish, who has led the team to its current second-place standing.
 Envision Virgin Racing  The British racing team is majority-owned by Envision Energy, with Sylvain Filippi as principal. A founding member of the Formula E series, it currently sits in third place in the overall standings.
 BMW i Andretti MotorsportAt No. 6, BMW i Andretti racing is the top-ranked team with a U.S. affiliation. It sits in the Andretti Autosport conglomerate owned and operated by former driving champion Michael Andretti.  
By Shuttle — Free shuttles to the track leave from Carroll Gardens and from the Atlantic Terminal near Barclays Center every half hour.
By Subway — The Carroll Street Station stop on the F Line is a 15-minute walk to the track.
By Car — Street parking will be a challenge, so plan to park in an outdoor lot, pay with cash, and walk to the event. Better yet, go by taxi or car service.
By Citi Bike — You can pick them up all over Brooklyn and in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. If you get one in Manhattan, ride over the Brooklyn Bridge for beautiful views. Allow an hour or so for the ride, but remember to dock the bike/re-check it out every 30 minutes, or risk a fee. 
 
Tickets — Prices start at $12 and reach $390 for two-day lounge passes.
Sunscreen — There will be indoor lounges and covered areas and seating, but the grandstand seats lie under direct sunlight. Plan ahead to protect your skin.
Ear Plugs — Formula E has nowhere near the sound level of Formula 1, which can reach 140 decibels during a race. But at a top level of 80 decibels, Formula E still merits some ear protection."

The Internal Revenue Service has released rules with the formula that determines how much Ivy League universities and other wealthy colleges will pay under a new tax.
The rules define how colleges and universities count the number of full-time students and offer some guidance about what income and assets are subject to the tax. Those factors and others will determine how much they will owe on their investments under the new 1.4% excise tax, according to IRS guidance issued Friday.
In the crosshairs are some of the richest research universities, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Princeton, as well as liberal arts colleges with sizable endowments such as Iowa’s Grinnell College, Williams College in Massachusetts and Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.
The endowment tax -- included in President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul to offset some of the tax cuts -- affects private colleges and universities with at least $500,000 of endowment per student. Schools have been waiting for the government to reveal how endowments are counted and what constitutes a student before they can calculate their tax bill.

The tax, which most affected schools will pay this fiscal year for the first time, is based on investment returns for the fiscal year, which for most colleges ends June 30. Schools typically don’t announce revised values for their endowments until the fall.
In total, approximately 30 schools have been expected reach the threshold, based on U.S. Education Department data and the endowment values of June 2018, the most recent available, when many reached record high values. Unaffected colleges worry that the tax could be widened to add public universities, or that Congress could tweak the threshold to pull in more schools.
Endowments grow from investment returns and tax-deductible gifts. They hold assets of about $617 billion, concentrated among the richest institutions, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Colleges and University Business Officers. The wealthiest is Harvard with $39.2 billion.
Colleges may be looking for ways to avoid paying the tax, according to research published in 2018 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Some schools may increase their enrollment -- or change how they classify students -- to lower their endowment-per-student ratio to skirt the tax.
They have also been lobbying Congress to repeal the tax entirely. A bipartisan bill proposed in 2018 hasn’t been re-introduced in the new Congress. Representative Tom Reed, the New York Republican who developed the plan for the endowment tax, has proposed giving institutions more exceptions in exchange for spending more on aid for middle-income students and disclosing information about fees paid to outside investment managers.
The tax is estimated to raise about $200 million a year, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.

A Utah entrepreneur accused of running a Ponzi scheme to expand a U.S. network of luxury event-rental venues was ordered to surrender a chunk of the proceeds from the sale of his $2.4 million home while jilted investors pursue their legal claims against him.
U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell in Salt Lake City issued a so-called writ of attachment to $845,000 from the sale of the property owned by Noah Corp. founder William ""Bil"" Bowser in the ski-resort town of Park City. Noah and Bowser are among those sued by retirees who invested millions of dollars in one proposed rental facility that was never built.
The ruling is the latest in a dispute that pits hundreds of investors against Bowser, his family and Noah, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May. The plaintiffs claim he used money from new investors to pay off earlier ones, while soliciting wealthy retirees keen to avoid taxes and generate income from luxury venues rented out for weddings and corporate events.
“Plaintiffs contend that the defendants were operating a Ponzi scheme because the defendants, and particularly Mr. Bowser, were using funds from new investors to cover costs for projects and lease payments to earlier investors,” Campbell said in her order on Monday. While the judge has yet to rule on the claims, she said the “plaintiffs have established the likelihood of success” in their allegations of unjust enrichment by Bowser and others.
Bowser was ordered to deposit about $348,000 with the court, and another $497,000 earmarked for the purchase of a townhouse was encumbered by the writ, according to court records.

In April, about a dozen investors who put up a combined $4.9 million to build a high-end Noah event venue in Carmel, Indiana, filed a lawsuit after learning that the facility was never constructed. They alleged the cash was used on other projects and operations at Noah’s Utah headquarters. The Carmel site is vacant, court records show, and Noah filed for bankruptcy a month after the suit was filed.
Reed Rawson, one of the attorneys who represents Noah and Bowser, didn’t immediately return a call for comment.
Bowser raised an unspecified sum from investors to build an estimated 42 facilities from New Hampshire to Florida to Utah. Many now claim Noah raised far more money to build the structures than they are actually worth.
Campbell said Monday it was too soon to rule on the investors’ claim about a Ponzi scheme, which could result in all financial transfers from Noah to Bowser’s construction company, Gabriel Management Corp., being deemed fraudulent. Under Noah’s expansion strategy, small groups of investors teamed up to own individual venues in 25 states, with Noah as their guaranteed tenant.
The judge noted that Bowser, in earlier court testimony, had “unilaterally” decided to redirect the money that was raised to build the site in Carmel.
“When asked at the hearing why he did not use the Carmel investors’ money to develop the Carmel project and keep that project on track, his only answer was that he put the money where it was most needed to keep those projects afloat,” Campbell said. “In essence, he said something to the effect of, ‘you do what you have to do.’""
Bowser also told investors during a conference call in May that he was “robbing Peter to pay Paul,” according to the judge’s ruling.
Bowser hasn’t filed for personal bankruptcy, and the case may give the group of investors greater access to his assets. Hundreds of people who invested in other Noah sites, as well as shareholders in the Noah parent company, are scrambling to recover their investments in bankruptcy court.
The case is DiTucci v. Ashby, 2:19-cv-00277, U.S. District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City).

Mirazur in Menton, France, is the No. 1 restaurant in the world.
This is the first time  chef Mauro Colagreco and his sunny Provencal dining room have clinched the top spot; previously the restaurant was No. 3. This is also the first time France has gotten the No. 1 spot since the awards began 18 years ago.
That’s in part because executives behind the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list made a profound change to the rules this year, decreeing that no previous winner can be No. 1 again—or even be ranked on the list.
Previous winners have now been relegated to a “Best of the Best” category. That includes  Osteria Francescana, Massimo Bottura’s modernist restaurant in Modena, which has won the award twice; Eleven Madison Park, which took the top spot in 2017; El Cellar de Can Roca; and the original Noma.
But the 2.0 version of Noma, which is set in a different location in Copenhagen with a new menu format, is eligible for the top spot and in fact skyrocketed to the No. 2 place on the list. William Drew, group editor of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, says the criteria they used, which included location and menu concept, was not just to allow Noma, one of the world’s highest-profile dining spots, to be in contention. “The aim is to have an objective set of criteria that prevails over time,” he says. Leading up to the announcement, which took place in Singapore on the evening of June 25 before an audience, Noma was an insider favorite to clinch the top spot.
The Best of the Best is a convenient landing place for some formerly top-ranked restaurants that have been falling on the list, like the Fat Duck in Bray, England, which last year came in at No. 74. Nonetheless, chef/owner Heston Blumenthal is sanguine about the experience: “If you get on the list, lap it up, bathe in the warmth of it, but just do your work. Nothing is permanent.”
Mirazur sits at the foot of a mountain and is housed in a 1930s building looking out over the sea, just inside France’s border with Italy. The Argentine-born chef draws inspiration from the region, serving vegetables from his own gardens and other local produce to create colorful Mediterranean dishes. Colagreco’s signature creation is oyster with tapioca, shallot cream and pear. The lunch menu costs 160 euros ($180), while the full menu is 260 euros.
“What a great year. Three Michelin stars and No. 1 all in the same year,” said Colagreco while accepting the award. “It’s a year I shall remember forever. I don’t have words to explain. I own the sky!”
He says the next step after basking in the awards is to expand his “little” 5-acre gardens into something greater. “We are fantastic producers, winemakers—we are a little paradise. Our vision is to share and to try to give love and to live happily with our work. It is a simple vision, but it is a vision of life.”
The World’s 50 Best committee also announced that it is highlighting diversity in advance of the ceremony. According to the website, voters are asked to “take issues of representation and reputation into consideration with their choices.”
This year, the list was also expanded from 100 to 120 to coincide with the list’s leading sponsor, San Pellegrino, celebrating its 120th anniversary. It’s a “one-off” expansion, according to Drew.
The restaurants appearing on the list from 51-120 were released ahead of time. That half of the list included restaurants from 25 countries, which demonstrates one good reason to expand the list, advertiser anniversaries notwithstanding. The expansion also makes it easier to highlight restaurants in cities that haven’t caught the 50 Best’s attention before, like Alcade in Guadalajara, Mexico (109 on the list). “We embraced the opportunity to showcase an even more diverse range of restaurants,” says Drew.
A lot of the buzz around the awards are the drops—and this was a year that saw more dramatic movement than usual. Besides Noma, Atelier Crenn in San Francisco entered the list at No. 35, and The Chairman, a Cantonese spot with dishes like flowery crab with aged Chinese wine, was another new entry at No. 41. The host city, Singapore, cracked the top 20: The elegant Odette moved up to No. 18.
Among the notable demotions on the list was Attica in Melbourne, which fell an astonishing 64 spots, to No. 84 from 20. Also eyebrow-raising were perennial favorites Arzak in San Sebastian, Spain, to No. 53 from 31, and D.O.M. in Sao Paulo, which fell to No. 54 from 30.
The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list is organized and compiled by William Reed Business Media. It is created from the votes of 1,040 restaurateurs, chefs, food writers and foodies. The voters are split into 26 separate regions around the world. Each region has its own panel of 40 members. (Vines formerly chaired the U.K. and Ireland panel; he is no longer involved.) The awards started in 2002 as a feature in Restaurant, a U.K. publication, based on the picks of journalists and chefs. The founders compare it to a music magazine compiling a best-albums list.
Ahead of Tuesday evening’s ceremony, three awards were announced: Daniela Soto-Innes, of Cosme in New York, won Elit Vodka World’s Best Female Chef; the American Express Icon Award went to the humanitarian chef  José Andrés; and Lido 84, a locally focused restaurant in Lombardy, Italy, won the Miele One to Watch.
Here are the winners (with last year’s place in parentheses). “NEW ENTRY” indicates the first time the restaurant has appeared on the list. “RE-ENTRY” indicates its reappearance on the list after a year of absence (i.e., due to a closing/renovation).

The Philippines rejected China’s suggestion to jointly probe the June 9 collision in the South China Sea involving the two nations’ boats.
“There will be no joint investigation. China and the Philippines will conduct their respective investigations,” Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin said Friday on his official Twitter account.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang, at a briefing Thursday, proposed a joint probe of a Chinese vessel’s collision with a Philippine boat near Reed Bank, which left 22 Filipino fishermen floating at sea and rescued later by a Vietnamese crew.
The two countries “can exchange respective findings and properly handle the matter through friendly consultations” by jointly investigating the incident, the Chinese official said.

Longtime Walt Disney Co. chief Michael Eisner has a prediction: Major sports properties like the NFL and NBA will eventually leave broadcast television.
That means waving goodbye to CBS, NBC, Fox and Disney’s own ABC. And saying hello to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.
Tech companies will come in “like Jim Brown for the Cleveland Browns in 1960 -- they’re going to be breaking through the line,” Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades before leaving in 2005, said on the Bloomberg Business of Sports podcast.
Michael Eisner
Some technology companies are already experimenting with live sports. Amazon.com Inc., for instance, pays about $65 million a year for “Thursday Night Football.” Facebook Inc. shows Major League Baseball games, as does Google’s YouTube, which distributes NBA games in Africa and also carries several Major League Soccer teams.
But so far, the money involved hardly compares to what traditional networks are paying for their packages of live sports rights. CBS, Fox and NBC, for instance, are shelling out $3.1 billion annually for NFL rights that expire after the 2022 season.
Sports leagues are increasingly looking for technology companies that can offer an interactive stream -- with social-media commentary and statistics that entice the eyeballs of kids raised on video games and Snapchat.
“Sports lights up your platform,” said Eisner, who owns Portsmouth, a third division English soccer team that he often watches play online. “With the financial wherewithal of Apple, the aggressiveness of Amazon, the creativity of Netflix, the existence already of ESPN and ESPN+ -- you’re going to see a very difficult time ahead for the U.S. broadcasters. I wouldn’t be surprised if all sports of that level eventually leave broadcast television.”
Eisner didn’t offer a timetable for such a migration, predicting that it wouldn’t happen all at once. Nor does he pay much attention to executives who deny any interest in showing live sports. As an early investor and advocate for Netflix Inc., Eisner recalled company executives Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos telling him they would never do original programming.
“Then they did original programming. Then they told me they would never do animation -- and they did animation. Then they said they would never do sports -- and now some of them are doing sports,” the 77-year-old said.
Eisner said his experience with Portsmouth, whose games are digitally distributed around the globe, is a microcosm of what’ll happen with leagues and teams -- all of which are seeking ways to reach a worldwide audience.
International sports will bring “a whole new era of value for sports,” Eisner said. “It’s more important today than ever.”

Sometimes she’s on twice. Her daytime talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, brings in more advertising revenue than Dr. Phil’s and Kelly Ripa’s combined, and her prime-time special, Ellen’s Game of Games, gets consistently good ratings. DeGeneres produces movies, voices a popular Pixar character, has her own digital content network, and has earned at least $500 million on endorsement and TV deals, according to a Bloomberg Billionaires Index analysis. She has her own lifestyle brand and last year formed a partnership with Walmart Inc. to create a clothing and accessories line that’s awash in American flags and rainbows and is sold in 2,300 Walmart stores. “I’m still gay, by the way. It’s really working out for me now,” DeGeneres said in her Netflix stand-up special last year.
That the largest U.S. retailer finds value in aligning itself with a 61-year-old lesbian who has a recurring segment on her talk show called “Oh, Straight People,” is, in many ways, a testament to how thoroughly Americans have accepted LGBTQ rights. It’s been 50 years since the Stonewall uprising in New York marked the start of the modern gay rights movement. Almost two-thirds of Americans support same-sex marriage, Gallup polls show, the opposite of what they reported when DeGeneres first came out two decades ago. The chief executive of America’s first trillion-dollar company, Apple Inc., is  gay, and yet iPhones still fly off the shelves. Walt Disney Co. this year had its first gay characters on both its youth cable channel and in its latest Avengers film. According to GLAAD, 8.8% of prime-time TV characters are gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. Walmart even has a Pride shop online.

Such mainstreaming of LGBTQ products, characters, and culture would have been almost unthinkable 22 years ago, when DeGeneres publicly came out as a lesbian. Back then, being gay almost killed her career.
DeGeneres had spent the first few decades of her life pretending to be someone she wasn’t. Her stand-up rarely included jokes about dating or relationships, as if she were avoiding the issue. That changed in April 1997, when she came out in an interview with Time magazine, which put her on its cover along with the headline “Yep, I’m Gay.” That month 42 million people watched her character come out on her sitcom, Ellen. The episode—with Oprah Winfrey guest-starring as her therapist—was funny, well-received by critics, and enthusiastically celebrated by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender fans. Advertisers felt differently.
“Everybody warned me. My publicist, my manager, my agent. Everybody making money off me said, ‘Don’t do it,’ ” DeGeneres said in her Netflix special. The blowback hit her fast and strong. Evangelical pastor Jerry Falwell called her “Ellen DeGenerate.” A bomb scare, which cleared the TV studio shortly after the episode’s taping, was the first of many threats against her. Advertisers soon backed out. “We don’t think it is a smart business decision to be advertising in an environment that is so polarized,” a spokeswoman for Chrysler told the New York Times, explaining the carmaker’s decision to pull commercials from the show.
One Ellen episode was even slapped with a parental advisory warning after DeGeneres’s character shared a platonic kiss with a woman. Soon after, ABC canceled the show, and the job offers stopped coming.
“If I’d been fully aware of all the consequences—that the public was going to hate me and the press was going to attack me, that I was going to lose a lot of people—maybe I wouldn’t have done it,” she told writer Eric Marcus in early 2001, when she was still struggling to get back on TV. “But I didn’t feel like I had a choice.”
DeGeneres’s rare act of honesty couldn’t change the fact that the 1990s were a bleak time for the LGBTQ community. AIDS was killing thousands of people, primarily gay men. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, banning federal recognition of same-sex marriages. Two years later, a gay student, Matthew Shepard, was tortured and killed in Laramie, Wyo. DeGeneres spoke at a vigil for Shepard held on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in October 1998. “This is what I was trying to stop,” she said, in tears. “This is exactly why I did what I did.”
At the time, no company better represented the cultural climate DeGeneres was hoping to change than Walmart, the multibillion-dollar enterprise co-founded by Sam Walton, who taught Sunday school at his Presbyterian church and preached a Christianity-laced corporate gospel of service, respect, and sacrifice.
“If you want to reach the Christian population on Sunday, you do it from the church pulpit,” Ralph Reed, the architect of the politically powerful Christian Coalition, once said. “But if you want to reach them on Saturday, do it at Walmart.”
In the 1990s the company refused to sell albums that contained swear words; even John Mellencamp’s heartland rock was censored and sanitized for shoppers’ protection. Then in 2001 female Walmart employees accused the company of denying them promotions and equal pay in a litigation campaign that evolved into a class-action lawsuit. (In 2011 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the then 1.5 million-women-strong group  couldn’t be considered a class; individual lawsuits have since been filed and are ongoing.) In sworn statements, women at Walmart said they endured comments such as “God made Adam first, so women would always be second to men.” A spokesman for Walmart says the allegations “are not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart” and that it will defend itself against the claims.
Walmart’s revenue and profit soared, but by the mid-2000s the company was grappling with withering criticism of its business and labor practices. It also wanted to break into urban markets such as New York City and Chicago, where social attitudes are more liberal. So, Walmart changed. In 2006 it plunged head-first into LGBTQ activism by joining the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), donating to gay-friendly charities, and hiring a consulting firm that specialized in marketing to gay consumers. Not all of the company’s 1.3 million employees liked the stance. Nor did Christian conservative groups, which called for a boycott over the Thanksgiving weekend. Its business threatened, Walmart quickly caved. In 2007 it dropped the NGLCC partnership and released a statement saying that it would “not make corporate contributions to support or oppose highly controversial issues unless they directly relate to our ability to serve our customers.”
“I was mad. I was very mad,” NGLCC co-founder and President Justin Nelson recalls. “They have spent years correcting that mistake.”
For the next few years Walmart shied away from anything related to gay rights. In 2013, for example, it declined to join Disney, Nike, and Starbucks in urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. A year later the company seemed to have a change of heart. It opposed a 2015 bill in its home state of Arkansas that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against gay customers on religious grounds. It earned, then lost, then won back a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, a highly regarded measure of LGBTQ-friendly workplaces that companies often use as a recruiting tool.
Earlier this year, a Walmart commercial featured two gay men shopping together. The American Family Association criticized the ad, saying Walton was “probably turning over in his grave.” Walmart, it noted, had almost always sided with Christian conservatives in the past. “At least with a company like Amazon, we knew they were liberal from the outset,” a statement on its website said. “But this seems more like a betrayal from a well-known friend.”
DeGeneres’s comeback started in 2001 when she hosted the Emmy Awards, which had been postponed twice after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her characteristically upbeat and self-deprecating jokes brought much needed relief in somber times. “They can’t take away our creativity, our striving for excellence, our joy,” she said. “Only network executives can do that.” The audience gave her a standing ovation.
With that, DeGeneres was back in Hollywood’s good graces. A second attempt at a sitcom was short-lived, but then came a best-selling book and voice-over work as Dory in Pixar’s animated hit Finding Nemo. Still, her sexuality was considered controversial. When her talk show debuted in 2003, DeGeneres remembers a station manager saying, “No one is going to watch a lesbian during the day.”
That prediction was quickly proved wrong—the show won the Daytime Emmy for outstanding talk show four years in a row—and DeGeneres soon became a coveted corporate sponsor. American Express Co. hired her first, in 2004. Then came a J.C. Penney Co. deal that prompted the threat of a boycott from a group called One Million Moms, which objected to the retailer’s use of a homosexual spokeswoman. (J.C. Penney stuck by DeGeneres.) Today DeGeneres has a lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen, that was born out of the work she and her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, do of buying, renovating, and selling Los Angeles mansions to buyers such as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. What started as a home decor line has expanded into clothing, accessories, and pet products. Macy’s, Nordstrom, PetSmart, and Bed, Bath & Beyond carry the line, which has an annual revenue in the nine figures.
“Her power of influence makes her truly extraordinary,” says Matt Fleming, director for celebrity acquisition at the Marketing Arm. According to surveys conducted by the agency, DeGeneres is as well-known and liked as Paul McCartney.
With an average of 2.9 million viewers per day according to Nielsen, her daytime TV show pulls a surprisingly diverse audience. It’s 74% female, consumer insights firm MRI-Simmons estimates, but otherwise mostly matches the general population in age, race, and education.
“Ellen is the Oprah of our era, in the sense of how much she dominates the category,” says Dan Wilch, a consultant at Magid Associates, which conducts an annual study of daytime TV. Phil McGraw’s show, Dr. Phil, may get better ratings, but according to Kantar data, DeGeneres’s show pulled in more than twice as much ad revenue.
Walmart’s partnership with DeGeneres gives the retailer a widely popular ally in its battle against Amazon. It carries both ED by Ellen and EV1, DeGeneres’s clothing brand, which comes in a wide range of sizes and looks like a cheaper version (everything is $30 or under) of the kind of pants-and-jean-jacket outfits DeGeneres wears. Walmart declined to provide sales figures for EV1 but says it’s “pleased” with the line. “Ellen is Ellen,” says Janey Whiteside, Walmart’s chief customer officer. “She appeals to all ages. She’s great.”
DeGeneres’s clean-cut, friendly image—she ends her show by reminding viewers to “be kind to one another”—is reassuring for brands in this perilous marketing era when any misstep could result in a massive social media backlash. As Jeff Greenfield, co-founder of advertising analytics firm C3 Metrics, puts it, “Ellen is safe.” She loves animals. She dances. She often has her wife on as a guest. The couple have been married for more than a decade. “Even when we talk with very conservative brands, they don’t shy away,” says Stacy Jones, CEO of the product placement firm Hollywood Branded. “She is a family brand.”
The American Family Association today seems uncharacteristically mum about DeGeneres. While it released that scathing rebuke of Walmart for its gay-friendly commercial, it didn’t respond to a request for comment on the chain’s partnership with the comedian.
In the Netflix special, DeGeneres joked about how everybody is now fine with her being a lesbian. Instead, her most alienating characteristic is that she’s rich. “Do you think you’re still relatable?” she said a friend recently asked her. “Of course I’m relatable,” DeGeneres replied, then followed her butler into the solarium for breakfast.
Later, the butler drew her a bath but left her towel out of reach. “So I had to do that bath mat scoot all the way across the bathroom to get the towel,” she said, acting it out on stage. “And then I stopped and thought, Oh my God, this is relatable! People do the bath mat scoot when the butler forgets to put the towel next to the tub!” —With Tom Metcalf

The Philippine government has fallen in with Beijing’s explanation that a Chinese vessel didn’t intentionally hit a Filipino boat in the South China Sea on June 9.
Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Wednesday described the incident as ""just an accident,"" adding the Chinese vessel may have left after hitting and sinking a Philippine boat with 22 fishermen out of fear of being “besieged” by other boats near Reed Bank.
Delfin Lorenzana
“Maybe the other side didn’t mean to brush against our boat,” Lorenzana said at a televised briefing in Manila on Wednesday.
The Philippines’ Navy chief earlier said the Chinese vessel ""rammed"" the Filipino boat which was anchored when it was hit, while the spokesman of the military unit in charge of the disputed waters said the incident was ""far from accidental."" Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin also protested the incident, which he said he’d call a ""hit and run.""
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is not favoring China after the incident, said Lorenzana, who has also called for an apology and compensation from the Chinese vessel’s captain for damaging the Philippine boat.
China’s Foreign Ministry earlier described the incident as an “accidental collision,” while Beijing’s embassy in Manila said the Chinese vessel’s crew was “afraid” of other Philippine boats in the area, prompting the captain to leave the Filipino fishermen.
The sunken Philippine boat’s crew wants Duterte to ask China to hold the Chinese vessel’s captain criminally liable for abandoning them at sea, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said at a separate briefing after meeting the fishermen.
“There is no justification to the act of the Chinese vessel to abandon the Filipino fishermen. Under international maritime laws, that is illegal. Under human laws, that is immoral,” Pinol said.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is standing by China over a collision involving the two nations’ boats in the South China Sea, with his spokesman casting doubts on local fishermen’s accounts of the incident.
In his first public statement about what he described as a “maritime incident,” Duterte said China’s side should be heard on the collision that resulted in a Philippine vessel carrying 22 fishermen sinking in disputed waters on June 9. The crew were rescued by a Vietnamese fishing boat and a Philippine Navy ship.
“It is best investigated. I don’t issue a statement now because there’s no investigation and no result,"" Duterte said in speech at a Philippine Navy event on Monday night. ""The only thing we can do is wait and give the other party the right to be heard.”

The Philippines will not escalate tensions with China by sending military ships to the South China Sea following the collision, he added, reiterating his nation isn’t ready to go to war with Beijing.
At a briefing Tuesday, Duterte’s spokesman Salvador Panelo said there are ""circumstances that give doubt to the version"" of the Filipino fishermen, including how most of them were asleep when the collision happened.
“The President doesn’t want this to be blown into an international crisis,” Panelo said. “We are being careful because there will be repercussions if we make the wrong move.”
Duterte stuck to his pro-China stance despite calls from the opposition, led by Vice President Leni Robredo, to change his “passive” China policy by actively asserting the nation’s rights in the disputed waters. Robredo, in a Facebook post Sunday, also called on Duterte’s government to demand the Chinese fishermen’s trial in the Philippines.
Duterte now has to convince the public that friendly ties with China is still the way to go, said Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines’ Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea.
“Between the Philippine government and the Chinese government the friendship policy has been set, but this incident has happened and casts doubt on the sincerity and wisdom of it to the Filipino people,” Batongbacal said.
The Philippines’ long-term position in the South China Sea dispute may be weakened if Duterte maintains his pro-Beijing stance after the incident, said Professor Jeffrey Ordaniel, a fellow at Hawaii-based foreign policy research institute Pacific Forum. “The Duterte administration’s China policy is unfortunately helping the Chinese pursue their maritime ambitions.”
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang described the incident as an “accidental collision"" at briefing on Monday, adding that politicizing the collision “is not appropriate.” Beijing’s embassy in Manila earlier said the Chinese vessel’s captain tried to rescue the Philippine fishermen after bumping into their boat, but was afraid of being ""besieged"" by other Filipino fishing boats.
The incident took place near Reed Bank, an area claimed by both Manila and Beijing where there’s a pending oil exploration plan by Philippines company PXP Energy Corp.

Pebble Beach, Calif. (AP) -- An impossible par from the rough. An improbable birdie from a divot.
If Gary Woodland can handle whatever comes his way this weekend as well as he did Friday, he might be holding a trophy at the end of the U.S. Open.
Woodland brought his power game to the majors once again, shooting 6-under 65 to head into the weekend at 9 under and with a two-shot lead over Justin Rose.
The 65 matched the record for a U.S. Open at Pebble Beach — a number previously shot by Rose on Thursday, and Tiger Woods 19 years ago.
For Woodland, the feat appeared virtually undoable as he lined up a chip from the deep rough just past the canyon that separates the eighth fairway and green — his second-to-last hole. He made a delicate chip to 15 feet, then sank the putt to save par and give him momentum heading to No. 9.
""That's one you're hoping to get close, but it's nice when it goes in,"" Woodland said.
Pumped from that make, he hit a 316-yard drive into the middle of the fairway on the 526-yard par-4 ninth. Perfect, except it came to rest in a divot. Woodland grabbed 7-iron, gouged it out to the right side of the green — then made that 50-footer to take a two-shot lead over Rose.
""It was a nice putt to go in, and kind of keep the momentum going,"" Woodland said.
That birdie dropped him to a cumulative 22-under par in the first two rounds of the last four majors. He had the lead heading into the weekend in one of those majors — the 2018 PGA at Bellerive — and played Saturday with Brooks Koepka and Sunday with Woods.
But it turned out to be a bit too much. Woodland shot 71-69 over the weekend and finished in a tie for sixth.
""You learn you have to stay within yourself. You can't get caught up in what's going on around you,"" he said. ""Obviously there's a lot more noise going on. Playing with Tiger on Sunday, I'd never seen anything like that.""
Tiger won't be anywhere near him at Pebble Beach on Saturday. He finished with a pair of bogeys to shoot 72 and finished at even-par — still among the 79 players to make it through to the weekend, but with tons of room to make up and not much time to do it.
""We've got a long way to go, and we'll see how it shapes up for tomorrow,"" Woods said.
There were 10 players within five shots of the lead, including Koepka, in search of his third straight title, and Rory McIlroy, who made double-bogey on No. 14 after failing to hit the green with wedge on two straight shots. But he followed that with back-to-back birdies to finish at 5 under.
""I didn't quite get those three shots back, but 2 under for the last four after what happened, I'm very pleased with it,"" McIlroy said.
He was one of 31 players to finish under par after a second consecutive day of calm wind and cloudy skies that brought an occasional thin mist across the course.
Pleasant enough, though not everyone enjoyed their trip around Pebble Beach.
Patrick Reed flubbed a chip at the right of the 18th green and snapped his wedge over his thigh. He made double-bogey there to make the cut on the number, at 2 over.
Francesco Molinari was cruising at 5 under before he put one in the canyon on No. 8 — the start of a double-bogey-bogey finish that left him tied for 19th, at 2 under.
""I liked it more before the last two holes,"" Molinari said, when asked about his position.
Woodland liked his position best.
But it's the U.S. Open. Nobody can feel too comfortable.

China’s preliminary investigation showed that Chinese fishing vessel Yuemaobinyu 42212 from Guangdong province was engaged in a “light purse seine operation” about midnight on June 9 when it was suddenly besieged by seven or eight Filipino fishing boats, according to a statement posted on the Twitter account of the Chinese embassy in Manila.
The Philippines this week filed a diplomatic protest against China after it said the crew of a Chinese fishing boat sank a Filipino vessel carrying 22 fishermen in South China Sea, an incident seen as potentially inflaming a dispute calmed by warm ties between the nations’ leaders.

Philippine Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio called on the Filipino people to take a strong stand against what he views as latest aggressive act of China. The incident may signal the start of a “new gray zone offensive” by China to drive away Filipino fishing vessels in the South China Sea, he said.
“The ramming of F/B Gimver I is a quantum escalation of China’s aggressive acts against the Philippines in the West Philippine Sea,” Carpio said in a statement.
In its statement, China said one of the Filipino boats in Reed Bank in the South China Sea tilted and its stern foundered after being bumped by the Chinese vessel’s steel cable. “The Chinese captain tried to rescue the Filipino fishermen but was afraid of being besieged by other Filipino fishing boats,” it said. “There is no such thing as hit-and-run.”
The statement was posted on Friday on the embassy’s Facebook account and was removed hours later, before being re-posted on Twitter Saturday after a play-up from the local media.
Two Philippine opposition lawmakers on Saturday expressed doubts over China’s statement. Senator Risa Hontiveros said it is China’s attempt at a cover-up to shield the involved Chinese crew from any accountability. Congressman Gary Alejano, a former navy officer, called China’s claims ridiculous, saying Filipinos wouldn’t have dared besiege a Chinese vessel knowing China’s presence in South China Sea.

Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin said on his personal Twitter account Thursday he had “fired off a diplomatic protest yesterday” on the incident, which he said in another tweet he’d call a ""hit and run.""
President Rodrigo Duterte’s spokesman, Salvador Panelo, described the act of China’s fishing vessel on June 9 as uncivilized, outrageous and barbaric in what could be the most serious flare-up between Manila and Beijing in three years. Panelo also urged China to investigate and sanction the crew members, supporting the call of Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who said diplomatic steps should be taken.
“The captain and the crew of the Chinese vessel should not have left the injured party without any assistance. Such act of desertion is inhuman,” Panelo said in a statement, adding the Chinese crew violated international protocols that require them to assist a vessel in distress.
Despite the tough talk from multiple officials, Lorenzana appeared to soften his stance Thursday, saying the government had yet to determine if the vessel was indeed from China.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, speaking at a regular briefing in Beijing, referred to it as an ordinary maritime traffic accident that can be dealt with by proper channels. He blamed the media for hyping up the issue.
The U.S. urged China to refrain from coercion and intimidation in the South China Sea.
""China’s efforts to assert its expansive and unlawful maritime claims -- including by using coercion and intimidation against other claimants and users of the SCS, undermines the stability of the region,"" a State Department spokesman said by email.
At a briefing on Thursday, Panelo said these incidents could affect ties between China and the Philippines and that the government would consider it an act of aggression if the collision was intentional. Duterte may decide to minimize ties or even opt for a more severe response if the issue escalates, his spokesman said.
""Beijing will have to cope with the chorus of outcry from the Philippine public,"" said Collin Koh, a maritime security research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ""The pressure from this incident looks set to heap upon the Duterte administration to seek accountability from Beijing.""

Since Duterte’s election in mid-2016, the Philippines has pivoted toward China, mending ties that deteriorated from 2012 when the Philippine Navy apprehended a group of Chinese fishing frigates at the Scarborough Shoal, a reef approximately 120 nautical miles west of the Philippine island of Luzon.
The dispute led the Philippines, then under former President Benigno Aquino, to file a case before an international tribunal, which in July 2016 ruled in its favor and rejected China’s claims. That didn’t stop Beijing from reclaiming portions of the sea and building a defense base in the area.
“The critics of Duterte’s China policy are going to seize on this unfortunate incident to cast a shadow of doubt over his approach to the South China Sea,” said Richard Heydarian, a fellow at the National Chengchi University in Taiwan and author of a book on the president. “This is definitely a soft power disaster for China and could possibly sink Duterte’s ability to convince the people of his approach to Beijing.”
Lorenzana had condemned the crew of the Chinese fishing vessel for abandoning the 22 distressed Filipinos aboard FB Gimber 1, who were later rescued by a Vietnamese fishing boat and a Philippine Navy ship.
The incident took place near Reed Bank, an area claimed by both Manila and Beijing where there’s a pending oil exploration plan by Philippines company PXP Energy Corp. PXP fell for a third day.
The Chinese crew members’ act of leaving the area as the Philippine boat was sinking indicates they hit the vessel intentionally, said Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Penetrante, spokesman for the military unit in charge of the disputed waters. “It is far from accidental, because if it is, they should have stopped and rescued our fishermen,” he said on Wednesday. A statement from the same military unit on Thursday however said the Chinese vessel “accidentally collided” with the Philippine boat.
China asserts control over more than 80% of the South China Sea, a key shipping route also claimed by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Of all the key moments in Jack Welch’s storied tenure as General Electric Co.’s chief executive officer, there’s one that’s always overlooked. It took place on Friday, Aug. 13, 1982.
Although he’d been CEO for only 16 months, the 46-year-old Welch had already put his stamp on the place. He was blowing up the bureaucracy, eliminating the formalized meetings that had long marked GE’s culture, and installing a blunter, more freewheeling style that prioritized “facing realities” over “superficial congeniality,” as Welch later put it in Jack: Straight From the Gut. He was beginning to execute on his famous dictum that if a GE business wasn’t first or second in its market, it should be sold, fixed, or closed. (In his first two years, Welch sold 71 businesses.) And though he wasn’t yet known as Neutron Jack, the large-scale layoffs that would earn him that nickname were well under way.
Yet the stock market had barely noticed. GE’s shares were actually down 5% during that period, and investors still viewed the company as a dividend play. Then came Aug. 13. That, we know now, was the first day of a powerful bull market, one that would see the S&P 500 index return more than 2,400% by the time it ended 18 years later. Once the bull began running, GE’s stock went in only one direction: up. By the end of 1983, it had returned more than 90%; within five years, 237%. A sprawling, century-old conglomerate had become, improbably, a growth stock.
There’s no question that Welch was a brilliant and forward-thinking chief executive. With one big exception (GE’s acquisition of Kidder, Peabody & Co.), everything he touched seemed to turn to gold. Even as General Motors, U.S. Steel, Eastman Kodak, and other companies lost market share to foreign competitors, Welch’s GE was making inroads internationally. He turned GE Capital from a ho-hum ­consumer-finance arm—underwriting loans for, say, GE refrigerators—into an immense generator of profits. He was one of the first CEOs to reward his top executives with stock options—lots and lots of stock options, making many of them millionaires. He also believed that the mediocre should go elsewhere if they didn’t improve quickly, and he acted on that belief. When Welch adopted Six Sigma, a set of processes designed to create continuous improvement, half the CEOs in the Fortune 500 raced to adopt it as well. Under Welch, GE became famous for developing outstanding managers, men (always men) such as W. James McNerney Jr., Lawrence Bossidy, and David Cote, all of whom became CEOs of important industrial companies.
So, yes, Jack Welch was really good. But he was also lucky. According to Fortune magazine’s Geoffrey Colvin, in a story he wrote near the end of Welch’s tenure, Welch tossed aside GE’s historic ambition—“simply to grow faster than the ­economy”—and replaced it with a new mission: “to be the world’s most valuable company.” In other words, Welch redirected GE’s focus on share-price appreciation at the exact moment the greatest bull market of our lifetime was starting.
Prior to August 1982, the men who ran America’s big companies didn’t spend a whole lot of time worrying about their stock price. For one thing, CEOs weren’t measured by how well the stock did. For another, the business world had largely given up on equities. Nothing typified that more than that infamous 1979 BusinessWeek cover, “The Death of Equities.”
Consider Reg Jones, Welch’s predecessor. In his day, Jones was widely considered the country’s best CEO, even though GE’s stock dropped 21% during his nine years at the helm. When he died in 2004, the New York Times attributed the stock’s poor performance to “investor disenchantment with stocks generally, rather than the company’s operations.”
The bull market changed all that. The creation of 401(k)s and IRAs meant the stock market was suddenly important to Americans saving for retirement. Corporate raiders such as T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn began demanding that companies start paying attention to shareholders. And executives themselves realized that a rising stock price could make them wealthy thanks to the stock options that became part of every CEO’s compensation package. Suddenly, nothing mattered more than stock performance.
Welch partisans will tell you that GE’s shares didn’t just rise in lockstep with the S&P 500; they absolutely obliterated the index. That’s true: GE’s total return during Welch’s 20 years was about 5,200%, more than double that of the S&P 500. GE’s revenue grew from $25 billion to $130 billion while its profits grew tenfold, to $15 billion.
“Jack was one of the finest managers I’ve ever met,” billionaire investor and former GE director Ken Langone told CNBC last year. “Every 90 days he would meet with all his different business segments and drill down. He knew everything about his businesses.”
“Jack changed the rules of the game,” says John A. Byrne, who for years wrote about Welch when he was on the BusinessWeek staff. “He was the first CEO to lay off workers while the company was still profitable. There were people who hated him for it. But if he hadn’t done it, GE wouldn’t have thrived.”
“He motivated. He inspired,” says Paul Argenti, a longtime business professor and Welch observer at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business. “He was great at defining and executing a strategy. And changing it when it needed to change. He was the consummate leader of his time.”
I don’t disagree with any of that. But I also recall another reason Wall Street was so enamored of Welch: Quarter after quarter, this huge, unwieldy conglomerate beat the Street’s earnings estimates by a penny or two. Given the ups and downs of business, it was an almost miraculous feat. The profit GE Capital generated was only one of the reasons Welch valued it so much. The other reason was that it was GE’s black box. It gave him the means to dispense those quarterly miracles.
Argenti says he doesn’t think Welch’s methods would work today. “Beating by a penny has gone away,” he told me. Today’s employees tend to respond best to a different kind of leadership—quieter and less self-promotional, as exemplified by Tim Cook at Apple Inc., say, or Reed Hastings at Netflix Inc.

Still, by the time Welch retired in September 2001, he was widely hailed as the greatest CEO of his time, maybe of all time. Fortune named him manager of the century; BusinessWeek gave him and his wife, Suzy, a column. But it seems to me that GE’s deterioration during Jeff Immelt’s time as chief executive officer should cause us to question whether such accolades were truly deserved.
One issue is whether the conglomerate structure Welch turned over to Immelt was sustainable. Take GE Capital again. Immelt critics point out that he depended on it for profits even more than Welch did. But a good part of the reason for this is that the business climate Immelt operated in was far more difficult than anything Welch ever faced. The 2008 financial crisis exposed how woefully undercapitalized GE Capital was. It had far too many substandard loans on its books, as it stretched for profits that were harder to come by. Would Welch have prevented the fall of GE Capital? Maybe. But it was he who created the dependence on that division in the first place.
The second issue has to do with the larger business culture. Yes, hundreds of other CEOs adopted Six Sigma after Welch did. But they also bought into his obsession with the stock price. At its worst, that obsession gave us Enron Corp. and WorldCom. But even putting crookedness aside, it led most of corporate America to care primarily about dancing to Wall Street’s tune. Employees, communities, and even customers became less important than “maximizing shareholder value.”
Then there’s the question of Welch’s successor, Immelt. Welch now claims that Immelt fooled him—that he gave the impression of being a better leader than he turned out to be. But c’mon. Immelt joined GE in 1982; Welch had almost two decades to size him up. If one of the most important jobs of a CEO is to pick his successor—and it is—then Welch failed.
A year after Welch retired, BusinessWeek asked the great management thinker Jim Collins whether Welch was a “Level 5” leader, Collins’s highest accolade for a CEO. He responded: “His report card does not come in until Immelt exceeds him. If Immelt does not exceed him, then he has failed. Jack Welch did not make GE great. GE was already great. Every GE CEO has been to his era what Welch was to his, without exception. It takes 50 years to create a GE. Generations of leaders built it. Whether Welch was a Level 5 comes down to a question we don’t know the answer to. Was Welch first and foremost ambitious for himself or for GE? Only he knows that.”
Here’s one other thing. As I noted earlier, the great bull market ended on March 24, 2000. Tech companies such as Pets.com imploded. Solid companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. saw their stock price fall by three-quarters, and they still ­haven’t fully recovered.
Jack Welch’s GE wasn’t immune. From March 24, 2000, to Sept. 6, 2001, when Welch retired, GE’s shares fell 24%. Was he managing any differently? No. Had he lost his touch when it came to earnings? No, again. The only thing that had changed is that the market was going down instead of up. Even Welch couldn’t defy a bear market.
Was Jack Welch a great manager? Of course he was. But the bull market—and the culture’s new emphasis on share price—made him look better than he really was. And by the way, the greatest manager of the 20th century was Alfred P. Sloan, who ran General Motors Co. from 1923 to 1956. But that’s a story for another day.

London is beaten when the award goes to a centuries-old hotel and restaurant in the northern countryside.
Turnip and crab at Moor Hall.
A restaurant deep in the countryside of northern England has been named the best in the U.K., beating some of the biggest names in gastronomy and leaving high-profile London rivals in its wake. 
Chef Mark Birchall opened Moor Hall Restaurant With Rooms in 2017 and it has already become a destination, though it is 215 miles (346 kilometers) from the capital. It takes first place in the Estrella Damm National Restaurant Awards, which ranks the U.K. Top 100.
The next four places are all taken by London chefs. Second is Brat, Tomos Parry’s Basque-influenced restaurant in Shoreditch. Third is a new entry, Tom Brown’s modern-British Cornerstone, in Hackney Wick.  Fourth is Core by Clare Smyth, a two-Michelin starred establishment in Notting Hill.  And fifth is Sabor, a Spanish restaurant in Mayfair. 
The list is compiled from the votes of 150 U.K. chefs, restaurateurs and food writers. I am a voter. Restaurant magazine is published by William Reed, the group behind the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards. Neither Gordon Ramsay nor Alain Ducasse, high-profile international chefs with London restaurants, makes the list, which tends to highlight new restaurants over classic establishments.
Le Gavroche and the Waterside Inn are among those missing.
Moor Hall is set in five acres (two hectares) of gardens in a house of mid-16th-century origins in rural Aughton, Lancashire. The food is more than a match for the beautiful setting. Birchall has already won two Michelin stars for dishes that may include smoked eel with potato, fermented garlic, flowers; fallow deer with elderberry, beetroot and kale; and gingerbread with roots and pine.
The four-course lunch menu costs £65 ($82), while eight courses are £125. I visited last year and it is a deserving winner. The wine list is adventurous, too. There are, for example, 20 whites by the glass, including options from Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
“Mark is an incredibly talented chef who has a clear ambition to not just create one of the best restaurants in the U.K. but in the world,” says Stefan Chomka, editor of Restaurant magazine.
This year sees three female chefs place in the Top 10: Clare Smyth for Core; Nieves Barragan for Sabor; and Monica Galetti for Mere.In total, 46 of the Top 100 restaurants are located outside of London.
Other awards, announced at the Hurlingham Club on Monday night include Chef of the Year: Clare Smyth; Restaurateur of the Year: Tom and Michaela Kitchin; and Lifetime Achievement: John Williams of the Ritz.

President Donald Trump’s trade wars have already wiped out all but $100 of the average American household’s windfall from Trump’s 2017 tax law. And that’s just the beginning.
That last $100 in tax-cut gains also could soon disappear -- and then some -- because of additional tariffs Trump has announced or is considering. If the president makes good on his threats to impose levies on virtually all imports from China and Mexico, those middle-earning households could pay nearly $4,000 more as they shell out more for a vast range of goods -- from avocados to iPhones.
Subtract the tax cut, and the average household will effectively be paying about $3,000 more a year in additional costs.
“It’s giving with one hand and taking with the other,” said Kim Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, who’s written a book promoting free trade.
Here’s how the math works: middle earners got an average tax cut of $930 for the tax overhaul passed in late 2017, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The tariffs already in effect cost the average household about $831, according to research from the New York Federal Reserve.
Add in the additional tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese goods that Trump proposed in May, and is still considering, and that increases the cost for an average family of four to about $2,294 annually, according to research from “Tariffs Hurt the Heartland,” a coalition of business groups.
Trump has also threatened to levy tariffs on all imports from Mexico, starting with a 5% tax beginning as soon as Monday that would increase monthly to 25% in October unless Mexico curbs illegal migration to the president’s satisfaction.
If the tariffs reach their highest level, the annual cost to households would increase by $1,700, according to Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the centrist Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The full force of the Chinese and Mexican tariffs and subsequent retaliation would mean that consumers are facing an additional $3,994 in costs because of tariffs, more than four times the $930 tax cut for middle earners that the Republican Party touts as its signature legislative achievement under Trump.
These comparisons attempt to measure the direct benefit to households of the tax cuts -- including larger paychecks -- with the direct and indirect effects of tariffs, including lost jobs, higher prices, and retaliatory tariffs from trading partners.
The majority of the average annual tax cut for middle earners has been eroded by the cost of higher import tariffs already in effect.

The tariffs are “clearly demolishing” the benefits of the tax cuts for both businesses and consumers, said Daniel Ikenson, who directs trade policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. “Many households and consumers have been spared so far, but the next round of tariffs will be more problematic.”

In the beginning of the trade dispute, Trump and his advisers sought to put tariffs on products that consumers don’t directly buy, such as steel and aluminum. But as the trade feud with China has escalated, they ran out of non-consumer goods on which to put levies. The most recent round of announced tariffs includes consumer products, such as apparel, sporting goods and kitchen ware.
Trump has disputed that American companies and consumers pay higher prices because of the tariffs placed on the imports they buy. He has said tariffs are beneficial because the levies are paid to the U.S. Treasury. “No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking in Billions!” he said in a tweet Friday.
Trump’s most recent threat on all imports from Mexico would increase prices on cars and auto parts, televisions, phones and air conditioners, as well as produce including avocados, citrus fruits and pineapples.
Only the top 5% of earners would continue to see a net tax cut of more than 1%, according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation. Tariffs would also depress wages by about 0.5% and result in the loss of nearly 610,000 full-time jobs, according to the foundation.
That creates political problems for Republicans in Congress who’ve continued to back Trump even as they disagreed with his trade policies. Republicans have cited the passage of the tax-cut law, low unemployment rates and wage increases as signs that Trump’s policies have buoyed the economy. But there are signs that support is beginning to fracture.
The tax cuts “vaulted America back into the most competitive economy,” said Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who led the passage of the tax cut legislation in the House. “Higher tariffs and the uncertainty that comes with trade disputes"" hurt the economy, he said.
The full force of Trump's enacted and planned tariffs on goods from China and Mexico amount to more than four times the size of the tax cut for middle-earners.
Sources: Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, Peterson Institute for International Economics

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged the administration this week to delay imposing the tariffs on Mexico until Republicans in Congress could plead their case to Trump. Most Senate Republicans have objected to Trump using tariffs to force tougher border enforcement by Mexico. Lawmakers are weighing moves to block the levies.
“This is a man-made disaster, because Donald Trump is not focused in any way on advancing a well-thought-out doctrine,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a top Democrat from New York. “He seems to be carrying out at times personal vendettas, at other times political objectives and sometimes an effort to distract from the news of the day.”
The effects of tariffs have yet to become noticeable to average consumers. That could soon change. The tariffs on goods from Mexico are slated to go into effect Monday, barring a last-minute deal between Mexican and U.S. negotiators. The Chinese tariffs targeting consumer goods could go into effect in the coming months.
U.S. and Mexican negotiators planned a third day of talks on Friday to try to reach an agreement that would avert the tariffs. Mexico is pushing for more time, but Vice President Mike Pence and other officials said the U.S. plans to impose tariffs on Monday.
“It’s not like all of sudden prices will jump 25%, but they could increase 10% or 11%,” said Brian Yarbrough, a senior equity analyst at Edward Jones, said of tariffs of 25% or more. “At some point, price increases will choke off demand, resulting in fewer sales.”
Republicans are hoping to campaign in 2020 on the message of a strong economy buoyed by their tax reductions and deregulation, which began two years ago. But the fresh sting of tariffs risk erasing any economic goodwill those policies generated.
“For the average household it will be a net loss, no doubt,” the Peterson Institutes’s Hufbauer said. “It will be painful.”"

The Super Bowl and the Lunar New Year (China, Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam closed to commemorate the Year of the Pig) are tag-teaming equity markets to suppress any real early action this morning, with S&P futures effectively unchanged, a situation that it feels like has been the case for the better part of a week or two.
It was understandable last week when one would be justified in laying off risk until major catalysts were fully digested, but this week should shape up to be notably less volatile on that front. Crude is the notable actor early, with European majors (Shell, BP) accounting for much of the gains in the FTSE 100. WTI is holding above $55, which may help the U.S. energy names that led the S&P Friday.
But earnings are still in focus for the week, with Alphabet the first major report on the docket after the close today. We’ll see if their results too, can come in ""better than feared,"" to help recover some of the losses seen in late 2018. Though a player in the cloud segment like AMZN and MSFT, advertising is still king, and analysts are looking at Facebook’s better-than-expected result last week as a positive read through for the search engine.
About half of the S&P 500 has reported results for the season, and there’s a little bit for the bulls and the bears to take home, whether you’re in the ""better than feared"" camp, or just looking at the magnitude of the beats. Sixty percent of companies have beat on the top line, while nearly 3/4 have beat on earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

And Citi analysts led by Tobias Levkovich write that they still see a preference from investors for growth instead of value. Its hard to argue with that preference after the payrolls figure Friday appeared to hit the sweet spot (allaying growth slowdown fears while keeping inflation (and the Fed) at bay). The next question will be whether the 10-year yield continues its rally after Friday’s gains were some of the largest in nearly a month, potentially adding pressure to stocks.

Two cannabis entrepreneurs who sold their first pot company to Canopy Growth Corp. for C$430 million ($324 million) hit pay dirt again after their cannabis-brand company surged in its trading debut.
Slang Worldwide Inc., co-founded by Peter Miller and Billy Levy, began trading Tuesday on the Canadian Securities Exchange through a direct listing. The stock jumped 19 percent to C$1.79 at 10:16 a.m. after listing at C$1.50, giving the company a market value of about C$645 million. That’s more valuable than Mettrum Health Corp. when Miller and Levy sold it in early 2017 to Canopy, the world’s largest cannabis company.
Unlike Mettrum, Slang won’t be growing pot and it has no plans to open its own retail stores. Instead, it’s focused on brands and distribution, particularly in the U.S. where it’s already in 10 states and plans to be in 10 more before the end of the year. As legalization of recreational pot spreads around the world, cannabis is shifting from an agricultural product to a consumer-packaged good, Miller said.
“The best brands tied to the best distribution networks will ultimately be where the most value is created,” he said in a phone interview.
Slang owns several cannabis brands, including O.penVape, the second-best selling U.S. legal cannabis product with $187 million of sales from 2014 through November 2018, according to data from cannabis research firm BDS Analytics that was shared by Slang. The company, which sells its products in 2,600 stores, reported C$21 million of consolidated revenue in the nine months ended Sept. 30 and a net loss of about C$24 million.
Slang raised C$66 million in a September financing and intends to use the public markets to access the capital it will need to expand into other countries in Europe and Latin America. It will trade under the ticker SLNG.
Miller, a Canadian, and Levy, who’s American, knew little about pot when they founded Mettrum in 2013 to grow medical cannabis in Canada, so they turned to U.S. markets like Colorado where the drug was already legal to learn about best practices.
“We went and developed a lot of expertise and relationships that are now part of Slang, and I think having that cross-border view has been super helpful to put us in the position we’re in today,” Levy said.
Slang has operations in Canada through Agripharm Corp., a licensed cannabis producer that’s 20 percent owned by Slang and 40 percent owned by Spectrum Cannabis Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Canopy.
Canopy has a warrant that allows it to acquire 32 million shares in Slang, or about 15 percent of the company, if the U.S. legalizes cannabis at the federal level. The warrant is tied to a collaboration agreement that would see Canopy and Slang partner on distribution, marketing and research.
“Ultimately we care about one thing and pretty much one thing only, and that’s getting the most servings of cannabis into the world with our brands on them,” Miller said."

An island in the Bahamas that’s home to 50,000 people is 70% under water after Hurricane Dorian battered it with record force for two days, according to the government.
There are “still many outstanding rescue missions,” on the island of Grand Bahama, Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Kevin Peter Turnquest said, in reply to written questions. “It’s not looking good as we expect catastrophic damage.”

Seaports and airports in Grand Bahama and the nearby Abaco Islands are flooded or damaged, complicating the task of rescuing people cut off by flood waters.
The National Emergency Management Agency sent out an “urgent plea” for owners of equipment such as flatbeds, jet skis, small boats, trucks and buses to assemble at a shopping mall on Grand Bahama to help with the rescue operation.
The U.S. Coast Guard and British Royal Navy sent ships to assist.
Boats are damaged at a marina in the Bahamas on Sept. 2.
The storm is now traveling northwest away from the archipelago at nearly 5 miles per hour, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said at 2 p.m. New York time.
It could potentially hit the East Coast of the U.S.
At least five people died in the storm, but National Security Minister Marvin Dames said this figure is likely to rise, and will include some children, according to a report in the Nassau Guardian, a local newspaper.
Humanitarian aid organizations estimate 13,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed in the Bahamas, according to a report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands between them have about 2,250 of the 17,500 hotel rooms in the Bahamas, Resort Capital Partners, a real estate investment advisory firm that covers the region, said in reply to emailed questions.
The severity of the storm impact on Grand Bahama and Abaco over the last two days may be the greatest ever experienced by any populated area in the Atlantic basin, according to Ryan Truchelut, president of Weather Tiger in Tallahassee, Florida.

The S&P/BMV IPC index sank as much as 1.8% in its fifth consecutive decline. The equity gauge, also known as the Mexbol, has slumped 13% from this year’s high in April. Cement maker Cemex SAB, which derives more than three-quarters of its sales from abroad, led declines in Mexico City as global markets were roiled after China escalated the trade war with the U.S.
At the worst of it Monday, the Mexbol traded at its lowest intraday level since last November and was poised to close at its lowest in more than five-years.
“The inertia is going to continue down,” said Monex’s senior technical analyst Juan Caudillo. If the Mexbol were to close below the November low, it could sink an additional 6% before finding support at around 37,000 points, he said.
From a fundamental standpoint, Mexican equities could see further pressure on concerns about slowing growth in Mexico and the economic policies of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said more companies so far have missed second-quarter earnings estimates than have beaten them, which could lead analysts to reduce their expectations even further.

At an event Monday in Helsinki, Yi said he’ll remain cautious in the future because difficulties remain in structural and fundamental issues, though the road map for trade talks agreed by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in Osaka is constructive.
“But as long as the two largest economies have more or less normal trade relationship, we can continue the negotiation, we can solve problems one by one, and we can address each side’s priority concerns better and keep the trade relationship more or less at the working level,” Yi said.
On the domestic economy and policy settings, Yi said the central bank’s interest rates are at a comfortable level, economic growth is close to its potential and the current policy stance is enough to deal with different situations. Yi’s comments signal that policy makers won’t necessarily adopt broader easing measures if the risks from the trade war remain constrained.

China’s economic growth will continue to moderate as labor supply shrinks, local officials place less stress on the growth of gross domestic product and environmental protections get tougher, Yi said during his remarks at an event organized by the Bank of Finland.
Gauges of activity in China’s manufacturing sector in June showed the economy remains fragile, underlining the need for the truce with the U.S. to be a lasting one. Yi pointed to the growing importance of consumption as a driver for growth, and added that he expects the current account surplus to be below 1% of GDP this year.
On debt-related risks, Yi said China’s total debt ratio as a percentage of GDP has stabilized, and it’ll continue to stay stable as long as the central bank can keep broad money supply basically in line with nominal GDP growth. Yi said the PBOC didn’t want to deleverage, but rather to reduce the risks of leverage and keep the growth low.
Yi said last month that there’s “tremendous room” for monetary policy to adjust if the trade war with the U.S. worsens.

At this past week's American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, a new drug from AstraZeneca was shown to slow the spread of a rare pancreatic cancer. Early results from a study of an Amgen drug raised new hopes for lung-cancer patients. Each of those therapies hinges upon cutting-edge genetic research that would have seemed like fantasy a generation ago. 
Leaps in genetic science are also yielding one-shot cures for diseases that once were beyond the grasp of medicine. Gene therapy has appeared to successfully treat incurable patients like Omarion Jordan, whose harrowing ""bubble boy"" disease has been reversed. As science races ahead, these new medical wonders will likely cost patients millions.
Meanwhile, the rewards of a great breakthrough of another era are being eroded. U.S. public-health officials reported that measles cases in the first five months of 2019 topped the total cases per year for the past 25 years. A simple, inexpensive inoculation that spared millions of children from sickness for decades has fallen under uninformed suspicion, with potentially ruinous consequences for society.

At least 21 fires had already occurred at battery projects in South Korea, according to BloombergNEF. But this latest one, erupting on Friday at a facility owned by a Pinnacle West Capital Corp. utility in Surprise, Arizona, marked the first time it has happened in America since batteries took off globally.
Local regulators are now demanding answers, companies are investigating the cause, and analysts are wondering: Could more blazes threaten the future of lithium-ion -- the only technology that has proven capable of bringing battery storage into the mainstream?
“If these fires continue to occur, it doesn’t bode well for the industry in the short term and the storage market will almost certainly slow down,” said Ravi Manghani, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. “As other technologies mature and costs fall, it would certainly erode lithium-ion’s advantage.”
Here’s the issue for lithium-ion: while not inherently dangerous, when handled incorrectly, a potential hazard can occur. The electrolytes used today are flammable in the presence of oxygen, said James Frith, a London-based analyst at BNEF. While batteries are sealed from external sources of oxygen, some cathodes can release oxygen within the cell under high temperatures.
The explosions are coming at an inopportune time for the industry. Nothing has done more to fuel the global battery boom than the plunge in lithium-ion prices. Costs have fallen to a level at which batteries can compete against conventional power plants, and everyone from solar developers to utilities to homeowners are buying them to shore up intermittent renewable energy supplies. Pinnacle West’s Arizona Public Service alone has a goal of adding 850 megawatts of storage by 2025 -- enough to light up more than 600,000 homes at once.
Average prices are down 85% since 2010

Footnote: Lithium-ion battery prices are adjusted to real 2018 dollars
But that goal was set before Friday’s blast. On Tuesday, Arizona Public Service told the state’s utility regulators that it had shut two other battery systems following the explosion, which injured at least four firefighters. While APS hasn’t determined the cause of the accident, spokeswoman Jill Hanks said it probably involved some sort of “equipment failure.” The system being investigated was installed by Fluence, a joint venture of AES Corp. and Siemens.
The company still plans to charge ahead with its battery deployment plans, APS President Jeff Guldner told the Arizona Corporation Commission during the hearing on Tuesday.
Commissioners peppered APS officials at the meeting with questions about the fire-suppression system at the site and asked whether similar incidents have occurred. Jacob Tetlow, vice president of the company’s transmission and distribution operations, noted that there was once a battery failure at a substation in 2012.
Commissioner Sandra Kennedy called for a “thorough investigation” to ensure the protection of residents and businesses in the area.
In Korea, defective battery models, external shock during construction and faulty battery-management systems may have contributed to recent fires at factories, according to Logan Goldie-Scot, a San Francisco-based storage analyst at BNEF.
The blazes at battery plants are hitting just as smaller, lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars are also coming under scrutiny. This week, Tesla Inc. said it was looking into a sedan that caught fire on video in China.
It’s become a potential selling point for rivals of lithium-ion. Tom Stepien, chief executive officer of Primus Power Corp., a battery company that uses a technology known as flow, was quick to note lithium-ion’s “inherent fire risks” after Friday’s accident. It’s for that very reason, he said, that people are warned at airports not to carry such batteries onto planes.
There is a “wide opening -- a pantheon of new technologies that are aiming to beat lithium-ion from both a performance and cost perspective,” said Jeff Chamberlain, CEO of Volta Energy Technologies, an Exelon Corp.-backed company that evaluates and tests new energy-storage applications.
Lithium-ion will be a powerful incumbent to beat. The technology has made up more than 85 percent of the world’s annual energy-storage deployments since 2016, according to BloombergNEF. And other battery technologies carry their own potential hazards.
Just before the fire broke out in Arizona, a coalition of battery makers, installers and utilities announced a task force to establish a set of safety best practices for the industry.
“The U.S. energy storage market nearly doubled in 2018 and is expected to double again in 2019,” Energy Storage Association Chief Executive Officer Kelly Speakes-Backman said in a statement about the task force. “This marks an ideal time for the industry to demonstrate their commitment to corporate responsibility.”

U.S. regulators plan to revamp rules governing how medicines are manufactured, in an effort to ensure the safety of the nation's drug supply as recalls of contaminated imports from developing countries widen.
“We’ve seen a lot of instances of adulterated products — contamination, impurities — recently,” said Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who plans to leave his post next month, in an interview. “The underlying causes have been traced back to manufacturing, inadequate quality controls and generally poor management oversight.”
A Bloomberg investigation this year found that manufacturers of generic drugs and their key ingredients in China, India and elsewhere, had in some cases destroyed or hidden testing data revealing quality failures from official records — and showed passing results instead. The FDA wants to force drugmakers to do more rigorous testing to make sure that pills used by millions of Americans meets basic safety and effectiveness standards.
Currently, the FDA mostly relies on the industry to police itself, only sporadically inspecting manufacturing sites. That approach has been strained by the increasing proportion of generic drugs and drug ingredients made for the U.S. market in countries like China and India, where the regulator has few boots on the ground.
The proposed rule changes will focus on the raw materials used to produce drugs. Active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, are basic building blocks that make drugs effective against diseases and disorders. If they don’t meet certain specifications for strength and purity, then the medicines made from them may not work — or may even cause harm. Gottlieb said the overhaul is in its early stages and may take several years to complete.
More than a dozen companies have recalled drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers in the past eight months for containing three different potential carcinogens. One of the most widely used is valsartan, which can be taken on its own or with others to treat hypertension or heart failure. The contaminated active ingredients were bought by drugmakers who used them in pills sold in the U.S.
 Read more: Bloomberg’s report on generic-drug quality
Since the adulterated heart pills first turned up last July, more medicines have been pulled. Most recently, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Hetero Drugs Ltd. and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. — all based in India — recalled additional cardiovascular drugs for containing probable carcinogens earlier this month. Representatives for the companies couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
Western pharmaceutical companies have been increasingly outsourcing the making of active ingredients to India and China, where labor and other expenses are lower and U.S. regulators have less visibility. Drugmakers don’t have to say where they buy active ingredients, though the FDA has said that 80 percent come from outside of the U.S.
At the same time, production issues with active ingredients have increased. Since 2015, the FDA has issued more than 282 warning letters to pharmaceutical companies related to manufacturing problems, according to data on the agency’s website. Of those, 70 involved active pharmaceutical ingredients. The numbers don’t include instances when companies were reproached for quality issues but were allowed to fix problems themselves without an official warning.
One of the problems with active ingredients is highlighted in a warning letter the FDA sent Pfizer Inc. concerning the drug giant’s Hospira facility in the state of Tamil Nadu, near the southernmost tip of India.
Among other complaints, the FDA said that the facility failed to report accurate results for quality checks on batches of certain active ingredients. The FDA redacted the number of batches involved, but said drugs that had received passing scores from the company then failed quality checks when retested in front of FDA inspectors.
“Your quality system does not adequately ensure the accuracy and integrity of data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugs you manufacture,” the agency said in the warning.
The FDA banned Hospira’s plant from sending drugs to the U.S. in August, four months after it inspected it.
Pfizer paused manufacturing at the Hospira facility after the inspection and then decided in January to cease production at the site, the company said in an emailed statement. The decision wasn’t due to the warning letter but was based on “significant long-term loss of product demand that makes manufacturing at this site unviable,” Pfizer said.
The FDA’s monitoring of drug-manufacturing problems has drawn scrutiny from Congress, as well. The House Energy and Commerce Committee began looking into the agency’s manufacturing oversight after Bloomberg’s investigation revealed that surveillance inspections declined 11 percent in fiscal 2018 from a year earlier. The checks are used to make sure plants measure up to U.S. standards.
Gottlieb has previously defended the agency’s approach to inspections, saying it reflects a smarter, more surgical line of attack that targets facilities based on a risk score calculated by the FDA.
In addition to an enhanced self-testing regime, the FDA wants tougher water-purification requirements, Gottlieb said in the interview. Water is used in sterile-injectable drugs and to mix ingredients used in pills, and if it falls short of cleanliness standards it can introduce contaminants.
The FDA last updated its manufacturing standards in 2008, meaning the agency has had to play catch-up with a fast-changing industry. Indian companies accounted for 38 percent of FDA drug approvals in 2018 through October 30, up from 33 percent in 2015, according to Morris Borenstein, a senior analyst at Moody’s. Over the same span, Chinese drugmakers accounted for 8 percent of approvals, up from 1 percent, Borenstein said.
Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower who helped the U.S. show systemic data-integrity problems at Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. facilities in India that led to a $500 million settlement in 2013, said updating the standards is a good move but questioned how the FDA can trust companies.
In a March 2017 visit to a Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. plant in Andhra Pradesh, near India’s southeastern coast, two FDA inspectors caught employees deleting computer files and lists of recent documents to avoid detection of what inspectors said appeared to be manufacturing records. Company officials initially denied that workers had destroyed data but capitulated when pressed by inspectors.
Dr. Reddy’s didn’t receive a warning letter after the inspection, but did receive one for a 2015 inspection of the plant. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.
“What puts the fear of god in them if you misrepresent to the FDA, if you say things that are not true?” Thakur asked. “Where is the accountability? I honestly don’t know how effective it’s going to be.”
Gottlieb, who will be succeeded on an acting basis by Ned Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, said the overhaul was a big deal and that the agency has “gotten a lot more sophisticated on data integrity.”
“It’s a significant modernization for the requirements that haven’t been changed in years,” Gottlieb said.

The Taliban is seeking the pullout of all foreign troops from Afghanistan within months, a senior official said, as the fundamentalist Islamic movement reached out to opponents of U.S.-backed President Ashraf Ghani at talks in Moscow.
“This is the first step,’’ Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanikzai told reporters in the Russian capital after meeting with other Afghan factions. “It will continue in the future with the hope that it can bring peace one day to Afghanistan.”
Ghani’s administration shunned the Feb. 5-6 Russian-hosted initiative, which came after the U.S. announced it was close to reaching a framework agreement with the Taliban on ending the 18-year Afghan war, including on the withdrawal of foreign troops.
The Afghan government is worrying openly that the U.S. will leave them at the mercy of the Taliban. The militant group, which is on the offensive and already controls or contests about half of territory in Afghanistan, refuses to hold talks with the authorities in Kabul until it reaches a binding deal on the pullout of foreign troops, including 14,000 from the U.S.
At talks last month, the Taliban agreed with the U.S. on the withdrawal of “all foreign troops from Afghanistan” and “that the soil of Afghanistan would not be used against them,” said Stanikzai. Now the exact timetable for the pullout must be decided, but the Taliban wants to see this happen in months, he said.
Taliban representative Abdul Salaam Hanifi told reporters Wednesday on the sidelines of Moscow meeting that the agreement involved the withdrawal of half the American troops by the end of April. 
However Khalilzad rejected that, tweeting on Thursday: ""I’ve heard some individual Taliban officials claim we have a troop withdrawal timetable for Afghanistan. Today, they correctly retracted that claim. To be clear: no troop withdrawal timetable exists.""
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he’ll reduce the American military presence in Afghanistan. Among U.S. demands is a commitment by the Taliban to stop terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State from continuing to use Afghanistan as a base of operations. After losing more than 2,300 soldiers and spending more than $900 billion in the country since 2001, critics say the U.S. risks losing hard-won gains.
While Ghani’s government declined to attend the Moscow meeting, organized by an association of Afghans in Russia with the help of the Russian Foreign Ministry, several leading political rivals did. These included former president Hamid Karzai, ex-national security chief Haneef Atmar and an ally of Afghan Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah. Both Abdullah and Atmar are running in the presidential elections scheduled for July against Ghani.
Karzai praised the dialogue with the Taliban and said the government “needs to be part of these negotiations.”"
