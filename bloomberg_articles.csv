A 17-year-old Israeli girl was killed in a terrorist attack near the West Bank settlement of Dolev, Israeli officials said. Her father and brother were also injured in the blast.
The attack Friday morning comes amid heightened tensions between Palestinians and Israelis in the lead up to Israel’s national elections next month, and against the backdrop of a broader financial dispute between the two sides that has left the Palestinian Authority struggling to pay employees.
The Israel Defense Forces said three Israeli civilians were hurt in the blast from an improvised explosive device while they were at a spring near Dolev, about 19 kilometers (12 miles) north of Jerusalem. Emergency services said the girl had died and two men, aged 46 and 20, were described as being in a serious condition.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed condolences to the family, while reiterating his government’s commitment to the settlements -- a key part of his campaign strategy ahead of the national poll on Sept. 17.
Israeli troops are blocking routes and boosting their presence in the area as officers assess the situation. Netanyahu said security forces are in pursuit of the “abhorrent terrorists.”
Tensions have been exacerbated in Israel this year as the financial plight of Palestinians worsened. The Israeli government began withholding about $11 million a month, or roughly 5% of what it collects in tax on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. Israel said the money was being used to pay stipends to families of Palestinians shot dead by Israeli security forces -- some after they had killed Israeli citizens -- or to families of those held in Israeli prisons.
Palestinian officials, who describe the payments as welfare for families of jailed relatives, had refused to accept any funds unless they received the taxes in full. But on Thursday, the PA said it would make a special salary payment to government staff after reaching an agreement with Israel that meant it had more to spend.
Attacks against Israelis have intensified in recent weeks. The daily Haaretz newspaper reported this week that security agencies were increasingly concerned over an outbreak of violence before Israel’s election.

1,ADOM,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-25/gaza-strip-rocket-hits-home-wounds-family-in-central-israel,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-25/gaza-strip-rocket-hits-home-wounds-family-in-central-israel,"March 25, 2019, 1:29 AM EDT",Israel Launches Strikes Across Gaza After Day of Rocket Fire,"Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip on Monday evening, following a tense day that began with a rocket attack on a home in central Israel and a counterstrike that reduced the office of Hamas’s leader to ruins.
Amid the escalation, both sides made preparations for the possibility of a broader confrontation. Israel moved troops closer to its southern border and declared closed military zones near Gaza. Reserves were called up, additional Iron Dome missile-defense batteries were deployed and bomb shelters were opened, including in Tel Aviv.
Television reports showed near-empty streets in southern Israeli communities. In Gaza, hospitals across the territory were put on an emergency footing.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Washington for a speech and meetings with President Donald Trump, called the initial strike, which injured seven people in a village 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Gaza, a “criminal attack on the state of Israel” and vowed to “respond forcefully.” Netanyahu initially was expected to cut his visit to Washington short, though it wasn’t clear later if he would follow through on that.
The conflict overshadowed Trump’s decision on Monday to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, reversing decades of U.S. policy with a presidential proclamation. A major military escalation could prove risky for Netanyahu, who is facing a tough re-election battle on April 9 amid a wide-ranging corruption scandal.
“It highlights an area that he’s perceived as not having delivered the results,” said Israel Democracy Institute President Yohanan Plesner. “The political impact of this Gaza escalation is also that it draws the attention away from the Trump recognition of the Golan Heights that was supposed to be an important moment in his campaign.”
If he stays in Washington, Netanyahu will likely address the annual America Israel Public Affairs Committee conference on Tuesday, as he was originally scheduled to do.
Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, late Monday night reported that the two sides had reached a cease-fire agreement through Egyptian mediation, although airstrikes and rocket fire continued. Netanyahu’s office, the Foreign Ministry and the Israeli army all declined to comment on the cease-fire claim, as they customarily do.
A damaged house after it was hit by a rocket north of Tel Aviv on March 25.
Attacks on Israel have escalated since Hamas suppressed recent protests against living conditions in the coastal enclave, which is groaning under Israeli and Egyptian blockades, sanctions imposed by the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, and Hamas taxes.
Weekly protests along the border with Israel have morphed into confrontations between soldiers and Hamas-led “nighttime confusion units,” backed by teams dispatching incendiary balloons. Three Palestinians were killed in confrontations last weekend in what Palestinians call the “Marches of Return,” which are approaching their one-year anniversary this weekend.
None of the militant groups in Gaza claimed responsibility for Monday morning’s rocket attack, saying it had been an accident -- the same explanation given for a March 14 attack near Tel Aviv that caused no injuries or damage. The attacks challenge Netanyahu’s reputation as the guardian of Israel’s security just as he faces a challenge at the polls from a center-left bloc led by former Army chief Benny Gantz.
“I have a simple message to Israel’s enemies: We will do whatever we must do to defend our people and defend our state,” Netanyahu said at a news conference with Trump at the White House, saying he would “lead the people of Israel and the soldiers of Israel.”
Israel’s army said its targets included a secret Hamas intelligence headquarters that was one of the group’s “central assets,” as well as the office of Hamas Chairman Ismail Haniyeh, who vowed that “our people won’t surrender.” Gaza health officials reported seven people were injured in the wave of attacks.
The rocket fire interrupted a U.S. trip Netanyahu hoped would bolster an election campaign tarnished by his recent entanglement in a naval acquisition bribery scandal. The prime minister, who is likely to be indicted in three other corruption cases, has not been a suspect in the case, but Israeli media say prosecutors are weighing investigating him after learning Netanyahu once held shares in a company that supplied German shipbuilder Thyssenkrupp AG. Netanyahu says he sold the shares in 2010, long before the sub order, and is innocent of any wrongdoing.
Some polls have shown Netanyahu’s Likud party slipping since the reports emerged, but his current coalition of right-wing and religious parties still would have an advantage over Gantz’s bloc. Gantz, addressing AIPAC on Monday, staked out hardline security positions similar to Netanyahu’s, while calling for domestic unity.
“The reality in the south, as we unfortunately saw today, where Israeli children spend their nights in bomb shelters while the heads of Hamas celebrate, must end now,” Gantz said. He also swiped at Netanyahu, saying “divisive dialogue” is tearing Israel apart, and pledged that a government he leads would have no corruption.

A festival of concerts and fireworks for the kingdom’s national day has taken on greater importance.
Less than a week after an attack on its largest oil refinery exposed Saudi Arabia’s weakness, the country will erupt in celebration for a holiday to showcase its strength.
The kingdom’s 89th National Day, replete with five days of fireworks, has taken on new significance this year for Saudis. It already was supposed to be the biggest ever extravaganza after a year of international pressure on leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Then came last weekend’s drone strikes on one of the world’s biggest spenders on defense. 
For Saudis strolling along Riyadh’s Tahlia Street, the celebrations, planned months in advance, are an occasion to show defiance in the face of the most serious violation of Saudi sovereignty in decades.
“It’s important to celebrate our national day to reinforce our love for our country and to show the enemy we’re not scared and it won’t affect us,” said Amal al-Mutairi, a 24-year-old student who wore a pin with pictures of Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman, on her black abaya cloak.

Nearby, Saudis gathered to watch traditional dances performed to rhythmic music and children hoisted on their dad’s shoulders waved the kingdom’s flag. Patisseries sold cakes dyed in the flag’s green color and shops offered special discounts for the occasion.
Entertainment company Cirque du Soleil will perform in the Eastern Province at a location an hour’s drive from the site of the unprecedented Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabia’s energy industry. Concerts, street festivals and art and craft workshops will be held across the kingdom under the slogan “Himma Hatta al-Qimma,” which roughly means “Strength Until the End.”
The theme of the events for the Sept. 23 National Day was inspired by Prince Mohammed’s words last year in which he compared his people’s strength to the country’s Twaiq Mountain, said Amr Banaja, chief executive officer of the General Entertainment Authority, which is organizing the events.
“The aspirations of Saudis will never break just like this mountain won't,” Banaja said in an interview on Thursday before the festivities kicked off. “So nothing will stop us.”
Saudi Arabia has been stepping up a  public relations campaign both at home and abroad. Its reputation in the U.S. and other countries has been battered by the war in Yemen, the detention of female activists and the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October.
The U.S. Congress has condemned the Saudis over the Khashoggi murder and the Yemen military campaign.
Saudi and U.S. officials have said the drones and missiles used in the refinery strike last week were made by Iran, had never before been deployed by Iranian proxy groups and came from a northerly direction, ruling out Yemen as a launch site.
But they stopped short of saying the strikes were  launched directly from or by the Islamic Republic, claims that could have propelled a drift toward war. The attacks caused an unprecedented surge in oil prices.
“The impact of the attack against the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure will be felt long after the physical damage has been repaired and key infrastructure reconstructed,” Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at political risk company Verisk Maplecroft, said in a report. “Most importantly, the attacks have highlighted a vulnerability that cannot be easily or quickly remedied.”

In a sea of electric concepts and far-off prototypes, a shift in tone may indicate the supers have jumped the shark. 
Pininfarina promises its Battista supercar will come with 1,900 horsepower, zero emissions, and an all-electric range of 280 miles. 
At the Frankfurt Auto Show this month, Lamborghini will unveil a V12 hybrid supercar called the Siån.
The Bologna, Italy-based brand will make 63 of them, all already spoken for.
Lamborghini had hinted at its importance publicly in recent months and described in past detail how such special projects form an integral part of the business. Though unconfirmed, early reports set the price of the car around $3 million—an astronomical though increasingly common amount.  
“The  Reventon prompted the big discussion about the dimensions of this segment,” Maurizio Reggiani, Lamborgini’s chief engineer, told Bloomberg Pursuits during an interview in his office at company headquarters, noting that Lamborghini “started” the segment with its Lamborghini Reventon in 2007. “We were the first to do it like this. As we scouted more and more during that time, we started to see how, in this market, you can stretch in terms of price and in terms of demand. The Reventon coupe was $3 million; the [Reventon] roadster was $3.2 million; the Centenario was $2 million. So in this segment, we know there is a marvelous market.”
The mid-engine V12, all-wheel-drive Reventon famously hit 220mph on a test in Dubai, an astounding figure for a production car at that time. Only 20 were made, plus one marked for the Lamborghini museum. 
Should it happen, the new hybrid will join a burgeoning field of extremely limited-edition hybrid and electric supercars from such luxury powerhouses as Aston Martin, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Lotus, Mercedes-Benz, and Pininfarina. They have been flaunted recently in dazzling hues on golf courses and during private parties at seaside villas, heralded on Instagram fanboy accounts and Rodeo Drive parades orchestrated for YouTube.
Where it used to be that a company would have only one ever, or at most, one per year, now it seems they’re whipping them up as fast as possible. In the past year, Aston Martin alone has debuted and promised supercars in spades: the super-lightweight 1,160-horsepower Valkyrie and the 986 hp Valhalla hybrids, plus a Vanquish Vision concept and Valkyrie AMR Pro concept, not to mention the electric offerings from its Lagonda department. They follow the precedent from the One-77 and Vulcan supercars that came in the years before. It’s quite a different mood for what used to be a staid, small automaker tucked into the verdant hills of England’s Cotswolds region.
Many supercars, such as the $2.72 million Mercedes-AMG Project One limited-to-275 hybrid supercar based on Mercedes’s Formula 1 car, are sold as concepts, or very rough prototypes, and require six- or seven-figure deposits years in advance to ensure delivery. Others are sold with even less—a few sketches, a rendering, a foam-filled shell at an auto show. That’s if you can even get on the list to buy one. The official party line for most, like the Lambo, is that they have sold out before they’re even seen.
Some collectors are starting to find the rigmarole rather tedious.
“We need an awakening and cleansing soon to get everyone back into reality,” says Dan Kang, the well-known car collector based in Southern California, who owns a McLaren Senna, a Guntherwerks Porsche 911, and Lamborghini Centenario in similar carbon fiber livery, among other supercars. “It’s not even the new companies, but the current heritage brands as well, who feel they can demand the new price points without much substance. They need to support what they have already sold—not what [car] they can shovel up next.”
When manufacturers are unveiling cars that can’t be driven for years to come, and the very people able to afford them are over the hype anyway, it raises the question: Have we reached peak supercar?
Modern supercars, and their higher-end cousins, hypercars—both relative terms defined largely by whom you ask—are latecomers to the thread of automotive history. First, there were the rockets of their time, such as the Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows of the 1930s and 300SL Gullwings of the 1950s. In the 1960s, the Ferrari 250 GTOs dominated countless races and reached automotive immortality as the ultimate auction house blue-chip buys. But the supercar as we know it really came into its own in the late 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s, when hedonism reigned supreme. Such early examples as the Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari F40 set major precedents for design and performance. They were like space ships, compared the mundane and affordable metal boxes of the day. Everyone has a favorite; just ask the guys down at the weekend coffee klatch about the Vector, the Ferrari Enzo, or the Porsche Carrera GT. You’ll get a reaction.
They were duly expensive. A Countach sold for $72,000 at the time, or the equivalent of $375,000 today; the F40 cost $400,000, or the equivalent of $884,000 today.
Supercars tend to age well if you have the patience, luck, and financing to get your hands on one: On Aug. 16 in Monterey, Calif., a 1994 McLaren F1 sold for $19.8 million, obliterating the previous high-price paid for a McLaren: $13.75 million in 2015. (Its original MSRP was  around $1 million.) You won’t be surprised to learn that the man who designed that car, Gordon Murray, is now designing a round of 100 new supercars tentatively called the T50 and priced near $3 million.
The role of the supercar used to be to act as the halo for the brand, to attract media attention and consumer hype to a marque. Even if only a few people could afford to actually buy the exciting, sexy car, they’d know about the brand because of it and then buy something more affordable. Automakers figured that if you loved, or at least knew about, the  Acura NSX that Formula 1 champion Aryton Senna helped develop, you’d be more likely to buy an Accord. It seems a stretch—but the basic awareness of a brand is half the battle, marketers say. And an NSX is a lot more likely to grab headlines than an Accord is.
Supercars also carried the advanced driving technologies consumers could expect to see seep into the rest of the product lineup in succeeding years. The SF90 Stradale that Ferrari debuted in May is the first plug-in hybrid in Ferrari’s history, with a 679-horsepower twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 paired to the brand’s first-ever hybrid motor. Its gasoline engine and trio of electric motors combined make it the most powerful Ferrari ever, totaling 968 horsepower.
In fact, the SF90 is the latest in an onslaught of supercars that has taken a slightly different tone.
Supercars are increasingly electric, rather than powered by the galloping V12 and W16 engines of old. The Aston Martin Valkyrie,  Koenigsegg Jesko,  Lotus Evija, Mercedes-Benz Project One, and  Pininfarina Battista, among others, all use electric motors to help boost them to ever-higher (at least in theory) feats of speed and strength. They all have yet to hit the market in production form.
They’re coming from all sides of the market, too: such big, old heritage brands as Lamborghini and Ferrari, of course, but also from namesake novelty brands such as Gordon Murray Automotive and just-minted startups dotting the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Korea, Japan and China. These boutiques tend to have obscure names and opaque origins, blending the lines among automotive companies, tech companies, and software startups. Witness the British Dendrobium D1 and Ariel P40, the Chinese XING Mobility Miss E, the Croatian Rimac Concept_One, and the Japanese Aspark Owl. They come and go in the automotive consciousness, many making a splash at a car show with a foam mold or rendering, trotting that same car around for a year or two, then quietly merging with a larger auto or tech company, or shutting down altogether.
Rather than loss-leaders for the brand, they’re now a big part of the business model—or the business model.
“Basically, [the deposits to the supercar startups are] seed money to get operations up and running—applied to the cost of the car,” says Kevin Tynan, senior automotive analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of it as venture capital, with the return being a supercar instead of a percentage.”
In November, Lamborghini announced the one-off Lamborghini SC18 Alston, created for a single customer at a multimillion-dollar cost. 
It was a strategy that took cues from the Lamborghini Reventon: When it debuted, its almost immediate sell-out success of all 20 models to Middle Eastern sheiks and Russian billionaires proved to Lamborghini brass that the market could handle the extravagant price and exclusivity of vehicles heretofore considered too wild for it to bear. This paved the way for the $4.5 million Veneno and the aforementioned, 759-horsepower Centenario, rare-as-plutonium supercars that came several years later.
Reggiani characterized the one-offs as a not-insignificant part of Lamborghini’s bottom line, though he declined to give a percentage.
Elsewhere, Ferrari, which announced a Special Projects Division 10 years ago, has built one-off cars such as the Superamerica 45 and the P540 Superfast Aperta. Aston Martin has quietly made such one-offs as the CC100 and Valkyrie hybrid; McLaren made the 1,035-hp hybrid Speedtail.
“The sky is the limit,” Bugatti chief Stephan Winkelmann said this summer at the Villa d’Este Concours d’Elegance. The company had just unveiled the La Voiture Noir car purchased by Ferdinand Piëch, the notorious Volksagen boss who died Aug 25. The car cost nearly $19 million, after taxes and fees.
Proponents, and corporate press materials, rave about the shocking designs and extensive technologies of these extreme supercars, but their proliferation has simultaneously spurred the customary cadre of critics. Those skeptics—or, maybe, prophets—point to a whole lot of empty promises from the automakers and question their connection to reality, whether now or later.
There’s no question that in the future the world is going to have to change. Consumers will have to find sustainable transportation, says Jim Glickenhaus, who makes road-legal hypercars and supercars of his own. But he notes that his wife’s Tesla S is already much faster than she could ever drive it on public roads, both legally and logistically.
“Where are you going to drive a 2,000-horsepower electric supercar? You’ll run out of road,” he says. “I already get a headache in the Tesla! And now we’re getting 2,000-horsepower hyper-electric cars? Seriously. Why you would ever need a 2000-horsepower electric hypercar? I just don’t understand. You’re never going to drive a hypercar to pick up groceries.”
Not that any of the people who currently own the few electric hypercars that have actually come to market ever go grocery shopping; the idea is that there is a finite and very small market for that type of car at all, and we are near reaching the saturation point. Call it hypercar fatigue, contagious only among those who have been buying the hypercars in the first place.
Many of the new supercars are not legal to bring into the United States under normal permitting, anyway. They’re legal only to “show and display,” not to drive on public roads, because they don’t meet federal safety and emissions regulations. The Ferrari Icona Series Monza SP1 and SP2 cars, for instance, are legal for track use only.
Not that it matters. Follow Kang on Instagram or Mattress King collector Michael Fux for any length of time, and you’ll see they drive their more-practical Porsches and Rolls-Royces more than the hypercars they hoard. (Fux recently pulled up to Manhattan's Cipriani restaurant in his white Rolls, for instance, rather than his green Senna.) Peruse the auction catalogues of any major sale, browse through the feed of wealthy Youtube go-getters, or ask the young scions of Saudi families: They’re all bragging about how few miles their supercar has on the odometer, not about the great drive they took up the coast, say. 
The popular thing for younger, newer collectors seems to be not driving your car, instead of driving it—a drastic change from the longstanding tradition of the best, most hallowed cars earning their stripes by taking epic drives, winning adventure races, and parading through Paris.
“This whole modern supercar-hypercar market is destined to collapse under its own weight and implode on itself,” says Winston Goodfellow, an automotive author and analyst who judged the  Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance last month. “After all, if the things aren’t being utilized for their original purpose, there are only so many suckers and cult members out there who will agree that this weird Kool Aid actually tastes good and makes sense to drink.”
There are other cracks in the proverbial armor. Mercedes-AMG has yet to deliver any of the Project One cars it promised nearly three years ago. (Deliveries are set for 2021, according to a Mercedes spokesman.) So does Ariel, with the P40 it announced in 2017; Aspark, with the undelivered Owls it announced in 2018; and XING, with the Miss R it announced in 2017. Dendrobium, which announced the D1 last year and has said it would be ready by 2022, is already pointing to Brexit as a reason why it may not be able to deliver on its promises.
“So many investors have said to us that they’re keen but need some resolution one way or another,” Dendrobium boss Nigel Gordon-Stewart told Top Gear. 
Indeed. Read through the fine lines of press releases about the new supercars and you’ll see phrases like “working toward being fully funded” and “working to develop a technology partner,” verbal cues that the company is far from anywhere near being able to make production cars. Faraday Future unveiled an electric hypercar concept called the FFZERO1 in 2016 without even having a factory—or the money to build one. It has yet to produce any cars.
Then there’s the fact that the values of the first supercars are slumping. The McLaren F1 that sold in Monterey set a record—but failed to match even the low end of its estimated value before the sale. At the Gooding & Co. auctions in Arizona earlier this year, a 1990 Countach failed to reach even its low value estimate of $275,000; so did a Ferrari Testarossa listed for $250,000-$300,000 that sold for (just) $221,200. 
The automakers themselves remain notoriously cagey about exactly how supercar sales have been faring. Many blast instant- or near-immediate sell-out numbers in press releases, while other—when asked privately and perhaps more transparently—say that roughly half sold very early, and the rest are expected to sell in the coming weeks. Bugatti, one of the more forthcoming of the lot, has said that this applies to its Centodieci. It famously had to sell only one of the La Voiture Noire cars, anyway the one that went to Piech.  
It’s telling, if anecdotal, that public sentiment may be shifting. Locals near one of the biggest annual supercar gatherings in the world—on Cannery Row in Monterey during car week—even succeeded in getting it canceled this year amid complaints of noise and general disruption. Please don’t “hoon” around in your Lamborghini, one Instagram user requested.  
It was a blow to the automotive “influencers” who are the prime targets for the hypercars—to their egos, at least. After all, if you can’t show off your supercar on social media, is it even really yours, bro?
“The pendulum has already started to swing. It’s just that people don’t notice it because all these manufacturers are flooding the market with new product and obfuscating the view,” says Goodfellow. “When you have companies selling things that can’t even be driven on the street—and no one thinks this is weird—there is real distortion.”

Major chain stores including Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s have all recently reported healthy sales numbers, showing that Americans are confident enough to tune out trade wars, literal wars, global economic fragility, angry presidential tweets, the disappointing end to “Games of Thrones” and other problems. 
Sarah Halzack writes that Target Corp. is capitalizing on people’s propensity to spend by introducing appealing in-house brands of apparel and food, and by stressing store pickups of merchandise ordered online. As long as retailers deliver what shoppers want, Sarah says, nothing seems to stop Americans’ red, white and blue shopping carts full of stuff — at least for now. 
Conor Sen also finds proof of the strong U.S. consumer economy in the form of a chicken sandwich that has set off a social media frenzy. 
Good economic times tend to be when fast-food restaurants come out with an iconic menu item— in a stealth effort to raise prices and offset rising costs. The Big Mac and the Whopper debuted during times of low unemployment. Now, Conor says, the Popeyes $3.99 chicken sandwich and plant-based burgers on offer at other fast-food chains are signs that restaurants believe people are feeling good enough to embrace better menu items at premium prices. Economic health can’t last forever, but fried chicken on a brioche bun may endure. 
You know what isn’t great for a retailer? Walmart Inc. this week sued Tesla Inc. over claims that the electric car maker’s solar panel business — created after its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity — botched installations at Walmart stores and sparked several electrical fires on store roofs. (Tesla’s lawyer blamed Walmart for “breaches of contract” and “bad faith.”) The Walmart litigation, Liam Denning says, “adds to the sense that SolarCity was a deal that Tesla didn’t need and which has  ultimately burdened its resources and now maybe its reputation, too.”
Poverty or economic inequality are widely seen as the reasons for resentments flaring up in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir, and in Hong Kong. But economic grievances are not the primary force behind discontent in either place, Mihir Sharma writes. The deeper issue is identity, and protesters are worried about distant central governments paring back what little autonomy citizens have. These trends are evident from Britain to Ohio and beyond, Mihir writes. 
How would you like to loan someone $100 for 30 years, and after those decades you get less than $100 back? It sounds about as appealing as a root canal. But investors are so anxious about economic conditions, they’re willing to park money in safe government bonds, even if it means earning no interest. 
Fear, however, does have its limits. Germany didn’t have as many takers as it expected for a sale of government bonds that offered zero interest payments. Marcus Ashworth says these German bonds were a step too far, but this is hardly the end of negative-yielding debt. “This is the new normal,” Marcus declares, especially with the European Central Bank poised to buy debt in a bid to stem economic weakness.

Nothing can stop Americans from buying cartloads of stuff, or splurging on fast food. 
Americans are buying stuff! 
The world is a chaotic mess, but apparently there are no problems that shopping and fast food can’t solve. 
Major chain stores including Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s have all recently reported healthy sales numbers, showing that Americans are confident enough to tune out trade wars, literal wars, global economic fragility, angry presidential tweets, the disappointing end to “Game of Thrones” and other problems. 
Sarah Halzack writes that Target Corp. is capitalizing on people’s propensity to spend by introducing appealing in-house brands of apparel and food, and by stressing store pickups of merchandise ordered online. As long as retailers deliver what shoppers want, Sarah says, nothing seems to stop Americans’ red, white and blue shopping carts full of stuff — at least for now. 
Conor Sen also finds proof of the strong U.S. consumer economy in the form of a chicken sandwich that has set off a social media frenzy. 
Good economic times tend to be when fast-food restaurants come out with an iconic menu item— in a stealth effort to raise prices and offset rising costs. The Big Mac and the Whopper debuted during times of low unemployment. Now, Conor says, the Popeyes $3.99 chicken sandwich and plant-based burgers on offer at other fast-food chains are signs that restaurants believe people are feeling good enough to embrace better menu items at premium prices. Economic health can’t last forever, but fried chicken on a brioche bun may endure. 
You know what isn’t great for a retailer? Walmart Inc. this week sued Tesla Inc. over claims that the electric car maker’s solar panel business — created after its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity — botched installations at Walmart stores and sparked several electrical fires on store roofs. (Tesla’s lawyer blamed Walmart for “breaches of contract” and “bad faith.”) The Walmart litigation, Liam Denning says, “adds to the sense that SolarCity was a deal that Tesla didn’t need and which has  ultimately burdened its resources and now maybe its reputation, too.”
Poverty or economic inequality are widely seen as the reasons for resentments flaring up in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir, and in Hong Kong. But economic grievances are not the primary force behind discontent in either place, Mihir Sharma writes. The deeper issue is identity, and protesters are worried about distant central governments paring back what little autonomy citizens have. These trends are evident from Britain to Ohio and beyond, Mihir writes. 
How would you like to loan someone $100 for 30 years, and after those decades you get less than $100 back? It sounds about as appealing as a root canal. But investors are so anxious about economic conditions, they’re willing to park money in safe government bonds, even if it means earning no interest. 
Fear, however, does have its limits. Germany didn’t have as many takers as it expected for a sale of government bonds that offered zero interest payments. Marcus Ashworth says these German bonds were a step too far, but this is hardly the end of negative-yielding debt. “This is the new normal,” Marcus declares, especially with the European Central Bank poised to buy debt in a bid to stem economic weakness.

After two mass shootings within 24 hours earlier this month, President Trump backed “very meaningful” background checks for firearm purchases. Predictably, he then retreated, despite wide popular support for comprehensive background checks. 
Bloomberg’s editorial board throws cold water on Trump’s claims that the U.S. already has strong background checks, and says he is misguided in blaming mass gun deaths on a “mental health problem.” The editorial board says the president’s initial words show that even with Trump’s strong ties to the gun lobby, he  feels the political pressure to do the right thing. More pressure might actually bring long overdue change, the editorial board writes. 
It also took Trump less than 24 hours to backtrack on a couple of tax-cut ideas. On Tuesday, he suggested his administration was considering paring a payroll tax paid by American workers and their employers to fund Social Security and Medicare. On Wednesday, Trump said he is “not looking at a tax cut now.” 
Before this presidential flip-flop, Tyler Cowen wrote that economic theory suggests wages would adjust to a relatively small reduction in payroll taxes, and therefore employees wouldn’t see raises on a tax-adjusted basis. Politically, a temporary payroll tax could benefit  both the president and his opponents, Karl W. Smith said, by taking the issue off the table until after the 2022 midterm elections.

It was always going to be a tough sell. The world's first 30-year bond offering a zero coupon got a lukewarm response from investors today, falling well below Germany's target sales of €2 billion. Weak orders suggests negative yields across Europe may finally be taking their toll on investor demand. Here's a look at what was expected.
Boris Johnson wants to rally support for former Finance Minister George Osborne to become the next head of the IMF, a person familiar said. Johnson will use the G-7 meetings in Biarritz, France, this weekend to urge President Trump and other world leaders to support a U.K. bid for Osborne. A Briton has never run the IMF, and the new government may see it as a way to maintain its standing on the world stage after Brexit.
Italy's opposition is striving to avert an election and stop the League party from governing alone. A coalition between the Five Star Movement and the Democrats is emerging as an option after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte quit yesterday. President Mattarella has the sole power to appoint governments and call elections. ""It is now our turn to move and show the way ahead,"" Democrats leader Nicola Zingaretti said.
Ryanair's bid to block a strike by Irish pilots was upheld by a court in Dublin, while a hearing in London will determine whether U.K. crews can walk out ahead of the bank holiday—the busiest weekend for air travel. Members of the British Airline Pilots' Association and Ireland's Forsa are seeking a raise and the U.K. union had accused Ryanair of resorting to ""bullying tactics"" by taking the dispute to court.

A breakdown in communication may be cited as a reason for a lack of understanding among regulators about key design elements on the Boeing 737 Max until the first of the two crashes, a person familiar said. The safety feature that forced down the nose of the jets evolved during development and the changes weren't always flagged adequately.
Markets may be overreacting to other political events around the globe, but they're underreacting to those in Italy, John Authers writes for Bloomberg Opinion. In 2017, the prospect of Marine Le Pen—a very similar politician to Matteo Salvini—gaining the French presidency was enough to frighten investors to the core. Salvini's chances of taking power in Italy now look much higher than Le Pen's did then; the only alternative appears to be a dreadful mess.
It took the threat of a recession at home to get Germany to promise fiscal stimulus, but that isn't how the euro zone is meant to work, Ferdinando Giugliano writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Without a centralized pot of money, stronger countries like Germany should have acted much earlier to boost their own demand to help fellow members.
If Egypt is the Middle East's best-performing economy, why are more and more Egyptians becoming poorer, Amr Adly asks in Bloomberg Opinion. Instead of focusing primarily on GDP growth, international lenders should care more about where that growth occurs, and how it's redistributed through state expenditure and revenues so that more people reap the rewards.   
Zimbabwe's rulers are in a trap of their own making.

While electric cars are a realistic alternative to the century-old internal-combustion engine, the world's waterways are dominated by ships that belch plumes of diesel exhaust and heavy fuel oil.

Denmark's Queen Margrethe II has expressed her surprise at Donald Trump's decision to call off his state visit, following his unsuccessful attempt to acquire Greenland.

Scholz won the day after standing firm against demands from some in Merkel's Christian Democratic party to abolish the so-called solidarity surcharge completely.

The stock closed 31% higher at 8.48 Egyptian pounds, after shares were sold at 6.46 pounds in the IPO. The offering represented 36% of Fawry’s share capital and raised about 1.6 billion pounds ($97 million). EFG Hermes Holding managed the sale.
Fawry is an 11-year-old company that facilitates electronic bill-payments in urban neighborhoods, and counts 20 million Egyptians as customers, according to its website. Its retail network includes grocers and pharmacies. A tranche of the IPO offered to institutional investors was oversubscribed by 15.9 times, according to EFG Hermes.
Fawry is the first IPO on the EGX since Sarwa Capital in October 2018, as high interest rates attract investors to fixed income rather than equities. The government has delayed plans to offer stakes in some state-run companies, sales that were supposed to streamline the bloated public sector and turn around loss-making enterprises.
Following the “good reception” of the IPO, the stock will likely outperform within its first month of trading, said Amr Elalfy, the head of research at SHUAA Securities Egypt. More than 80% of subscribers were Egyptians, according to data from the bourse.
A stock stabilization fund managed by EFG Hermes will help sustain the stock price in the first month of trading. This measure “should support the stock holders from the public offering,” Elalfy said earlier this week. Potential risks to the stock’s performance include low liquidity, revenue and growth rates that fail to meet market expectations and weakening margins, he said.
The company has “exceptional growth potential,” said Allen Sandeep, director of research at Naeem Holding in Cairo. That contrasts with most companies in the same sector in emerging markets that are making losses, he said.

The 106-year-old automaker is working hard to beat a few imposing obstacles, from a limp IPO to historically low production volume.
Aston Martin officially debuted the electric Rapide E last month at the Shanghai Auto Show—nearly four years after its initial announcement about the car.
Based on the V12-powered Rapide, the sedan will arrive in one small batch, with a scant 155 “special edition” cars produced. But contrary to widespread speculation, it won’t star in the upcoming 25th installment of the James Bond franchise.
It would have been a somewhat unexpected product placement anyway, considering Bond’s image as a well-dressed rule-breaker, rather than a well-dressed environmentalist. And Great Britain’s 106-year-old company has plenty of bigger problems that even Bond himself wouldn’t be able to fix.
When Deutsche Bank revised its outlook for Aston Martin on April 8 to a more negative view, its shares plummeted, finally settling down by market’s close at half of October’s initial public offering price of  19 pounds ($24.70). That figure  gave the company a market capitalization of 4.1 billion pounds. Analysts cited “higher volatility in demand” and “limited share price potential” as factors leading to the downgrade. (The company had announced a $190 million note issue to generate more funds April 3.)
Last year’s IPO fell completely  flat, and uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the general cooling of the automotive market has done much to shake investor confidence in the iconic English marque. Aston Martin is currently worth less than one-fifth the value of its rival Ferrari, a company Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer had said his brand’s own value would exceed when it made its debut as a public company.  
“We’ve taken 105 years to get to an IPO. We’re not going to worry much on what the initial shares are doing,” Palmer said in an interview with Bloomberg TV after it went public. “We will always look over the longer term.”
One challenge Aston must face is its historically low production numbers. Last year the brand sold fewer than 6,500 vehicles worldwide, far less than even Porsche, let alone BMW or Mercedes-Benz. That exclusivity has always been part of the brand’s cachet, but to increasingly diminishing returns. In this day and age, when trucks and SUVs reign supreme, car companies must sell lots of vehicles to stay afloat. Even arch-rival Ferrari has announced plans to make an SUV. 
Meanwhile, Aston Martin has been forced to give deep dealer incentives to jump-start sales of its new Vantage, a $150,000 coupe. The success of that car is crucial to overall corporate health, since as the lower-priced, lower-powered Aston Martin, it was intended to be its biggest seller. And although Aston Martin will report its best Q1 ever for North America this year, the IPO resulted in a pretax loss of £68 million ($89 million) for 2018.
“They haven’t had the right product cadence yet,” says Kevin Tynan, the lead automotive analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “If anything they’ve been a little quiet while all of this news is happening around them. If you were a conspiracy theorist, you’d be worried about [where they are getting] funding.”  
Of course, Tynan notes, quiet doesn’t necessarily mean inactive. If you look carefully, Aston Martin is fighting its demons using the good old-fashioned multi-pronged approach.
Kris Singh is a young investor from Miami who spends millions of dollars at auto shows each year buying whatever he wants.
What he wants lately are hybrid supercars.
At the Geneva Motor Show in March, Singh reserved for himself the Aston Martin AM-RB 003, a $2 million hybrid that will start production in 2021. The hypercar was among the most-feted debuts at the year’s most exciting show, but it’s far from Aston Martin’s first million-dollar hybrid. The $3 million Valkyrie, which runs on a V12 engine paired with a lightweight electric motor, sold out almost instantly when it debuted in 2017, even though it will be later this year before its buyers can take it home.
Creating a halo around an electrified supercar is mandatory these days if you want to be like Ferrari. McLaren, Ferrari, Porsche, Pininfarina, and Mercedes-Benz all already make and sell—for very high margins—hybrid or all-electric supercars like the Pininfarina Battista and Ferrari LaFerrari.
Aston Martin declined to comment on the specific margins the company makes on such cars but a spokesperson did note that “specials” like the AM-RB 003 and the Aston Martin Valkyrie have a “significant impact” on the company’s average selling price. In 2018, the average selling price per vehicle at Aston Martin was £141,000 ($184,460) excluding special cars. It was £157,000 ($205,390) including them. 
Plus, with a decades-long Formula 1 and endurance racing heritage bolstering the credentials of some of the best-driving sports cars on the market, the car highlights one area where the brand can excel, Tynan says, even if it is in extremely low volumes. The company will make fewer than 500 of them for worldwide distribution. 
“Honestly my opinion is that Aston Martin is in a pretty good spot in terms of this whole hypercar and electrification thing,” he says. “People still want their hypercars. They want performance, and they’re willing to pay for it. Aston Martin won’t have to change who they are to fit into the evolution of what’s going on with the industry.”
With their instant torque and less-demanding range demands, it’s no accident that the Valkyrie and AM-RB 003 were Aston Martin’s first major electric-boosted endeavors to get legs. Their intergalactic body styles and high level of customization provide lightning-rod excitement for the brand, while the technology inside them will trickle down to more affordable wares, all of which will be available in hybrid or pure-electric form by 2025, Palmer said. 
Indeed, real-world electric driving performance is where Aston Martin can gain more market foothold. By the end of this year, global sales of electric vehicles will hit 2 million, up from 1.2 million in 2017, according to Frost & Sullivan’s Global Electric Vehicle Market Outlook 2018 report.
Though it’s trotting out the all-electric Rapide E at auto shows, the brand is far behind the rest of the pack. Tesla continues to steer the market segment for premium sedans and SUVs with its waiting-list-only Models S, 3 and X. Porsche will be selling the much-anticipated Taycan sedan by November. Audi and Jaguar are already selling excellent electric SUVs; BMW and Mercedes-Benz will be selling their own later this year.
What’s more, the race is intensifying. Porsche has said half of its vehicles will be electric by 2023, and BMW says it will do 25 electrified vehicles by 2025. To have a chance of keeping up, Aston Martin must show that it can make reliable daily drivers just as well as it makes track stars—those, ultimately, are where the bread-and-butter profits will derive. 
“There are plenty of customers who are high net worth and for whom sustainability is important,” says Ian Fletcher, the principal analyst at IHS Market, an automotive research firm. “Does Aston need to have something more than an electric Rapide E? Of course. But they’re moving forward with their [long-term] strategy, and at the end of the day, they just need to keep pedaling.”  
The brand is also aiming to launch a top-tier SUV to compete with the Porsche Cayenne and Macan, the Bentley Bentayga, and the Lamborghini Urus. It’s a tactic that’s worked for Bentley, which has doubled production numbers with its new Bentayga, and for Porsche, whose $50,000 Macan is the company’s best-selling vehicle. Scheduled for its official unveiling by the end of 2019, with sales in 2020, the DBX is intended to do the same kind of heavy lifting—Aston wants to double its total production by 2023, Palmer said, when the company will make 14,000 total vehicles worldwide.
“I think [DBX] bodes well for the brand,” says Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst for IHS Markit. “Aston Martin is a brand defined by being highly beautiful and highly powerful, but it’s a little less edgy than a Lamborghini, so it naturally fits in that space [of SUVs and crossovers] to begin with.” 
It’s a big step up. In 2018, Aston Martin sold 6,441 vehicles total, up 26 percent, year over year. It will likely sell 7,300 in 2019, a spokeswoman said. But the hope is that DBX will have a natural home in North America, with its insatiable lust for crossovers and SUVs. In 2016, SUV sales in the U.S. surpassed those of cars. By 2022, Americans will have  more new SUVs from which to choose than cars.
Elsewhere, Aston Martin’s Atlas of an SUV must also heave onto its shoulders the responsibility of raising market share in China again after a 31 percent jump in sales last year. It’s a can’t-miss opportunity to pounce where rivals like Jaguar Land Rover and Daimler have seen sales stumble.
And the brand must attract more women buyers, an audience Aston Martin has sought since 2015, with indeterminate results. In 2017, the company created a “female advisory panel” to review and provide feedback on current and future products. Last year it scrambled to name a woman to its formerly all-male board. Laura Schwab became president of the Aston Martin Americas division in 2015. Through a representative, both Palmer and Schwab declined to be interviewed for this story.
“Aston Martin is in a good position here,” Brinley says. “When you go into the utility vehicle space, that naturally opens you up to more women.”
The stopgap, until DBX, is Vantage. At least, it should have been. In March, Aston Martin North America sold 93 Vantages out of its 182 total cars sold, its second-best month since the car was introduced. But the company’s ongoing and hefty financing payouts for the sinuous coupe have suggested Aston Martin buyers aren’t as excited as they might be. Steve Serio, the Aston Martin dealer in Boston, said he’s had multiple Vantages languish for months on his showroom floor before they sell.
“My buyers are 98 percent male and between the ages of 40 and 65,” Serio said. They buy rather than lease their cars as well—the exact types of drivers who prefer manual to paddle-shifting by a wide margin. The Vantage, however, is not currently available in North America with a stick-shift gearbox. A Vantage AMR version with manual transmission is due to arrive later this year, while the standard model Vantage will offer it starting in 2020. 
“It’s really the Vantage that’s the concern,” agreed Michael Dean, the senior analyst of European automotive for Bloomberg Intelligence. He noted the higher MSRPs for the new-generation model, which have created a subtle cooling effect on sales. He noted the polarizing new grille, which gapes at the front of the car like a catfish. And he noted that competitor Porsche’s excellent new 911 has received rave reviews.
“While the Vantage isn’t a key driver of earnings, it will impact sentiment toward the shares in the first half of the year,” Dean said.
Fortunately for Aston Martin, success in the automotive world is solidified over more time than the first half of this year. “It could be decades before things play out,” Tynan says.
Analyst Dean says Aston Martin has enough access to cash in 2019. Fletcher says it has well accounted for contingencies like Brexit and is optimistic in spite of a subtle downturn in global auto markets. “Aston Martin is one of the most bullish despite everything,” he notes. 
The analysts agree that if the company can stay conservative with cash expenditures while managing to produce high-performance products with such regularity that it becomes routine, it has a real chance of beating its current challenges.  
Unsurprisingly, Palmer himself has recommended taking a long view when evaluating the company’s fortunes.
“We said at the time of the IPO not to buy us if you are not going long term,” Palmer told Bloomberg in February. “It’s all about growth through 2023.”

Emaar Properties PJSC, the developer of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, and Aldar Properties PJSC in Abu Dhabi, have gained this year as better-than-expected results and appealing dividends attracted investors. Damac Properties PJSC, on the other hand, has extended its declines with more outflows on the radar.
U.A.E. real estate stocks have been battered in the past two years amid increasing supply and faltering demand as lower oil prices hurt economies across the Gulf. Dubai residential prices have dropped about 25 percent from a peak in 2014, according to Craig Plumb, head of Middle East research at broker Jones Lang LaSalle. He estimates a contraction in the single digits this year.
Emaar Properties and Aldar have entities tied to the local government as their main shareholders. Both have “succeeded in generating growth at the bottom of the cycle,” said Selima Mrabet, a financial analyst at Tunis-based equities research firm AlphaMena, warning that conditions are likely to remain difficult this year. “This move can only be sustained if it will be fueled by good news. The market needs to restore confidence in the real estate sector.”

Damac’s shares have declined 56 percent in the past 12 months and in February the company posted its lowest annual profit since going public in 2013. The stock could be excluded from MSCI Inc.’s main benchmarks in a review next month as it fails to meet technical requirements, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, an equities strategist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai. That could trigger further outflows, he said. It fell for a third session on Wednesday.
The company’s head of investor relations, Amr Aboushaban, said in an email that many of its future developments in Dubai have already been sold and that it’s “noting indications of market stabilization.”
Listen to a podcast on why Dubai’s real estate slump is no blip.
Damac is going through a “difficult journey” as its business model isn’t as flexible as its Dubai competitors because it only offers luxury developments, said Alphamena’s Mrabet. Oversupply and fierce competition will drop those who didn’t implement effective and efficient strategies “out of the race.”

On the plus side for him, according to his Attorney General William Barr, special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t accuse Trump or his campaign of conspiring with the Russian government to swing the 2016 election. The  question of collusion or no collusion – not an actual legal term, but still the benchmark by which Trump’s role in this has been judged, thanks mainly to Trump constantly yelling “NO COLLUSION!” – is now closed, writes Noah Feldman.
Mueller also punted to Barr the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, and Barr declined to run it back. But the AG dismissed obstruction too hastily,  writes Cass Sunstein, raising the odds that it will rear its head again. Mueller’s full report is still hidden, and until we see it all, we can’t know if Barr’s call was legitimate, Bloomberg’s editorial board writes.
What we already know from the probe is mortifying enough, notes Tim O’Brien, including the fact that Trump employed  many, many convicted criminals in his campaign and transition. Trump  claims the report marks a “Total EXONERATION!,” but his lawlessness in other areas is already out in the open, and he  still faces a raft of other investigations, Tim writes in a second column. Trump’s  impeachment risk is much lower in the AMR era, writes Jonathan Bernstein, but there are still grounds, and investigators are still looking for more.

British parliament is  due to vote tonight on whether to wrest the wheel of the Brexit clown car away from Theresa May. It probably won’t, but the prime minister still lacks the votes for her Brexit deal, which parliament has already rejected twice. With a new, slightly extended Brexit deadline still coming soon and no plan in sight, the actually  good idea of simply canceling Brexit is gaining political steam, even among some Brexit supporters, writes Therese Raphael. Alas, the politics are still too dicey to make this a real possibility, Therese adds. 
Further Brexit Reading:
Markets are still  grappling with the implications of the yield curve inverting – short-term rates going higher than long-term rates, a predictor of the past several recessions. Mohamed El-Erian writes there are many reasons to think, gulp,  it’s different this time – although he adds fears about the yield curve could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. And the yield curve isn’t the only recession signal flashing: Mark Whitehouse notes  economists’ forecasts have started to diverge noticeably, which has happened in each of the past three recessions.

As Tara Lachapelle  wrote recently, Warren Buffett has been sitting on an unusually large mountain of cash for an unusually long time. He is overdue, Tara writes in a new column, for what may be  one last “elephant-sized” deal. The big question is what might be a suitable target. With her understanding of the kinds of companies Buffett has acquired in the past, Tara has come up with a list of 20 possible purchases, including a certain American airplane-maker in hot water lately. See  the list here.
OPEC+ wants to delay a decision on ending its production cuts until June, but that  won’t give it any more clarity about the outlook for oil demand, writes Julian Lee.
On the surface, Tesla Inc. has done a lot right lately, but  investors see mainly desperation driving it, writes Liam Denning.

Muffman. But the story also resonates because it confirms our prior beliefs about the sorry state of the world. 
The rich always use money and connections to help their offspring, and this is more of the same, if only more hilarious and criminal than usual. The dark side of it is that the conditions motivating such behavior are getting worse: Widening inequality is making social networks (the old-fashioned kind; though being an Instagram influencer apparently doesn’t hurt) increasingly vital, writes Leonid Bershidsky, in a way that  reminds him uncomfortably of the status quo in Russia and former Soviet republics. If we could make college more about quality education and didn’t give outsize rewards to those who game the system, then incentives to cheat would fade. (It would also help, as Tyler Cowen wrote yesterday, if colleges weren’t so  afraid to flunk unqualified kids.) 
While we’re at it, we should also  stop giving college athletic coaches the god-like power to admit athletic recruits, writes Noah Feldman. This was a systemic flaw the alleged perps exploited after they learned merely buying a building wasn’t enough to get their kids into Yale. A coach, on the other hand, can admit anybody who can fog a mirror or photoshop themselves into a pole-vault.
And what’s truly nuts about all of this is that it   doesn’t matter where you go to school. Joe Nocera runs through a long list of the many wealthy, successful business leaders, including Tim Cook and Warren Buffett, who did not get degrees from fancy colleges. Going to Harvard may help you get that first job, but it won’t help you become, for example, the CEO. 
After watching the rest of the world go first, the FAA finally  grounded Boeing Co.,’s 737 Max 8 airplane, which has been involved in two fatal crashes in the past five months. This was obviously the proper call, but it only came after several days of Boeing and the FAA repeatedly declaring the plane was perfectly fine to keep flying, Brooke Sutherland notes. Now Boeing still must take the bottom-line hit of grounding the plane and addressing its issues, but blew its chance at getting reputational credit  for doing the right thing right away, Brooke writes.
A day after routing Theresa May’s Brexit deal, parliament voted against leaving the EU with no deal at all. So that disastrous outcome will be avoided, at least – but only temporarily. Currency traders have been vigorously buying the British pound, apparently believing many bad outcomes will be avoided, notes Lionel Laurent. That’s dangerous, because  most options available to the U.K. still look very bad; and even the worst outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit, are still on the table, Lionel writes. 
Further Brexit Reading: 
One of the worst features of America’s health-care system is the stroke-inducing medical bill you often get after a hospital stay. This happens so often there’s a name for it: “balance billing.” This is when every provider you see in a medical emergency is, darn the luck, out of your insurance network, and you personally get billed the GDP of a small nation for it. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are working on a fix, Bloomberg’s editorial board writes, and  Congress needs to approve it quickly.
The Trump administration and Congress, meanwhile, keep poking at the problem of exorbitant drug prices, in ways that occasionally threaten the profits of drug makers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. This could inspire these companies to take matters into their own hands. Insurance giant UnitedHealth Group Inc., for example, just announced a drug-rebate plan that favors patients –and could also help fend off more regulation, writes Max Nisen.
Big Tech’s power has led to a revival of interest in antitrust law, with Elizabeth Warren and others calling to split up giants such as Facebook Inc. and Google. But a new U.K. study proposes regulators could instead try to zero in on problematic Big Tech practices, halting them immediately when necessary. This make more sense, and is a bigger threat to the giants, than the blunt approach of breakups, writes Alex Webb. 
Noah Smith, meanwhile, suggests the challenges of the future, from climate change to China’s geopolitical ambitions, could mean the government would be  better off harnessing Big Tech rather than destroying it.

Most of them are electric. 
Most of them are electric.

When it comes to the most expensive luxury cars, auto shows are increasingly irrelevant.
For years, the most prestigious automakers in the world have saved their best debuts—and the bulk of their event marketing budgets—for such glamorous locales as the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, the Goodwood Festival of Speed, and the Villa d’Este at Lake Como. Auto shows may draw a lot of people, but with their fluorescent lighting and retro carpeting, they’re hardly a seductive showcase for wealthy private buyers.
The exception is the  Geneva Motor Show. 
With press days starting next week and a public opening to run from March 7 to 17, the annual event near Lake Leman will be the first gilded showcase of the year for the likes of  Bugatti,  Koenigsegg,  Lamborghini, and  Pininfarina, among others.
“Auto shows for automakers to send messages to each other—or basically, just show off—are going away. That has gotten really expensive,” says Matt DeLorenzo, the senior managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. “The only show that has that still really going on is Geneva. This is where the Italian design houses and the Bentleys and Bugattis of the world can really show off, and they do.”
Credit the attitude partly to the fact that no major automaker makes its headquarters in Switzerland, so the country is in spiritually neutral territory, unlike New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Frankfurt, or Tokyo.
“In Geneva, they actually sell cars to really rich people,” DeLorenzo adds, noting that the region holds some of the world’s wealthiest people, who are happy to deign to visit the Palexpo center, where the show is held. At least it’s near the likes of the Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, and Jaeger-LeCoultre watch houses. “Aston Martin may skip a show in the U.S., but they’ll be at the Geneva show with a full product line, selling cars from the stand. It’s a totally different dynamic than any other car show on the face of the Earth.”
Where the fashion world flocks to Paris for its seasonal runway spectacles, tout le monde from the elite automotive world convenes in Geneva.
This year in Geneva has turned the hypercar knob three clicks to the right. Koenigsegg will bring a much-anticipated successor to the  world record-setting Agera RS; Pininfarina will show the its first-ever production car, an expected all-electric, 1,900hp, elegant beast; and Bugatti may bring an $18 million modern take on the iconic Atlantic from 1936. That’s just the start.
Each of the supercar brands in attendance is cashing in on the global appetite for extremely expensive, extremely limited editions of cars from heritage brands. It’s a market that seems to be stable, if only in small quantities. When your cars cost  $2 million each, you don’t have to sell many to survive.
“These types of cars are being built in the 10s,” DeLorenzo said. “There are certainly enough people who want to have one of 10 of something. Or even one of 100.”
French brand Bugatti will show an “110 ans Bugatti” tribute Bugatti Chiron Sport to celebrate the anniversary of the brand’s founding in 1909. That is the latest of the Chiron series and follows the  $5.8 million Divo that Bugatti brought to Pebble Beach last August. More spectacular though, and currently secret, will be a second Bugatti car with a rumored $18 million price tag. It may be a modern take on the iconic Bugatti 57 SC Atlantic that Bugatti has announced it will also bring to Geneva; the new one-off version is rumored to have been commissioned by former Volkswagen Group chief Ferdinand Pieech.  
Sweden’s Koenigsegg will bring the much-anticipated successor to the Agera RS, code-named Ragnarok, which is a term from Norse mythology that connotes the apocalypse. Company executives have said that the model they will show in Geneva may not carry that name, but they expect it boast an update to the twin-turbo, 5.0-liter V8 engine in the Agera RS, with horsepower above 1,360. And a whale of a tail. 
Italy’s dual pride and joys—Ferrari and Lamborghini—will each bring supercars to Geneva, though they’ll likely be divided in purpose. Ferrari has announced it will bring the  F8 Tributo, the evolution of the 488, a turbocharged V8 with 710 horsepower and a six-figure price tag. (To the untrained eye, it looks just like the 488.) 
Lamborghini will bring the edgy Huracán Evo Spyder, a tuned-up open-top version of its segment-leading  Huracán. The Evo, a higher-powered, 5.2-liter, V10 engine that produces 640 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque. It’s so fast it will get to 62 miles per hour in just 3.1 seconds, with a top speed of 202 mph. That’s slower than the new  McLaren 600LT Spider and  McLaren 720S Spider, though perhaps more visceral—and louder—to drive.
In the meantime, Alfa Romeo will bring Giulia Quadrifoglio and Stelvio Quadrifoglio “Alfa Romeo Racing” limited editions made to honor the brand’s return to Formula 1. Showgoers will also see the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti, or “Turismo Internazionale,” and the new Alfa Romeo Giulietta. 
The British will invade Geneva, too: Aston Martin is going to debut the Project 003, the third high-performance, mid-engine car the company has built in recent years, following the $2.6 million Aston Martin Valkyrie and Valkyrie AMR Pro. (Those cars were called “001” and “002,” respectively). It’s expected that Project 003 is some sort of street version of the Valkyrie and  will go on sale by 2021. 
There are plenty of other lesser-known—but, in some cases, no less outré—new cars to see this year in Geneva. Many come from small, heritage-house automotive jewels, obscure startups, or once-dormant brands from around the globe.
Count  Pininfarina’s Battista foremost among the lot. The 89-year-old Italian design house famed for outfitting yachts and Ferraris has said it will make just 150 of the electric marvel to sell at a price of more than $2 million.
The 1,900-horsepower electric supercar is said to have a top speed of 250mph and a driving range of 300 miles under all-electric power. It looks stunning: slender LED headlights grab attention in the absence of a conventional front grill, and a wide light spans from one headlight to the other, acting as a daytime running light system. Its sleek body recalls the PFO that Pininfarina showed reporters at Pebble Beach last August. 
Hispano Suiza, the Spanish car company originally founded in 1904, will bring an electric car, too: the Carmen. It’s an all-electric grand tourer based on the unforgettable, art deco-style, 1938 Hispano-Suiza H6B Dubonnet Xenia. The historic company hopes to use the Barcelona-made car to relaunch itself back into the car-making business—and it’s accepting pre-orders now.
And Ginetta, a 61-year-old small British racing company based in Leeds, England, will show a half-million-dollar V8 supercar it has teased online. Ginetta says its 600-plus-horsepower car will have a top speed of 200mph, though it has yet to announce the name publicly.
It better be something good. We’ve already got everything from a 003 to a Ragnarok. This year in Geneva, it’s going to be hard to stand out.

“Four years isn’t enough,” Mahmoud Badr, one of the proposal’s sponsors, told talk show host Amr Adib late Saturday. About 125 of Egypt’s 596 legislators had signed the petition, and they’re still debating whether the change would affect El-Sisi’s second term alone or apply retroactively to his first term, Badr said.
Parliament Speaker Ali Abdel-Aal said Sunday he had referred the petition to committee. The term extension would have to be approved by parliament and in a national referendum because it would require a constitutional amendment. El-Sisi’s current term is to expire in 2022.
Momentum has been building for some time to either remove the current two-term limit or extend the length of the terms. A separate petition is currently before a Cairo urgent matters court.
Even before El-Sisi was re-elected to his second term last year, several lawmakers suggested amending the charter. The move was quickly shelved, however, amid concerns it would look like an El-Sisi power grab.
The former general-turned-president has repeatedly said he serves at the pleasure of Egyptians and has no ambition to become another “pharaoh,” as his predecessor, longtime autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak, was dubbed.
But even before winning his first election in 2014, El-Sisi launched a sweeping crackdown on Islamists that has also expanded to include activists and other potential opponents. In the 2018 presidential elections, all major challengers either bowed out, or were arrested or disqualified. The man who emerged at the last minute to run against him was an ardent supporter who won less than 4 percent of the vote.
An Irritated El-Sisi Says It’s Time the State Gets Its Due
The petition also proposed amending the constitution to ensure there is at least one vice president, revive parliament’s upper house, require that women make up at least 25 percent of parliament, and charge the military with safeguarding the state’s civilian status.

Almost 15 months after rounding up dozens of Saudi Arabia’s richest and most powerful people and imprisoning them in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has declared the raid a lucrative success.
An anti-corruption commission headed by the crown prince said a total of about $107 billion -- a mix of cash, real estate, companies and securities -- has been recovered from 87 people.
Aside from confirming a $1 billion payment from the former head of the National Guard, the government has said little about the nature of the individual settlements. Less than four months ago, the crown prince told Bloomberg News that $35 billion had been collected from the prisoners. Verifying the commission’s claims is made more challenging by the opacity of the Saudi market. Closely held companies rarely disclose financials and the value of real estate -- the preferred asset of many wealthy Saudis -- is obscured by unrecorded transactions and restrictions on buyers.
Detainees have been trickling out of prison for more than a year. Saudi-Ethiopian billionaire Mohammed Al Amoudi, was freed just last Sunday after being held in an undisclosed location on bribery and corruption charges. Also released within the past few weeks: philanthropist and former government minister Amr Al-Dabbagh; former McKinsey & Co. partner Hani Khoja; and Sami Baroum, an ex-managing director of one of the kingdom’s biggest food companies.
Authorities have constrained post-prison life for many of those targeted, with travel bans and heightened surveillance within the country.
This is the latest status of four billionaires:
Date of release: January 2018Change in net worth since day before his arrest: down $4 billion to $15 billion
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud
Arguably the most high-profile target of the crackdown, Alwaleed was released after 83 days in detention, looking thinner but praising the kingdom’s leadership. He told Bloomberg News shortly afterward that he signed a confidential “confirmed understanding” with the government and that operations at his business empire were back to normal. Shares of his investment group, Kingdom Holding Co., have dropped 22 percent since his arrest.
Alwaleed, Saudi Arabia’s richest person, has a 95 percent stake in the company that comprises half of his net worth. In October, Kingdom Holding signed a $1 billion loan, its first financing since his arrest, and the firm’s chief executive officer said last month that it’s considering spinning off some real estate investments. Alwaleed, known to be a restless globetrotter, is said to have been banned from traveling abroad. He has about $2.6 billion of assets outside the Middle East.
Date of release: January 2019Change in net worth: down $1.4 billion to $8.7 billion
Al Amoudi standing with business managers Jason Milazzo and Roger Wikstrom after his release
Al Amoudi, the nation’s second-richest person, was released Jan. 27, six weeks after Saudi officials confirmed he was being held on corruption and bribery charges and would stand trial. His fortune originated with a government contract during the reign of King Fahd and is now mostly tied to assets outside the kingdom.
He owns the biggest fuel company in Sweden and is the largest individual investor in his native Ethiopia, where he owns gold mines, hotels and agricultural tracts. While his businesses abroad continued to operate independently during his detention, the status and control of his Saudi assets -- which include a chain of gas stations and an engineering firm -- is unclear. Al Amoudi is healthy and in good spirits and has met with senior managers of his companies, according to a person close to the billionaire, who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.
Date of release: January 2018Change in net worth: down $700 million to $3 billion
Kamel, a self-made finance and health-care entrepreneur, is a pioneer of modern Islamic finance. His fortune stems from Bahrain-based Albaraka Banking Group and Dallah Albaraka, a sprawling Jeddah holding company that controls businesses spanning health care, real estate and food manufacturing.

Kamel was also one of Saudi Arabia’s earliest media magnates. In the 1970s, he founded one of the country’s first television production companies and was an early investor in Middle East Broadcasting Center, a regional media giant whose chairman, Waleed Al Ibrahim, was also detained and released in January 2018.
After the emptying of the Ritz, the government took control of 60 percent of MBC, including shares belonging to the Kamel family, while Al Ibrahim retained his 40 percent share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Released: January 2018Change in net worth: down $520 million to about $950 million
Alhokair is a co-founder and major shareholder of the Fawaz Alhokair Group, a franchise retail company he formed with his brothers in 1990. He was freed after reaching a settlement with the government, a senior official said at the time.
The company is preparing to sell 30 percent of its shares in its Arabian Centres mall unit, a listing that had previously been put on hold because of Alhokair’s arrest. Shares of the company -- of which he owns 23 percent, according to recent Saudi stock exchange filings -- have tumbled 41 percent since his detention.

Saudi-Ethiopian billionaire Mohammed Al Amoudi was released more than a year after his arrest in what authorities said was a crackdown on corruption, becoming the latest detainee to be freed under mysterious circumstances.
Al Amoudi was let go after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed raised his case during a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, the premier’s office said. A Saudi official said in December that Al Amoudi was charged with corruption and would face trial.
Al Amoudi is the third-richest billionaire in the Middle East, with a fortune valued at $8.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was no official Saudi explanation of his release and it’s unclear whether he will be barred from leaving the kingdom, like some others who were freed.
The kingdom and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman have come under unprecedented global pressure after the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents at the country’s consulate in Istanbul in October.
Several other prominent detainees were released over the past few weeks, including Amr Al-Dabbagh -- a businessman who was formerly chief of the Saudi investment authority -- and Hani Khoja, a McKinsey & Co. partner who co-founded Elixir, a consultancy. Sami Baroum, former managing director of food processor Savola Group, was also freed, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Bakr Binladin, a Saudi billionaire who had headed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group, was briefly released to attend a family funeral but sent back to prison on Sunday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Al Amoudi was detained in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel in November 2017 along with dozens of princes, officials and businessmen as Prince Mohammed declared a campaign against corruption.
Critics denounced the purge as a power play and a shakedown, a charge the government denies. While most detainees were released last year, a few high-profile figures are still being held, including former Economy Minister Adel Fakeih and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah.
It’s unclear whether those sent home recently faced any charges or have gone through a settlement process; the government has not commented on or confirmed the releases.
Al Amoudi’s arrest was of particular interest to Ethiopia, where he owns vast assets. In May, after his visit to Saudi Arabia, Ahmed said that he had inquired after Al Amoudi and was sure he’d be freed soon.
Saudi authorities have also released two male associates of a group of prominent women’s rights activists who were arrested in May. Abdulaziz Al-Meshaal, a businessman and associate of the women, was released recently, according to people familiar with the matter, while lawyer Ibrahim Al-Modaimigh was released in December.

Damac Properties PJSC’s stock has plunged by about two-thirds in the past 12 months, while Emaar Malls PJSC and Emaar Development PJSC are both down 34 percent. That performance sets them up for exclusion from the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in May under the compiler’s criteria for membership in the gauge, according to Mohamad Al Hajj, equities strategist at the research arm of EFG-Hermes Holding Co. Their departure could lead to combined investment outflows of about $220 million, he said.
The three companies are by far the worst performers in 2019 among the eight stocks on Dubai’s real estate and construction index, a gauge that’s dropped in the past year as building in the emirate outpaced expected demand growth. The housing component of Dubai’s consumer-price index has fallen for all but three months since at least May 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The recent share-price losses put the developers out of the coverage range of compiler MSCI Inc.’s main emerging-market index, which considers only large and mid-cap stocks, according to Al Hajj. Added to that is the fact that they have low free-float levels, he said. Robert Ansari, head of Middle East business at MSCI, did not respond to a request for comment.
Read: Dubai Is Achilles Heel to EM’s Worst-Performing Property Stock
The companies have the lowest weight in the MSCI U.A.E. Index, which is used for calculating the main emerging-markets gauge. If deleted, they “will no longer benefit from passive inflows into EM beyond May,” Al Hajj said in an emailed response to questions. Removal would spark outflows of $80 million each for Emaar Development and Emaar Malls, and $60 million for Damac Properties, he estimated.
Under one scenario for the review, Abu-Dhabi based Aldar Properties PJSC could be considered the U.A.E. cutoff stock, with Damac being classified as a small-cap and Emaar Malls and Emaar Development being excluded for failing free float, Al Hajj said.
However, in a second scenario, if the foreign room for another U.A.E. index member, Dana Gas, is above 25 percent at the end of the review period, Damac will end up being the cutoff, potentially saving the status of Emaar Malls and Emaar Development. While too early to confirm, as the considered date is the end of April, “Damac is looking like a high probability deletion,” Al Hajj said.
Amr Aboushaban, investor relations chief at Damac, said the company qualifies under two of MSCI’s four criteria for remaining in the emerging-market measure, and “nothing is stopping us from meeting the additional requirements” as the developer works to reduce volatility in a cyclical stock market. Damac has “remained focused on the fundamentals of our business” after expecting the real-estate slowdown, enabling it to remain liquid and “capture opportunities,” he said.

Photographer: Catherine Hyland for Bloomberg Businessweek
Switzerland's Andermatt has all the makings of an ultra-luxury ski destination.
The first time Egyptian real estate mogul Samih Sawiris took a helicopter ride over the sleepy Swiss ski village of Andermatt, 14 years ago, he was struck by its remote wildness. The resort was only a 90-minute drive from Zurich, yet it felt like a secret hidden in the mountains of Uri, arguably the rugged country’s least discovered canton.
What the silver-haired chairman of Orascom Development Holding AG must have also seen was a blank slate. The appeal of European ski resorts, unlike that of their purpose-­built American counterparts, is their sense of history. Think skiing into farming villages steeped in tradition, where the slopes and hotels and restaurants have been attracting winter tourists for—in some cases—well over a century.
Andermatt offered exactly the opposite. This was a resort that, after two boom-and-bust cycles, felt virtually empty, a veritable ghost town notched high up in a secluded pocket of the Alps. History hadn’t been kind to the valley. First the Gotthard Tunnel rerouted the railway tourists who’d once stopped here during the belle epoque. Then the Swiss military, who’d made Andermatt a big base of operations, pulled out in the 1990s, leaving the resort a husk of its former self. All that remained was a picturesque main street flanked by timber chalets and old hotels and a few antiquated lifts ferrying skiers to the tops of the towering mountains that encircle the town. No-frills free riders came for the plentiful powder and off-piste faces lining the Gemsstock, the highest lift-­serviced peak in the area, but they didn’t do much for the local economy when it came to spending money in town.
To Sawiris—whose holdings include El Gouna, an Egyptian resort town along the Red Sea with some 20,000 residents—the underdeveloped resort’s lack of infrastructure marked its appeal.
“Mr. Sawiris doesn’t only create tourism destinations, he creates towns,” says Stefan Kern, a spokesman for Andermatt Swiss Alps AG, the company Sawiris founded to transform Andermatt from a down-on-its-luck Alpine hamlet into a destination resort capable of rivaling Zermatt, St. Moritz, and Verbier.
In 2007, Sawiris proposed an audacious three-pronged resuscitation plan, one that would see more than $1 billion go toward an opulent luxury hotel and 18-hole Scottish-style golf course, a revamped and expanded ski area, and an ambitious development of holiday apartments and private chalets. To succeed at that third component—the one most critical to his bottom line—Sawiris had to find a way around a Swiss law that restricted foreigners from purchasing second homes. He did just that, getting the government to grant Andermatt an exemption as a special economic development zone. Once the town voted in favor of his plan, almost unanimously, Sawiris was off and running.
Spread out across nine ­peaked-roof chalets, the five-star 169-room Chedi opened its doors in 2013 and now forms the heart of the new Andermatt. The hotel has become a destination in and of itself for moneyed ­travelers—some skiers, some not—who want to unplug amid blissed-out luxury in the seclusion of the Swiss Alps. During a visit in early April, as the snow still dumped outside, an international array of guests milled about the sleek black-stone and timber lobby, ate farm-fresh breakfasts in the 250-­person dining room beside an open kitchen, and floated downstairs to spa appointments. There’s a 6,000-­bottle wine cellar, plus a Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant (a 10-course kaiseki menu is recommended) and, for those who can afford further seclusion, the two-floor Furka suite, which comes replete with a private spa and rents for $15,000 a night.
Still, despite its sheer size and over-the-top amenities, the Chedi doesn’t dominate Andermatt. Nor does Sawiris’s residential development on the north side of town, Andermatt Reuss, which is home to the recently opened four-star Radisson Blu hotel, a 650-seat classical music concert hall, and apartment buildings surrounding a central piazza. (Eighty percent of finished apartments have already been sold.) Instead, as you drive up the circuitous bends and through a crack in the mountains and into town, you’re greeted by the broad valley’s open snowfields, a few remaining military barracks, perhaps a red train trundling along on your right-hand side, and serrated peaks in every direction.
“Some people driving into the village don’t even realize the Chedi is there,” says Mari Russi, co-owner of Art 87 Andermatt, a contemporary gallery located just off the cobblestones of Gotthardstrasse. The hotel’s entrance “is very discreet. There’s no big sign—you really have to look for it.”
Russi hails from Sweden, but it was her Swiss husband, Bernhard Russi—Andermatt Swiss Alps board member and winner of the 1972 Olympic downhill—who introduced her to his hometown more than 30 years ago. A lot has changed since then, but like most locals she takes an all-ships-rise attitude toward Sawiris’s development. Now her clients are the type of people who won’t bat an eye at the $50,000 price tags of her gallery’s most expensive pieces.
“Everyone is happy the Chedi is here,” says Louie Gougouth, assistant manager at the Hotel Sonne, a 150-year-old ­family-owned institution that remains perhaps the most picturesque building in town. Originally from Morocco, Gougouth came to Switzerland to study at a hotel school, then wound up in Andermatt because of a job offer at a now-­defunct hotel. He stayed because of the clean air, the unspoiled mountains, and the people who say “Uela!” to you—the local ­greeting—on the street every morning.
In April the atmospheric wood-­paneled dining room at the 20-room Sonne was still busy, as it had been all season, with a mix of German and British families huddled around piping hot pots of fondue. “In the beginning it was just military,” Gougouth says, reflecting on his first years in Andermatt. “We were just seeing green, green, green, because of the uniforms. But now we see people from around the world. Even celebrities. Singers from the USA, golf players. This year we saw 50% growth over last year,” he says.
Making good on his plan to expand the ski area, Sawiris pumped $140 million into ­on-mountain infrastructure in only three years. Last season a gleaming eight-person gondola replaced a couple of old chairs; it now whisks skiers to the top of the Gütsch peak, from which they can ski a network of gentle and intermediate slopes before taking another new 10-person gondola into the neighboring resort of Sedrun, in the canton of Graubünden.
The most seasoned of skiers still lap off-piste runs from the Gemsstock’s cable car, but the multigenerational clans who now come to Andermatt make their migration east each morning toward Sedrun, skiing far above the tree line in the high alpine, partaking in that grand, stress-free European ski experience of lazily schussing from village to village.
All told, the interconnected ski area will boast 112 miles of slopes and 33 lifts. That’s two lifts more than Vail, Colo. A further lift connection will open during the 2019-20 winter season, allowing guests to ski all the way to the rolling, family-friendly slopes of Disentis.
Sawiris’s “if you build it, they will come” attitude appears to be working. Last season, Andermatt almost doubled its ­single-day skier record, attracting 12,000 guests. (Given the size of the expanded resort, that means the slopes were still relatively uncrowded.) But this growth isn’t necessarily what all locals want.
“The core atmosphere of the town is gone, it’s dead, it doesn’t exist anymore,” says Kevin Obschlager, who along with his wife owns the River House, a red-­shingled boutique hotel and whiskey bar that opened more than a decade ago and catered to the hardcore skiers who flocked to Andermatt for its soulful atmosphere.
Obschlager likens Andermatt’s genesis—or perhaps downfall—to that of Telluride, which went from funky hippie hideaway to posh enclave, attracting Tom Cruise, Ralph Lauren, Oprah Winfrey, and other celebrities: “Now it’s luxury, luxury, luxury. Before, this place would be packed with smiling faces after powder days. People would come every weekend.” He shrugs. “Now people come once, and then they’re gone—they go to the Caribbean the next weekend.”
During the visit in April at least, Andermatt still felt undiscovered and refreshingly unpretentious. Snow fell at night, a ghostly mist hung among the narrow cobbled lanes cutting through town, and the few remaining military cadets filed into bars or shared cigarettes under the milky glow of streetlights. The slopes were equally uncrowded, and from the summit of the Gemsstock, with 3 feet of fresh snow blanketing the 5,000 feet of vertical leading to the valley, and the rugged mountains of Uri standing like sentinels keeping the rest of the world at bay, one thing was certain: The time to book your trip is most certainly now.

Some, like BP Plc CEO Bob Dudley and Tesco Plc CEO Dave Lewis, are handing over after years spent transforming their energy and retail empires to cope with the tectonic forces of environmental issues and online shopping. Others, like Alison Cooper at Imperial Brands, a tobacco company, are stepping down because they didn’t adapt to changing markets.
The players in a week of big changes:
The Record: Dudley will retire as CEO of BP early next year, a long-anticipated step after more than nine years running the energy giant. He took the helm during BP’s darkest period, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and is widely credited with rescuing the company from that disaster.
Investor View: BP shares have risen about 11% during his tenure, compared with a 27% return for the FTSE 100, and production is growing again.
Succession and Outlook: Dudley is succeeded by Bernard Looney, BP’s upstream chief, who faces an immediate challenge – whether to pivot the company toward cleaner, but typically less profitable forms of energy, or focus on fossil fuels even as demand growth slows.
The Record: Lewis was hailed as the man who fixed Tesco. He guided the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain back to health from a massive accounting scandal that came to light weeks after he took over in 2014. Lewis  streamlined Tesco, closing U.K. fresh-food counters and pulling back from international markets like South Korea and Turkey. His acquisition of wholesaler Booker has reduced the company’s exposure to the troubled British retail market as consumers shift spending online.
Investor View: Tesco shares have returned about 1.4% a year under Lewis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 5% average annual gain for the FTSE 100.
Succession and Outlook: Lewis is handing over to Ken Murphy of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., a surprise choice. When he takes over next year, Murphy will need to keep frisky discounters Aldi and Lidl at bay. Beyond that, he’ll need a strategy for the technological revolution that’s upending retail, including mining a trove of customer data to boost Tesco’s online business.
The Record: Cooper’s nine-year stint in charge of Imperial Brands Plc got off to a strong start but fizzled as the owner of Gauloise cigarettes and Blu vaping devices failed to keep up with bigger rivals and nimbler developers of smoking alternatives like Juul Labs Inc. Under Cooper, Imperial expanded its presence in the U.S. by acquiring the Winston and Kool brands. But the backlash against vaping prompted a profit warning, fueling investor unrest and hastening her departure.
Investor View: Imperial Brands shares have returned 4.9% a year under Cooper, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 7.1% average annual gain for the FTSE 100.
Succession and Outlook: An incoming CEO, yet to named, will have to navigate the storm over vaping while accelerating the company’s overhaul. Imperial Brands has been trying without success to sell its premium cigar business, and investors are calling for greater transparency over its finances.
The Record: Martin Gilbert is leaving as vice chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen Plc, the asset manager he helped found more than three decades ago. Gilbert lost his grip on power earlier this year when a dual CEO structure, in place since the company was created by a 2017 merger, was scrapped; Keith Skeoch became the sole chief executive.
Investor View: Standard Life Aberdeen  has plunged 29% since Aug. 8, 2017, the day the merged company’s shares began trading. This compares with a 3.1% gain in the FTSE 100 since that date. 
Succession and Outlook: Skeoch has a tough task. Big name active money managers are charging too much for mediocre returns, and many investors have shifted to passive funds that track benchmark stock and bond indexes and offer much lower fees. What started as a trickle has turned into a flood, forcing fees lower and triggering consolidation and job losses.
The Record: Hill’s role as chairman of Metro Bank Plc was under scrutiny since the start of the year, when the lender said it had incorrectly classified hundreds of millions of pounds of mortgages, failing to set aside enough capital to cover risks. That surprise led to questions about the 10-year-old bank’s viability, then to calls for Hill – Metro’s co-founder – to go.
Investor View:  Metro Bank was a star performer, touching a high of a little over 40 pounds ($49.39) last year, easily outperforming the U.K.’s blue chip stock index. By the beginning of 2019 they had halved, and since the loan misclassification announcement the stock has lost about 90% of its value.
Succession and Outlook: The bank is looking for a sucessor to Hill. Metro’s attraction was its growth strategy, and getting this back on track will be his or her priority. Speculation has mounted in recent weeks that the bank may not be able to outrun its problems and might be sold. Metro has said so far that it’s considering asset sales to repair its finances.

The companies are already under intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who has said he wants to ban all flavored devices; the Food and Drug Administration; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and two House committees. In addition, Massachusetts, San Francisco, Michigan, and New York are moving to ban sales, and multiple state attorneys general are investigating whether Juul violated consumer protection laws by marketing to people under age 18.

The companies will be required to show their sales tactics don’t hurt the public health, or they could face marketing restrictions under a proposed FDA rule.
Juul says it is facing 55 lawsuits in more than 20 states. The FDA has warned the company it may have violated the law by claiming its devices are safe.

Alison Cooper took tobacco out of Imperial Brands’s name, but couldn’t shift its dependence away from traditional cigarettes fast enough. Her successor will have to.
Imperial’s next CEO will need to see through the smoke.
Imperial Brands Plc’s Alison Cooper is stepping down in a cloud of raspberry scented smoke.
The timing isn’t surprising. It comes exactly a week after the British-based maker of Davidoff cigarettes and the Blu electronic device,  lowered expectations for sales and profits after taking a hit in the U.S. vaping market. The warning brought to a head discussions about the company’s future leadership as the board conducts its search for a successor to Chairman Mark Williamson.Change is clearly needed. The shares of the smallest of the world’s major tobacco companies are roughly back where they were at the start of Cooper’s 9-year watch, having lost more than half of their value since a 2016 peak.Her successor faces a tall order. The new CEO will have to figure out how to make Imperial a strong force in tobacco alternatives. It currently ranks fourth in electronic smoking devices by units sold on a four-week basis. But in the heat-not-burn segment, its Pulze product is a relative newcomer in the Japanese market, where the products have taken hold more quickly than elsewhere. It’s important to have a clear strategy in each segment since no one really knows exactly where the market’s headed.Finding the right path forward won’t be easy, given the crisis engulfing vaping in the U.S., which has prompted efforts by President Donald Trump to ban flavored products and nicotine pads while some retailers including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes.

They must find a way through this. One option would be developing a boarder suite of tobacco alternatives alongside Imperial’s Blu vaping device. Stepping up development in heat-not-burn segment would also be wise.
Rival British American Tobacco Plc has hedged its bets, with a presence in both vaping and the heat-not-burn segment. This is a model that Imperial should follow. But this would likely mean more investment.
Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, says Imperial can afford to spend more. First of all, it’s core business of traditional cigarettes ­ — including local brands such as Winston in the U.S. — is cash generative. Plus, its 2 billion-pound ($2.5 billion) asset disposal program and decision to abandon its policy to increase its dividend by 10% annually should give it scope to act.
The new chairman must also address corporate governance issues. Bloomberg News reported that investors and analysts had voiced concerns about Imperial’s earnings calculations and strategy.

Imperial has long been seen as a takeover target, but it is now particularly vulnerable given the share price weakness and that industry consolidation is back on the agenda, even after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks.
Japan Tobacco Inc. is often mooted as the likely predator, although it would have to find a way to deal with competition constraints.
If the new chairman and chief executive don’t raise their game on alternatives, then someone else might light up even more radical change for them.

Imperial Brands Plc said Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper is stepping down from the U.K. tobacco company, a week after it warned that sales of cigarette alternatives are falling short of expectations.
The maker of Blu vaping devices said Cooper, who has been in the top job for nine years, will leave once a successor is found. She is the second CEO to announce a departure from a blue-chip British company in two days, after Tesco Plc’s Dave Lewis on Wednesday.
Imperial shares rose as much as 2.4% early Thursday in London.
The company said last week that earnings growth ground to a halt in the latest 12 months after a drastic slowdown in revenue from smoking alternatives and weak cigarette sales. That came after the outbreak of a mystery illnesses linked to vaping led to a U.S. crackdown on the practice.
Under Cooper, 53, Imperial has struggled to keep up with bigger rivals like British American Tobacco Plc in the world of e-cigarettes and devices that heat tobacco rather than burning it. Upstart Juul Labs Inc., at the center of the storm over vaping in the U.S., also stole a march on the established players.
Imperial, the smallest of the major international tobacco companies, has yet to find a buyer for its premium cigar business, after it announced plans for a sale earlier this year.
The shares have fallen more than 20% this year. After a runup that ended in 2016, they’re roughly back to the level when Cooper took over in 2010. Her departure continues a leadership overhaul that began earlier this year when Imperial said it was seeking a successor to Chairman Mark Williamson.
Cooper’s move follows Bloomberg’s story on a confidential report by financial communications adviser Tulchan, arguing for more financial transparency at the company, after investors and analysts voiced concerns over its accounting.
In June, Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg slammed Imperial’s earnings calculations, saying the company includes non-operational factors such as gains from asset sales and uses that definition of profit as a factor in setting executive bonuses.
“It’s time for a clean sheet and a new management team,” said Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment Management.
Investors have also expressed concern with Imperial’s commitment to smaller, local brands at a time when smoking is in decline. While she has streamlined the portfolio in some areas, the company four years ago expanded its U.S. operations with the acquisition of Winston, Kool, Salem and Maverick cigarettes. 
“Alison has driven a sharper focus on Imperial’s strongest brands and markets, halving the number of cigarette brands to ensure a higher quality of growth,” Williamson said in a statement."

As the Food and Drug Administration’s plan to restrict the e-cigarette industry takes shape, driven by a spate of vaping-related illnesses, cigarette sales aren’t yet reflecting smokers’ concerns that vapes might not be the safer alternative to traditional smoking that marketing campaigns were built around.
Sales trends for the past month, including the period since the FDA’s Sept. 11 announcement that it would pursue a ban on flavored vapes, suggest that the combustible cigarette market has yet to see a boost in demand following the Centers for Disease Control’s public health warnings about vaping. Sales of e-cigarettes have slowed, meanwhile, as regulators weigh their options to regulate the nascent phenomenon.
Fitch Ratings said in a report Thursday that it expects “significantly slower growth” in vaping in the short term given tighter regulations. In the long term, Fitch said tougher rules could benefit larger tobacco manufacturers, as consumers pivot to “closed systems” that are generally viewed as safer products.
Recent IRI data show that cigarette volume declines for the four-week period ending Sept. 22 stayed “roughly unchanged” from the prior four weeks, at down 7.7%. Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery said he was “surprised that cigarette volume trends did not yet show a more obvious benefit from sequential vapor declines”.
Similarly, Wells Fargo says the latest Nielsen data suggests cigarette industry volume declines moderated only slightly, to down 6.7% in the four weeks ended Sept. 21, against a 12-week contraction of 7%. Analyst Bonnie Herzog continues to believe that more bad news for e-cigarettes, as well as an FDA ban, could still result in improved cigarette volumes, as vapers potentially return to cigarette smoking -- which is “not the FDA’s desired outcome.”
Growth in tobacco alternatives “may be deferred a little,” says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Duncan Fox, adding that several more months of weakness need to be seen “before a panic from tobacco companies.”
As several states move to ban flavored vapes that appeal to teenagers, traditional cigarettes are likely to benefit, but “the growth will not be linear,” Fox says. New devices are likely to spur growth in the industry, and the market for heat-not-burn, vapor and cannabis, will probably remain “the growth engine for a heavily regulated industry for some time.”
For now, e-cigarette sales are already slowing, and Juul, in particular, is suffering from a crackdown after the FDA accused it of illegally marketing e-cigarettes as less harmful than traditional cigarettes. IRI data show an 11% decline in e-cigarette sales in the four-week period ending Sept. 22, while Nielsen suggested e-cigarette sales volumes rose about 38% in the latest 12 weeks, slowing from growth of 48% in the prior period.

The decline was led by Juul, which most “feels the pressure” from the recent crackdown together with increased competition, said Wells Fargo’s Herzog. Juul’s dollar share, which declined sequentially, has been picked up by competing e-cigarette companies Blu, NJOY, Vuse and Logic, she said.
But there are still a lot of unknowns, analysts say. “The numbers have fallen as retailers have stopped selling,” said BI’s Fox. “Whether that is what is actually happening, though, is tough to know,” since sales over the internet or at small shops, for instance, may not be reflected in the data.
“Stronger regulation is needed, fast,” Fox said. “I can see why the FDA is taking some time to get it right. Get it wrong and they may make things worse.”"

Sony’s PlayStation Now subscriptions number less than 1% of all PS4s sold. Above: Milan Games Week.
Sony Corp. has halved the price of its PlayStation Now subscription games service. Competition from console rival Nintendo Co. as well as new offerings from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc. are the obvious reasons.
In addition, though, PlayStation Now failed to live up to its potential. At $19.99 per month,
            

                1
            
        the product was way overpriced. After four years, Sony has just 700,000 paid subscribers. That’s less than 1% of the 96.8 million PlayStation 4 units the company sold by the end of March.
As Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft Corp. enjoy loyalty and ongoing revenue streams from subscribing services for games, both Apple and Google enjoy a clear advantage in something far more valuable: attention.
What these companies are really competing for isn’t share of the games market but consumer time. A minute watching Netflix or swiping Tinder is a minute not spent playing GTA or Super Mario Kart. 
In that respect, Google and Apple are both able to grab user attention multiple times per day thanks to their iOS and Android smartphones. Even Nintendo’s handheld Switch can’t compete.
Sony has the potential to push growth even faster in its games network as it fends off subscription rivals
Source: Sony

Complicating the matter for Now is Sony’s own rival offering,: PlayStation Plus, which goes for $9.99 per month. Now is a streaming service like those provided by Netflix Inc. or Spotify Technology SA, while Plus is more of a community that allows online multiplayer games, offers just two free PS4 titles per month, and provides some other benefits.
By cutting Now to $9.99 per month, Sony’s gross margins and average selling price on that service will suffer. Yet the unit economics mean that longer-term revenue and operating profit in this division can expand. By my reckoning, Sony should be able to hit 1.5 million paid Now members by the end of September 2020; if not, then I would consider PlayStation Now a failed product that needs to be reassessed.
As proof, we can look at Plus. It offers a lesser games catalog than Now, albeit with other compelling features, but had 36.4 million subscribers at the end of March – that’s 50 times more than Now. Price is a major factor in users’ purchase of a subscription, according to Nielsen Co.’s Superdata. So with that hurdle lowered, Now ought to be attractive enough to get the same level of attention.
Yet if loyal consumers want both access to the deepest catalog of games, and interactive features and other benefits, they shouldn’t be forced to shell out twice. Instead of milking customers, Sony would be better served by either folding Now and Plus into one service or offering a steep discount to have both.
This isn’t just out of fairness to customers, but a matter of survival.  Nintendo’s Switch Online is just $3.99 while Microsoft has Xbox Game Pass at $9.99. Apple’s Arcade is $4.99, and Google’s Stadia costs $9.99. By asking for double its nearest rival, Sony is throwing away the advantage it enjoys by having a superior product for the sake of a few dollars more. That’s reminiscent of its failures with Memory Stick storage cards and BluRay DVDs, mistakes it ought not to repeat.
Sony cut the price of its Now games service from $19.99 to be more in line with rivals

Note: This is a selection of offerings, services may not be equivalent. Discounts may be offered for longer subscriptions.
With five big names now offering games subscriptions, it’s clear that the business model is evolving beyond single-unit sales. By selling all-you-can-eat packages, Netflix and Spotify schooled Apple at a time when the iPhone maker was still charging per song and per movie.
Sony can also learn from Netflix and Home Box Office Inc. that offering competitive set-price packages doesn’t mean you need to forgo blockbuster titles. In fact, Sony’s access to the highest-quality games is the moat that rivals will struggle to cross.
The move toward games subscriptions will be good for the entire industry by bringing in more total revenue. That also makes it Sony’s battle to lose.

The year keeps getting worse for Imperial Brands Plc shares, 2019’s biggest decliner among European personal and household-goods stocks, as a backlash against smoking alternatives batters the tobacco industry.
The stock suffered a blow on Thursday after the company revised down its full-year revenue forecast and earnings expectations, citing a deterioration in the U.S. vaping market. That follows underwhelming results in May, when first-half sales for next-generation products missed analysts’ expectations.
Imperial Brands shares have lost about a third of their value since reaching a 12-month high in November, a few days after the U.K. maker of Blu vaping devices announced additional investment in its next-generation products, which have been touted as a future driver of growth.
“The category remains unprofitable but management expect it to reach breakeven in 2020, which we believe is unlikely,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Sanath Sudarsan wrote in a note. “Imperial provided little comfort on the underlying business model.”

The warning from the maker of Blu vaping devices adds to the fallout from a backlash against e-cigarettes that has already scuttled the biggest potential merger in the industry. Imperial’s shares plunged 13% on Thursday, wiping out more than $3 billion of market value. 
“It calls Imperial Brands’ and the tobacco industry’s longer-term business model into question,” said James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC. “The implications should not be under-estimated.”
Early Signs of Vaping Health Risks Were Missed or Ignored
Imperial’s warning comes a day after Altria Group Inc. abandoned talks on a possible merger with Philip Morris International Inc. and installed one of its own executives at the helm of embattled e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. U.S. health officials are scrambling to identify a mystery illness linked to vaping, denting prospects for what had become one of the biggest new growth markets in the industry. Consumers are now questioning the devices, touted to carry fewer health risks than traditional cigarettes.
Imperial Brands, the smallest of the major tobacco companies, has lost more than half its market value from a 2016 peak. With a tighter research budget than rivals, the company has struggled to keep up with devices such as Juul and Philip Morris’s IQOS, which heats tobacco without burning it. After years of shrugging off that market in favor of vaping products, Imperial recently introduced its first heated-tobacco device in Japan.
Imperial’s smoking-alternative business remains unprofitable but will move toward breaking even through 2020, Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper said on a call with investors. The U.K.-based company, which sells Winston cigarettes in the U.S., said earnings per share were roughly flat at constant currencies and sales rose about 2% in the 12 months through September.
“It will be bumpy over the coming months, and there may be some short-term pain,” Cooper said. Regulation will weed out the industry, leaving a few responsible companies, she added. “Therefore there will be a much better competitive environment.”
The Trump administration said earlier this month that it would soon remove all flavored e-cigarette nicotine pods from the market, and only allow them back in stores after they gained approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Several U.S. states have moved to restrict vaping, and Walmart Inc. has decided to stop selling e-cigarettes in its home market.
The entire industry has been shuddering, not just the small independent vape companies that may have a harder time dealing with stricter policies from the FDA. In the past month, British American Tobacco Plc said that it plans to cut 2,300 jobs and Japan Tobacco Inc. announced it will eliminate 3,720 positions.
BAT shares fell as much as 4.8% Thursday.
Imperial’s sales of smoking alternatives rose about 50% this fiscal year, slowing from the breakneck 200% pace of the first half. The company also cited a tougher market for tobacco in countries such as Australia.
Several potential buyers have expressed interest in its premium cigar business, Imperial also said. The company has put the unit up for sale as part of a plan to raise as much as 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) from asset disposals.

Imperial Brands, maker of Winstons and Blu e-cigarettes, has cut its profit guidance. Things are looking pretty bleak for Big Tobacco.
Feeling Blu.
The crisis engulfing the American vaping industry has claimed its first European victim. Imperial Brands Plc, the British-based maker of Winston cigarettes in the U.S. and the Blu electronic device, cut its sales and profit guidance on Thursday, a day after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks amid increasing Washington scrutiny of illnesses associated with the smoking alternative.
Imperial in part blamed a slowdown in U.S. demand for electronic cigarettes for its expectation of flat earnings in the year to Sept. 30. It had anticipated expansion of between 4% and 8%. Revenue will expand by 2%, at the low end of its 1% to 4% range. The shares fell as much as 11%.
Some American retailers, including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes, while President Donald Trump is moving to ban flavored products and nicotine pods. All of this came together to weigh on Imperial’s sales in the final quarter, when it was also running a big marketing campaign for its Blu device.
So far the problems haven’t spread to Europe or Japan (the most developed market for devices that heat rather than burn tobacco). Imperial expects sales of its new generation products to increase by 50% this year. That may look eye-watering but it’s below previous expectations.

This is a worry for all of Big Tobacco, which is investing billions of pounds in innovative new products. Philip Morris has developed the iQos “heat not burn” device, while British American Tobacco Plc has a suite of alternatives.
The idea is that manufacturers use the cash flows from their traditional cigarettes business to develop products they describe as lower risk. As smoking rates decline, these devices are meant to pick up the slack among consumers. The transition hasn’t been smooth. Growth slowed in Japan last year, where older people proved more reluctant to follow tech-savvy early adopters of alternatives.
The scrutiny in the U.S. is clearly a serious problem for this potentially huge, but nascent market. Yet there’s an irony too: The crackdown on vaping might drive some of the adults who’ve switched to vapes back to cigarettes.
While tobacco alternatives have huge potential, cigarettes are still the main driver of the industry

Note: Tobacco alternatives include smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes and devices that heat, rather than burn tobacco.
Although gross profit margins on alternatives are approaching those of cigarettes, according to Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the traditional product remains the driver of profit and cash flow for the industry. A slower decline in the numbers of traditional tobacco smokers would be terrible for public health, but it might end up easing some of the financial pressure on Big Tobacco, at least in the short term. While the industry has always been a big dividend payer, there have been increasing doubts about whether this is sustainable.
Tobacco stocks have underperformed the market this year

Note: Normalized as of 12/31/2018
Greater regulation of alternatives could also play to the big companies’ advantage. Most — though not all — of the individuals who’ve fallen ill used black-market vaping pods. A tightening of the rules could favor the devices made by large manufacturers, which have decades of experience lobbying lawmakers. These companies have deep pockets for research and development too.
Nevertheless, unless the industry can develop alternatives that are genuinely less harmful, the outlook for what was Big Tobacco’s last great hope looks bleak. Expect more vaping dreams to go up in smoke.
