       " <p>Mock meat is one option.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In 2018, China's plant-based meat industry was worth $910 million — up 14.2% from a year earlier, according to a report by <a alt=\"\" aria-label=\"\" class=\"\" data-type=\"\" href=\"https://www.gfi.org/new-gfi-report-illustrates-the-state-of-chinas\" rel=\"\" role=\"\" tabindex=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">U.S.-based Good Food Institute</a>.

       " <p>The deadly disease might have led to a 20 million ton drop in China's pork market, according to Powell. On this decrease, consumers could turn to mock meat as an alternative.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"I think there could be tremendous pull through for alternative protein, alternative meat here,\" he told CNBC last Wednesday.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Another factor behind the mock meat trend is Chinese cuisine, Fitch Solutions said in their report. That's because plant-based mock meats, made of tofu or wheat-based seitan, are already<strong> </strong>traditionally used in Chinese dishes.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In fact, some say that the Chinese began eating alternative meat as early as the Tang Dynasty, more than a thousand years ago.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"The fake meat trend can be viewed as the next step in this tradition as opposed to a completely new development,\" the report said.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Environmental, ethical, and health concerns may also be behind the growing demand for fake meat in China, the Fitch report noted. </p>,\n",
       " <p>Chinese millennials and flexitarians — or people who reduce their meat intake for health or environmental reasons — could lead the way for alternative meat, Powell told CNBC.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Despite this trend, it could be a while before mock meat consumption in China becomes widespread.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"One would never assume that it would be on a mass scale,\" Powell said, adding that pork, in particular, is important to the Chinese everyday diet and national psyche.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Chinese demand for meat has historically been high.
