record of the integrated resort that -pron- ve build   city of dreams macau   studio city macau   city of dreams manila and even city of dreams mediterranean   -pron- re all top resort within the market that -pron- re in and -pron- feel that -pron- s always important to attract tourist to a country   but even more importantly -pron- have to attract the right tourist   on average -pron- guest at -pron- resort spend 2 time as much at -pron- resort and also stay longer than -pron- competitor across the street or just next to -pron-      c   so -pron- understand -pron- re look to build with a local japanese partner and -pron- ve have some discussion   how be talk come along   any progress      l   -pron- ve meet many japanese corporate in different industry and there s be a lot of company that can add value   but at the same time -pron- ne to wait for the national government because the ir implementation bill have just be submit to the diet and so -pron- ne to wait for the national government to decide what city because there be different partner and -pron- strength be in particular city   so the talk be still very preliminary at this stage because honestly -pron- know 3 place   -pron- suspect that 2 of those place be go to be mega metropolitan city and 1 regional and -pron- interest naturally be in the big city   because -pron- want to build the great   most amazing   most technologically advanced integrated resort ever and only the mega city have that tourism appeal      c   so which city be -pron- gun for      l   well -pron- think right now -pron- re look at various city because even within the city and the prefecture   -pron- re compete amongst -pron- for the 3 slot that the national government have decide   -pron- think a front runner certainly be osaka in the kansai region   -pron- m sure there s go to be a candidate city in the kanto region   very likely to be yokohama or somewhere close to the tokyo airport but not within tokyo   and then the regional city be very likely hokkaido or nagasaki or even okinawa      c   so -pron- re favor osaka      l   -pron- like osaka or yokohama   kansai or kanto equally and because -pron- think at either one of those place the tourism appeal and the infrastructure be there to enable -pron- to build a 10 billion usd plus resort      c   so -pron- re talk in the meantime to these local japanese company whom -pron- re look to tie up with   but aren t -pron- competitor also do the same thing      l   well   absolutely   -pron- think for the last few year sometimes visit japanese company be like speed date because -pron- be literally in the lobby and then -pron- see -pron- competitor come out of the meeting room and then -pron- go in      c   so what be -pron- do to win -pron- japanese partner over      l   well   -pron- think   again what -pron- tell -pron- be look at the track record   for whatev reason in the gaming entertainment industry   partnership never work   if -pron- look at -pron- competitor   steve wynn and okada   sheldon adelson and galaxy   -pron- always end very   very badly in lawsuit   and   and -pron- think -pron- have have a track record of great partnership um across the board   to begin with in macau be a partnership between -pron- and james packer of crown   in philippines   -pron- have a great partner   -pron- continue to have a great partnership with the sm and belle group and in cyprus again -pron- have great partner with the cns group so -pron- work well with people and -pron- think a lot of that be because of -pron- canadian upbringing   because -pron- m an easy go   ultra open minded liberal guy      c   so -pron- re sell the good point   would -pron- consider take a minority stake in the venture      l   well   -pron- think -pron- s really subject to the condition but -pron- would think that   traditionally when -pron- look at the ir bidding process   the ir developer be the lead   so -pron- re not completely against -pron- but that would not be -pron- preference   so -pron- really depend on the consortium   if there be many member in the consortium and there be no other way for -pron- than to be a minority then -pron- may consider -pron-      c   have -pron- do the math   how long will -pron- take for -pron- to recoup -pron- 10 billion dollar investment in japan      l   assume the whole legislation process go very smoothly without any hiccup   but in japan the culture be consensus build so -pron- re still do a lot of groundwork   there s consensus building at the national level   the prefecture level and the city level with all the key stakeholder   the chamber of commerce   all of which -pron- continue to have dialogue with   so -pron- think the early that the bidding can even take place be probably 2020 or 2021   and if -pron- build an integrated resort with japan s dedication to quality and -pron- building method in term of perfection   -pron- s probably go to be a    in macau -pron- build these great building for 3 and a half   4 year so -pron- think in japan -pron- s probably go to be 5 or 5 and a half year   so the soonest that an integrated resort will open in japan -pron- think would be in 2025   usually with these mega building the payback be probably 3 to 5 year and -pron- think in japan -pron- ll be long      c   so -pron- re look at 10 year at least      l   well   -pron- wouldn t say 10 year   but definitely longer than -pron- typical asian development   for instance   singapore have probably a payback of 4 year and -pron- think japan will be long but the potential be so great that -pron- s worth the wait      c   -pron- ve say openly that if -pron- be to win a japan license   -pron- would actually move -pron- headquarters to japan   now that s a strong commitment to make   be -pron- serious about -pron-      l   -pron- think -pron- would certainly move to japan   and -pron- ve already speak to -pron- wife   -pron- love japan      c   -pron- ve get -pron- consensus      l   yes   -pron- love japan and -pron- s happy to move tomorrow and so -pron- would definitely move there to build up the resort and to make sure that -pron- s operate to the very high quality      c   right now the bulk of -pron- revenue still come from macau   -pron- actually own and operate about 3   of resort here in the city   give the amount of money that -pron- spend in japan and give the same amount of money that -pron- spend in japan as -pron- do in macau do -pron- have the potential to overtake macau in term of revenue and earning one day      l   no   -pron- think at the end of the day from a revenue standpoint   macau will always be the high grossing gaming market anywhere globally and that s why -pron- re extremely grateful   part of the reason why -pron- build morpheus as well be really as a thank -pron- for the support that -pron- ve get from china and also from macau   so -pron- don t think japan will ever be at the same level as macau in term of revenue   but -pron- ll have to see   -pron- think there s a license rebidd renewal process that will happen in macau and so -pron- really ne to see what the tax rate   or what be the renewal rebidd um condition in due course      c   but -pron- still expect macau to be the bulk of the revenue      l   absolutely   macau at the peak in 2013 be a 45b usd market and -pron- think in that same year las vegas be maybe 6 billion   so macau be 7 time las vegas and even today macau be probably 5 6 time the size of las vegas which be the next big market     c   the opening of morpheus also coincide with a pickup in macau s gaming revenue after what s be a tough few year   what s -pron- outlook like now   be a meaningful recovery in place      l   absolutely   -pron- ve have 20   21 straight month of growth and -pron- think at the same time when the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge open up -pron- will be a transformational event for macau so -pron- think that the future be very bright for macau and also for the entire region      c   -pron- macau license actually expire sometime between 2020 and 2022   be -pron- confident of an extension      l   -pron- re very confident   -pron- think -pron- have do more for macau than any of -pron- competitor   -pron- didn t have to spend 10 billion dollar in macau but -pron- do   and in term of listen to -pron-   in term of um non gaming diversification   -pron- think even when the macau government have a midterm review back 2 or 3 year ago just to see the state of thing in the market   if -pron- weren t the top   top grader   -pron- be indeed the first or second   so -pron- re very proud of that fact and -pron- continue to fine tune -pron- craft      c   last year -pron- end -pron- decade long relationship with australia s james packer   what happen   be there a big disagreement between the both of -pron-      l   not at all   james and -pron- be still very   very good friend   -pron- consider -pron- brother and -pron- think -pron- be just at a point in in time where james want to focus on -pron- domestic australian asset and -pron- want to continue to grow so -pron- be very happy and amicable unlike the other gaming partnership dissolve that -pron- see in the industry   -pron- be   there be no yelling or anything -pron- be just very happy   and to be honest with james -pron- wouldn t hesitate for a second to partner with -pron- again on another project      c   so if -pron- have keep that partnership go   -pron- would have be interested in japan      l   -pron- be   -pron- be definitely do japan together   -pron- be in japan a lot have meeting together      c   so just to be clear   the conviction of -pron- staff in china have nothing to do with the break up      l   well   -pron- s hard for -pron- to say what cause -pron- change of view on china   james be   and -pron- feel bad for james because -pron- be such a huge supporter of china   -pron- speak so highly of -pron- for an australian   for a foreigner   -pron- speak very highly of the future of the chinese economy and the relationship   -pron- be try to bridge the relationship between australia and china   so -pron- feel really bad for -pron- and -pron- don t know the detail of what have happen with -pron- local operating team because -pron- run -pron- marketing team separately   but -pron- could have have an impact   -pron- honestly don t know but -pron- think james with what be go on   and melco wasn t the only asset that -pron- divest   -pron- divest -pron- hollywood asset to really focus on bring down debt   and focus on -pron- domestic asset      c   last year in 2017   melco post a strong year in term of growth   in term of revenue   in term of earning   what s -pron- outlook for the company this year   how do -pron- expect to do      l   of course   melco and the whole gaming industry have 2 very tough year between 2015 and 2016 when china have -pron- anti extravagance   anti corruption campaign      c   painful year      l   -pron- be a very painful year   but at the same time -pron- always look at thing   from a glass half full or half empty   -pron- ll always look at half full and -pron- think that allow -pron- to be a lot more efficient   that get -pron- to really focus on kaizen   and -pron- look at everything from -pron- purchasing practice to -pron- labor practice      c   so -pron- be reinvent -pron-      l   -pron- reinvent -pron-   -pron- take out a lot of cost out from the business but at the same time -pron- didn t affect the ultimate guest experience and that be the most important thing      c   so last year 2017 be a good year for -pron- in term of earning and in term of revenue   how do -pron- expect to do this year   will -pron- be a good year for -pron-      l   -pron- will   the mix of ebitda have improve drastically over the last few year because as -pron- mention earlier vip use to account for 70   of the market and mass be 30   but -pron- ebitda margin on vip be 10   and -pron- mass margin be 40   so -pron- 4 time   and give the makeshift change in the business model   -pron- earning be much healthy now than -pron- be previously   and what s even better be the fact that -pron- ve always be one of the least reliant company on the vip or junket business and so -pron- control -pron- own destiny if -pron- continue to treat -pron- guest well      c   that s -pron- payback      l   yes   as long as -pron- continue to exceed -pron- expectation   give -pron- amazing cool product like morpheus   a cool gaming experience and cool attraction   then -pron- think -pron- ll continue to do well      c   any plan to expand further in the philippines      l   -pron- re look at potentially expand   -pron- think there be contiguous land around where -pron- resort be so -pron- be look at expand together with -pron- philippines partner but again   still early day      c   -pron- father be well known casino mogul   -pron- s 96 year old   stanley ho   -pron- found sjm holdings um -pron- be the one that hold a 3 decade monopoly here in macau   what s -pron- like to be -pron- eldest son try to build -pron- own gambling empire      l   -pron- s be fun for -pron- because -pron- colleague and -pron-   -pron- ve really build this thing from the ground up      c   in the last 10   12 year look back   any mistake   any lesson learn along the way      l   well   ton   ton of mistake      c   name -pron- 1     l   well   -pron- think -pron- be one of the cool mistake that -pron- ever make and -pron- have a lot of fun do -pron- but -pron- be when -pron- spend 75 million dollar do a short film to promote the city of dreams manila   studio city macau s opening and also what -pron- be go to do in japan   -pron- have the cool director in martin scorsese   leo dicaprio   brad pitt   and robert deniro so -pron- be a really cool project but for 75 million usd -pron- spend more money on that than scorsese s movie about casino      c   so on hindsight      l   -pron- be still really cool   hahaha      c   well   build -pron- own gambling empire -pron- have also mean that -pron- have to compete with -pron- very own father   sjm   not to mention -pron- sister who run mgm china   what s -pron- like to compete with family   do thing ever get personal      l   no   not really because -pron- all do -pron- own thing   -pron- s an ultra competitive industry and the key be -pron- just focu on -pron- own venture and -pron- have great team that that help -pron-   but at the dinner table when -pron- do have family gathering -pron- s nothing but laugh     c   what sort of relationship do -pron- have with -pron- father   have -pron- say anything to -pron- about -pron- achievement at melco      l   well   -pron- father have a very serious accident around 9 year ago and so -pron- think -pron- s take -pron- very easy in the last 9 year   the bulk of -pron- building for city of dreams   studio city manila   cyprus or even -pron- venture in russia be post -pron- accident so -pron- haven t have a lot of dialogue in term of what -pron- build   but -pron- think -pron- s very similar to when -pron- get into the industry in the 60 and -pron- hold the monopoly for 40 year   -pron- revolutionize the gaming industry in macau   before -pron- get involve -pron- be even more archaic than -pron- be   and -pron- think -pron- m hop to do that with this industry as well      c   -pron- want to build on -pron- legacy      l   -pron- want to build -pron- own legacy   -pron- want to build the cool   most amazing   most award win resort not just right now but 20 year from now   30 year from now   -pron- still want -pron- to be the coolest operator out there      c   but do -pron- get the sense that -pron- be supportive of what -pron- be do      l   uh   -pron- think so   again   -pron- be very lucky not to have work in any of -pron- company   -pron- think after school -pron- come back and -pron- join an investment bank during the it bubble and -pron- learn about corporate finance and to be honest to get melco to this stage involve a lot of financial engineering   not just borrow from the bank   every single equity transaction derivative -pron- can think of   -pron- ve do and so get melco to this stage be a result of that      c   -pron- father be go to step down as chairman of sjm next month and there be concern of a power struggle within -pron- company   now -pron- know -pron- re young   but any lesson there for -pron- in term of succession planning that -pron- can take away for -pron- and melco      l   of course -pron- s very important to have succession planning and -pron- think -pron- s even easy if -pron- have only 1 child like -pron-      c   not 17      l   not 17   but at the same time -pron- think for -pron- -pron- come from north america so -pron- m very open minded because melco be a list company   the parent company be list in hong kong   the main operating company be list on nasdaq and so -pron- ne to look out for all of -pron- shareholder and stakeholder include -pron- bank   bondholder and -pron- need to operate like a genuine company with the high regard for corporate governance and the good practice so -pron- think for -pron- if -pron- daughter doesn t want to get into the business -pron- s totally fine with -pron-   -pron- think one day there ll be a management team   a young   hungry   innovative and creative management team that can continue to take this thing forward as long as -pron- have the philosophy that -pron- ve build so -pron- m pretty open minded      c   the power struggle and feud within -pron- family make big headline in 2011   be -pron- sad thing become so public      l   well   -pron- stay out of -pron-   -pron- think that whenever there s so many people involved and -pron- view be that       c   must be use to -pron-      l   no   -pron- m not use to -pron- because -pron- stay out of -pron-   on top of be very open minded -pron- m kind of a straight shooter and so -pron- consider bicker just a waste of time and crappy   so -pron- totally stay out of that and -pron- m glad -pron- do      c   -pron- be 41 year old   -pron- leave investment banking to get into gaming in 2003   operate under the license of -pron- father before -pron- get -pron- very own in 2006   -pron- now run 3 casino resort here in macau   one in the philippines   and with gaming operation also in cyprus   how would -pron- describe -pron- leadership and -pron- management style   what be lawrence ho like as the boss   115139     l   well   -pron- like to think that -pron- want to surround -pron- with the good people   people that be much smart than -pron- and -pron- think that s an important component because -pron- consider -pron- hardwork   -pron- think -pron- have an eye for certain style but other than that -pron- like to bring on more and more people that can supplement the team and have good and new idea and that s what the company be build upon   -pron- want the great idea   the great concept and then -pron- ne to execute -pron- properly   so -pron- would say -pron- enable -pron- colleague and -pron- work as a team   -pron- enable -pron- colleague to challenge -pron- and do thing that be super cool      c   and finally   since -pron- last interview -pron- more than 10 year ago   -pron- re still as energetic as ever   so just between -pron- and -pron-   how many casino resort would -pron- be have in say 10 year under melco      l   -pron- don t know   for -pron- what s more important be quality over quantity so -pron- think 1 japan or 1 macau trump 10 koreas or 10 cambodias   for -pron- -pron- s always go to be   -pron- don t have the most hotel room but -pron- have the good hotel room   -pron- have the most attraction but

       " 'export liquefy natural gas from the u s   be one of the most surprising development of this past decade   -pron- hasn t be long since this country be consider spending billion on natural gas import facility   and the export business be nonexistent just a few year ago   today   the u s   be a top five lng producer and will likely take the no   3 spot this year      cheniere energy   nysemkt   lng     which pioneer lng export in the u s    currently can export around 18 million ton per year of lng   with plan to double that production over the next decade   cheniere be by far the large player in the u s   and the business have perform good than analyst could have expect   for investor look to get into the lng business   however   there be another stock worth consider   tellurian   nasdaq   tell     here s why investor may want to get in on the ground floor on this upstart lng export business      image source   getty images      tellurian s management team write cheniere s playbook   now -pron- s call an audible     tellurian and cheniere be more closely tie than merely be in the same business   charif souki   tellurian s founder   also happen to be the founder of cheniere energy   souki be oust as cheniere s ceo at the end of 2015 because activist investor carl icahn think the company s growth plan be too ambitious     for what -pron- s worth   -pron- s still follow much of soukis   original plan      one of the aspect that make tellurian compelling be that -pron- have a management team in place that s already go through the entire development process to take a blueprint to a fully operational facility   which include securing contract   financing   and pass all of the regulatory hurdle along the way   several of the company s top management team   include souki as chairman and ceo meg gentile   come from cheniere   and -pron- also pick up several executive from bg group after -pron- acquisition by royal dutch shell       what s more   tellurian s management can improve on the process   the technology for the liquefaction process have advance   so -pron- per ton of production cost be much low than what cheniere have at -pron- start   also   now that souki and -pron- team have prove the lng export concept   -pron- will be much easy to find partner in the project to help pay for construction   cheniere have to rely heavily on debt and some creative financial engineering to find all the funding for -pron- facility   which have leave the company with a considerable debt load   tellurian   on the other hand   be look to sell to partner a 58   equity portion in the facility   which will help to pay for construction and significantly reduce -pron- reliance on debt      another aspect where tellurian be change the approach cheniere take be to become a more integrated company   in addition to own and operate the lng export facility   -pron- intend to construct several long haul natural gas pipeline to move gas from several shale basin   -pron- have also acquire some acreage in the haynesville shale region and want to produce some of -pron- gas need to cut down on feedstock cost   this add some risk and complexity to the business   but if -pron- can use these asset well   -pron- could markedly boost tellurian s profit      by the number     from an operation standpoint   both cheniere and tellurian expect to grow considerably over the next several year   what matter to investor   though   be how much value -pron- can get from these stock   base on -pron- stock price   tellurian look like -pron- have much more upside potential      one of the attractive aspect of investing in cheniere be that -pron- have somewhat predictable revenue and cash flow    more than 80   of -pron- production capacity be sell under fix fee   take or pay contract   so -pron- can reasonably project cheniere s future result as new production capacity become operational   base on management s estimate   the company will be able to generate between   7 25 and   8 25 per share in cash flow   at today s stock price   that be a price to cash flow range of 7 5 to 8 9      that s actually pretty cheap   but tellurian s stock look even more attractive   -pron- projection for cash flow be a bit more variable because -pron- win t have these same price contract protection   instead   -pron- estimate range vary considerably base on the future of natural gas price    if -pron- take the conservative range in -pron- investor presentation   though   investor can expect between   3 66 to   8 55 per share in cash flow   that give tellurian a price to cash flow range of 1 0 to 2 3      tellurian be a much more risky stock because -pron- entire business be still on paper and -pron- s await regulatory approval and signing up equity partner   if -pron- can realize -pron- business plan   then -pron- stock look incredibly cheap even under -pron- most conservative projection      tell datum by ychart       risky   but investor could be reward richly     when invest in growth stock   there be a great assumption of risk because of the uncertainty   tellurian s business definitely look uncertain today   but one thing investor can feel good about be that -pron- management team have a huge stake in -pron- success   -pron- management and board of director own 43   of share   french oil giant total have a 19   stake in -pron- as well   with that much skin in the game   investor can rest assure that -pron- interest be deeply align with those of management      consider how close tellurian be to -pron-

residual market in the americas where -pron- be improve -pron- fleet cost per unit to down 3   to down 7    for the additional guidance -pron- provide   -pron- refer -pron- to -pron- earning release

strategic growth opportunity   underpin all of this   -pron- be invest in new technology   mobility solution and way to improve -pron- customer   experience      with that   larry and -pron- d be happy to take some question      question    answer              operator      operator instruction   -pron- first question today be come from chris woronka from deutsche bank   -pron- line be now live      chris woronka     deutsche bank     analyst     hey   good morning   guy   -pron- be hop maybe -pron- d talk a little bit about the opportunity -pron- see on the delivery front use -pron- fleet   -pron- know -pron- still have the budget truck fleet and -pron- ve do some acquisition overseas   can -pron- talk about how big of an opportunity that can be for -pron-      larry de shon     chief executive officer     hi   chris   -pron- s larry   -pron- think -pron- s actually go to be a pretty significant opportunity for -pron- since -pron- re go forward   as -pron- can see   -pron- re develop a lot of other use case and new partnership to take advantage of -pron- fleet   particularly -pron- connected car fleet   -pron- have a fetch pilot go on with budget truck   which allow people to rent truck seamlessly in a self service mode      -pron- have in a few location for the pilot test   but -pron- s an indication of how different use case be develop out there   particularly for this last mile delivery as well   so as -pron- look at some of the partner that -pron- re work with and other that -pron- re discuss opportunity with   -pron- do think that there s a potential for significant amount of business in the future as -pron- relate to this kind of delivery activity both on the car side   as well as the truck side      chris woronka     deutsche bank     analyst     ok   that s helpful   and just as a follow up   as -pron- look at the different possibility for capital allocation between   -pron- gues share repurchase   deleverag   acquisition and kind of reinvest in the business or growth initiative   how do -pron- look at those different bucket right now   what would make -pron- potentially pivot toward one or the other      john north     chief financial officer     hey   -pron- s john   good morning   -pron- think -pron- philosophy with capital allocation have be pretty consistent   -pron- s a balanced approach      over the past four year   -pron- ve split -pron- capital allocation between capex or investment in the business   -pron- buy back a significant amount of stock   like almost   1 5 billion worth   and then -pron- ve do a number of acquisition   especially internationally and then also pick up a number of -pron- licensee in the americas   so -pron- re capitalist at heart      -pron- re look for the good return at all time and that s where -pron- re go to direct the capital   so -pron- would say that -pron- continue to be in flux   -pron- would also point out that this morning   -pron- increase -pron- share repurchase authorization by   100 million   -pron- now have over   250 million available to repurchase share and -pron- re prepared to come in and buy stock if -pron- think that s the high return or if there s a compelling acquisition   -pron- ll look at that      but -pron- think first and foremost   -pron- re go to continue to invest in the business   and these mobility use case   -pron- think be just really the tip of the iceberg to get start here      operator     thank -pron-   -pron- next question today be come from brian johnson from barclays   -pron- line be now live      jason stuhldreher     barclays     analyst     hi   this be jason stuhldreher on for brian   just a quick question around the guidance   so visavis the top line guidance -pron- reiterate   as -pron- lower the rpd outlook in the americas   -pron- be just wonder   be there any other offset either in international or maybe that -pron- re see in volume that maybe wasn t imply in those other revise metric that may cause an offset to revenue   allow -pron- to reiterate the range   or should -pron- just assume maybe the midpoint of that range may be a little low      john north     chief financial officer     yeah   this be john again   and good morning   -pron- think -pron- re comfortable that -pron- re within the range   maybe   -pron- gues to -pron- point   -pron- don t know that -pron- re go to call out anything else specifically   -pron- think the two area that -pron- think be probably worth adjust be just a slight decrease in rpd and then   obviously   a pretty significant change in -pron- per unit fleet cost per month base on what -pron- ve see so far year to date      so -pron- think     -pron- still think -pron- re go to fall revenue range -pron- give within -pron- own estimate or model work   if -pron- want to bring down -pron- revenue estimate   -pron- think that s -pron- call   but -pron- think -pron- don t see anything that indicate -pron- re go to have a big departure from where -pron- expect to be overall      jason stuhldreher     barclays     analyst     ok   thank -pron-   and just one follow up   maybe a long term question   -pron- think -pron- be a very exciting announcement around the otonomo partnership      should investor be think in the next   call -pron- two or three year   any material incremental benefit from revenue through that data monetization effort   and if so   be there any way to sort of frame up what the potential revenue benefit could be      larry de shon     chief executive officer     jason   -pron- think -pron- s early stage yet with -pron- otonomo partnership   -pron- be get revenue stream come in now from -pron-   -pron- have sign with     -pron- have sign with a couple of customer that ll be use -pron- datum   obviously   as -pron- connected car fleet grow   that will provide even more datum opportunity into otonomo that -pron- can aggregate with other car datum that -pron- re get from other supplier of this datum      so -pron- do believe that there be a lot of upside potential here   how much at this point   -pron- m not really willing to go out and say   but -pron- think -pron- just ne to let the partnership develop   get the car connect and then   over time   -pron- can see the demand for that kind of datum   but -pron- do think -pron- will be     over time   -pron- should be fairly significant      jason stuhldreher     barclays     analyst     understood   thank -pron-      operator     thank -pron-   -pron- next question today be come from derek glynn from consumer edge research   -pron- line be now live      derek glynn     consumer edge research     analyst     yeah   good morning   and thank for take -pron- question   can -pron- provide additional detail around the uber partnership   be there any material difference with the lyft partnership program   and -pron- expectation for how large that ride hail fleet and the expect contribution from that program in 2019 be look out to 2020      larry de shon     chief executive officer     yeah   this be larry   first of all   -pron- d say that now that -pron- ve have some experience with lyft and -pron- ve get over 3 000 car now out on rent   -pron- re pleased with what -pron- re see   so -pron- have take some time to take a look at the profitability of this business and how mileage and damage and so forth have be perform   -pron- do use connect fleet so that -pron- do monitor the fleet   and -pron- have the ability to make sure that -pron- can monitor the mileage on -pron- and so forth to protect the asset value of the fleet      -pron- only do weekly rental   so -pron- have an opportunity to review -pron- at the end of every week   so -pron- think -pron- put -pron- in the right kind of parameter around -pron- to make sure that -pron- be pleased with the result of -pron-   and so far   -pron- re pleased with the result   -pron- want to continue grow -pron- and -pron- re planning to continue to grow with lyft in a number of airport     or a number of city location now with lyft and -pron- ll continue to grow with -pron-      and the uber business will be     -pron- think will follow pretty much the same parameter   the same guideline as -pron- go forward   so over time   between both of -pron-   -pron- don t see any reason why this wouldn t be in the ten of thousand of car over time as -pron- continue to roll out the network for both company      derek glynn     consumer edge research     analyst     ok   great   and then as -pron- relate to the recent   400 million note offer and the subsequent redemption of a portion of those 2023   john   can -pron- just speak to the rationale behind those transaction   and then also how be -pron- think about the ideal leverage ratio for the company go forward      john north     chief financial officer     thank   this be john   -pron- think what -pron- see be a nice opportunity to take out a piece of the   675 million note that be due in 2023   one of the thing that be most   -pron- think excite for -pron- when -pron- join the company about four month ago be that -pron- really have a very well think out capital structure and -pron- think the company s historically do a really good job of manage maturity and make sure that -pron- re not sort of sit there with a gun to -pron- head   have to do something      and -pron- think this be a great example of -pron- opportunistically pay about a quarter point more on that   400 million relative to what -pron- retire by get an additional four year of duration   which -pron- think be a pretty good trade   particularly where kind of rate environment be today   -pron- think the other thing -pron- accomplish be -pron- really knock down the size of that one tower   so   675 million   -pron- think frankly   be from david calabria and -pron- perspective   a little bit high than -pron- would like   -pron- would like to keep -pron- just a little bit more manageable   and so this give -pron- the ability to put   400 million out there and then leave the   275 million   which be a much more manageable size for the 2023      so overall   -pron- think the execution be good and -pron- be just able to take advantage of that little blip in kind of the rate environment and put together a pretty compelling transaction   and -pron- ve be wait about a month or so to get that do and when rate finally come in   -pron- launch in at the same day close   so -pron- be all pretty easy   in term of -pron- question around leverage   -pron- ve talk a lot about -pron- range be kind of three to four time      -pron- think this go back to one of the early question around capital allocation   which be just where do -pron- think be the good utilization of money that s come in   and the beauty of this be the cash flow and how much cash -pron- regenerate   a reminder   -pron- re go to do between   250 million and   300 million of free cash flow this year   so -pron- ve get a wonderful annuity stream   and -pron- re go to put -pron- to work where -pron- think be good      -pron- think -pron- re really comfortable at 3 8 time lever   but if -pron- think there s good opportunity for -pron- to potentially bring that down a bit vis a vis other stuff   -pron- ll look at -pron-   but -pron- have to say -pron- m pretty excited about -pron- opportunity to invest internally and then also the success -pron- re start to see with the connected car with the partnership with lyft and uber   with otonomo   and then some of the mileage optimization and thing that -pron- re do there   so -pron- can accelerate any of that      -pron- think   -pron- re willing to do so   and -pron- probably notice -pron- bump up -pron- range for capital allocation in term of capex this year just a little bit to kind of reflect some of that   so -pron- think that s how -pron- re think about the world      operator     thank -pron-   -pron- next question today be come from david tamberrino from goldman sachs   -pron- line be now live      david tamberrino     goldman sachs     analyst     yeah   great   good morning   larry   good morning   john   utilization look like -pron- improve pretty nicely year over year in americas and then also within international segment      how much of that can be drive by just improve turning of the vehicle and operation versus the connected car fleet      larry de shon     chief executive officer     -pron- s a     this be larry de shon   david   -pron- s a combination of a lot of initiative that be go on in the business to kind of drive utilization   first of all   there s a number of use case that -pron- re develop in the business that really go for a long length of rental type of transaction   so -pron- s a revenue per transaction play versus the revenue per day play      and as those use case grow in number   that will continue to help utilization   also the connected car fleet be help -pron- shave time off of     idle time off of the fleet   and that s     whether -pron- s just an overdue     get an overdue back faster   a couple day faster than -pron- normally would if -pron- wasn t connect -pron- think really matter   also -pron- alternative channel be really help -pron- shorten the length of time to sale for -pron- fleet   and the team have be really aggressive in manage the utilization this past first quarter and into the summer and take advantage of opportunity to     whether -pron- s in the retail market to sell car where -pron- think -pron- s the right thing to do b',\n",

cortisol      -pron- hypothesis   which originate with investigator at the university of chicago   be that add a cortisol modulator to androgyne deprivation therapy will block this tumor escape route   investigator at the university of chicago be lead two control phase 2 trial test this hypothesis   one examine korlym plus xtandi and the other relacorilant plus xtandi      -pron- be conduct a dose find trial of -pron- proprietary selective cortisol modulator   exacorilant   formerly cort 125281   combine with xtandi   to treat patient with castration resistant prostate cancer and -pron- ll evaluate datum from that trial as well as datum from the trial be lead by the university of chicago investigator once -pron- be available to develop the appropriate next step for -pron- development program      -pron- will conclude with the discussion of -pron- program in metabolic disease   preclinical and clinical datum have show that cortisol modulation may play a role in treat two serious widespread metabolic disorder for which there be no fda approve treatment   weight gain cause by anti psychotic medication   and non alcoholic steatohepatitis or nash      let -pron- provide some background   million of patient rely on anti psychotic medication to treat illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder   these medication be effective   but -pron- side effect   include weight gain   hyperglycemia   and hyperlipidemia shorten the life of patient   most of whom die from cardiovascular disease      in april   -pron- begin dose healthy subject in a phase 1b trial to test whether miracorilant attenuate the weight gain cause by the commonly prescribe anti psychotic medication olanzapine   -pron- model this trial on placebo control study -pron- conduct in which

-pron- from advance as a treatment for common disorder   miracorilant be a viable candidate because -pron- be a selective cortisol modulator   like relacorilant   -pron- have no progesterone receptor activity      in -pron- current trial   60 healthy subject receive olanzapine and either miracorilant or placebo for two week   although the trial s primary endpoint be change in weight   -pron- have a more fundamental goal   this be the first study of miracorilant s potential pharmacodynamic activity   -pron- result in animal study be very powerful   -pron- know from -pron- phase 1 trial that miracorilant be well tolerate   -pron- objective for this study be to begin to learn about -pron- metabolic property and people   -pron- will have result later this year      later this year   -pron- will also begin a double blind placebo control phase 2 trial in patient with recent anti psychotic induce weight gain   in 2020 after -pron- program to optimize miracorilant s formulation be complete

relacorilant s phase 3 nda enable grace trial continue to enroll patient   separately   -pron- will begin a placebo control double blind trial in patient with less severe cushing s syndrome later this year      -pron- continue to make important advance in -pron- oncology program   -pron- present striking datum from a phase 1 2 trial at asco this year   the datum show durable disease control in patient with metastatic   ovarian   and pancreatic cancer well beyond what be expect from a population that receive multiple prior line of therapy   include prior use of taxane   -pron- re actively enrol subject in a 180 patient control phase 2 trial of relacorilant plus abraxane in ovarian cancer   -pron- expect to begin a phase 3 trial in patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer later this

program achieve an important milestone   -pron- lead compound   miracorilant   be be test for the attenuation of anti psychotic induce weight gain in healthy subject and two phase 2 trial in anti psychotic induce weight gain will be conduct   one expect to begin later this year and another one to begin in 2020   -pron- also expect to start a phase 2 trial of miracorilant to treat patient with nash next year      -pron- ll stop here for question      question and answer      operator     if -pron- d like to ask a question   please signal by press   1 on -pron- telephone keypad   if -pron- re use a speakerphone   please make sure -pron- mute function be turn off to allow -pron- signal to reach -pron- equipment   again   press   1 to pose a question   -pron- ll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for question      -pron- ll take -pron- first question from charles duncan of cantor fitzgerald   please go ahead      pete stavropoulos     cantor fitzgerald     analyst     hi   this be pete stavropoulos on for charles duncan   congratulation on the quarter   -pron- have a couple of question about the grace study   how be enrollment go and could -pron- give a sense in term of timing for potential outcome in phase 3   this be in light of some -pron- competitor and one of -pron- competitor have difficulty in enrollment and have delay topline datum for -pron- program      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     okay   -pron- d like to reintroduce everyone to andreas grauer   who s -pron- chief medical officer   andreas   why don t -pron- take the question      andreas grauer     chief medical officer     hi   so   just to give -pron- a quick update on how grace be go   -pron- have a very good investigator leave europe just recently with a lot of enthusiasm of all the involved investigator   -pron- may remember in -pron- phase 2 program   the majority of patient be recruit in europe and only a small percentage in the us      so   at the moment   -pron- re start off all these site in europe   as -pron- may know   july and august be relatively slow month for enrollment   but -pron- goal be to make the fall extremely productive in term of enrollment and to complete enrollment hopefully by the end of this year   the study design   -pron- s a six month open label phase and a three month randomized control phase   so   the last patient out should then be nine month later      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     and pete   of course   andreas speak that as a one time former european   -pron- re work very hard to get all the site up in europe   there be great enthusiasm at that meeting   the fall will really tell -pron- where -pron- be in enrollment and -pron- would be able to give -pron- a good sense of that   -pron- re confident that the phase 2 result have prompt investigator to join the trial who may not otherwise have and -pron- re confident -pron- ll be able to use the medicine successfully in patient   nothing change from the last call and -pron- ll give -pron- an update as -pron- have more datum in the fall      pete stavropoulos     cantor fitzgerald     analyst     -pron- have another question about the new study   the double blind   placebo control     do -pron- a have a similar design to grace   where -pron- have the lead in period   patient experience clinically meaningful benefit and then move on to the randomized control phase   what kind of outcome be -pron- look at   be -pron- the same burden of disease and pricing      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     -pron- ll point -pron- to andreas again   there be a lot in that   but andreas   go for -pron-      andreas grauer     chief medical officer     let -pron- go through that step by step   so   first of all   no   -pron- will not be the same design as in grace because -pron- will be a placebo control study right from the start   so   -pron- will respectively randomize the patient into two group   one will receive the active treatment   relacorilant   and the other half will receive placebo   -pron- be plan for a study duration of six month   -pron- will be do this study as a placebo control study because the burden of disease in this particular population be somewhat low than in the population that -pron- re enrol in grace   these be patient with adrenal tumor and the hormonal change be more or less pronounced but there be significant datum point to the fact that these patient suffer serious long term consequence if this disease remain untreated   that s why -pron- feel -pron- s important to treat these patient in this trial      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     pete   -pron- ll just add     -pron- really think this meeting in europe be a seminal investigator meet   as someone who attend -pron- -pron- can tell -pron- that the single period of great energy be for this study   literature over the last six year have really indicate that these patient that watch and wait never get good   but -pron- s never be study in a rigorous way   although -pron- think -pron- s a big advantage to actually do the study   although there be certainly a number of case report of individual with this variant of cushing s syndrome improve   this be really the first time a placebo study have be attempt that really specify this group   -pron- think -pron- s very vengeful for the field as -pron- go forward      pete stavropoulos     cantor fitzgerald     analyst     thank   do -pron- have any sort of timeline to datum      andreas grauer     chief medical officer     -pron- re in the process of finalize the protocol   the submission across the us and europe have to happen and -pron- ne to get approval for this trial   -pron- will use pretty much the same center that -pron- be use currently for grace that will give -pron- economy of scale that will make the approval and start up for this study faster   -pron- expect an enrollment period of approximately six to nine month in this trial   that give -pron- the driver for the study and when -pron- re go to be able to see result here      operator     -pron- ll now take -pron- next question from tazeen ahmad from bank of america   please go ahead      tazeen ahmad     bank of america merrill lynch     analyst     hi   good afternoon   thank for take -pron- question   -pron- just want to ask -pron- about -pron- thought on recent rhetoric come from both party about price control   -pron- guy do take a 9   price increase today on korlym and -pron- kind of want to ask -pron- -pron- thought process on how -pron- decide -pron- want to take a price increase   -pron- seem like -pron- last one be some time ago   as -pron- move into an election year   how be -pron- think about -pron- internal modeling about what kind of price sensitivity the market may have   of course take into account that -pron- re a rare disease marketer   how should -pron-   as -pron- model out -pron- assumption for sale   think about any contribution from price      charlie robb     chief financial officer     hey   tazeen   thank for the question   this be charlie   obviously   this be the first price increase -pron- ve take in about 18 19 month   -pron- s something -pron- look at every quarter try to judge what the appropriate price be   -pron- ve sort of get a twofold view   one be that -pron- obligation be to develop -pron- compound as efficiently and expeditiously as -pron- can with the revenue that -pron- br in and make sure that patient be deny korlym on the basis of financial need   -pron- ve live up to -pron- part of that social contract      -pron- also be always careful to make sure -pron- be never the tall nail on the board   -pron- have remain and will remain   -pron- think   well within the middle of the hear   as to exactly what will shake out politically   -pron- re not sure but -pron- think -pron- feel confident in the increase -pron- ve take   -pron- feel like -pron- re justified and -pron- re live up to -pron- side of the bargain in this economy   that s really all the guidance -pron- can give -pron- on that point      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     -pron- would just reemphasize that this be not a once in a while topic   -pron- think about -pron- all the time   evaluate -pron- every quarter and -pron- feel like this really be an appropriate time to take a price increase   -pron- just want to point out to the group that there be no price increase in the second quarter   the price increase do begin today and so   the second quarter result be absent any price increase at all      tazeen ahmad     bank of america merrill lynch     analyst     great   thank for all the color   maybe keep in line that think   -pron- have reiterate -pron- guidance for the full year   -pron- didn t seem to -pron- -pron- would need that much growth in each quarter to get to the middle of -pron- guidance range   now that -pron- have take this 9   price increase   why not increase the range on the bottom end a little bit      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     so   first of all   -pron- guidance and -pron- pricing decision really be independent matter   one of the thing -pron- don t take into account when set -pron- price be what -pron- d like -pron- revenue to be   -pron- determine -pron- guidance base on -pron- good estimate for the year and then -pron- determine pricing on -pron- own merit on -pron- quarterly basis   for -pron-   -pron- re separate consideration      -pron- didn t narrow -pron- guidance this quarter because -pron- think -pron- revenue will still fall within that range   but as the year go on and -pron- get close to the end   guidance   like price   be something -pron- will look at and decide if -pron- s appropriate to lower -pron- on the next call   -pron- ll see      operator     -pron- ll take -pron- next question from adam walsh with stifel   please go ahead      neil carnahan     stifel nicolaus     analyst     hi   guy   -pron- s neil carnahan on for adam   on miracorilant   can -pron- tell -pron- about the development path -pron- guy be think about   -pron- re go to launch a placebo control phase 2 study later this year   another in 2020 for anti psychotic induce weight gain   can -pron- expand on these   have -pron- guy give think to design   have that design finalize enrollment size   any detail -pron- can share there      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     -pron- m go to punch -pron- to andreas for that question      andreas grauer     chief medical officer     as joe tell -pron-   miracorilant have a very interesting pharmacology   the molecule be not very easy to formulate and -pron- re optimize the formulation   so   -pron- re start with one phase 2 trial in which -pron- think -pron- can study the medication in -pron- current format and that be a trial in patient that have recently gain weight on antipsychotic medication   the expect trial size here be approximately 100 patient and -pron- will be placebo control   one to one randomization   active versus placebo   -pron- re expect an enrollment period of approximately one year and to start that trial in the last quarter of this year      the next trial -pron- will start once -pron- have a good   more suitable formulation for those and -pron- re planning to start a second trial in anti psychotic induce weight gain and -pron- re also plan to start the trial in nash      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     let -pron- elaborate a little bit   this have be a very   very potent molecule in animal model on a per kilogram basis   even significantly more potent than mifepristone   which -pron- be very potent   so   -pron- ve allude to this formulation issue   -pron- now have 100 milligram tablet which really seem to work very well   but -pron- think the dose be likely to fall in the 600 900 milligram basis   what -pron- d really like to be able to do be create a tablet that have more milligram in -pron- so people don t have to take 600 900 milligram a day   -pron- re hard at work at that   -pron- have lot of resource attend to -pron-   -pron- think that be really a solvable problem   that s the issue      in the meantime   the way that -pron- describe -pron-   -pron- really be go to continue to accumulate datum   -pron- s very important that -pron- can really show the datum -pron- ve see in animal do translate to people   the first study that -pron- will see be the healthy subject study that -pron- ve talk about   that will be later this year   then the next study after that be in the patient that have recently gain weight on anti psychotic medication   both of those will be control double blind study   -pron- think -pron- ll get some indication of whether or not the medication activity be real and substantial      operator     -pron- ll now take -pron- next question from matt kaplan of ladenburg thalmann   please go ahead      matthew kaplan     ladenburg thalmann     analyst     to follow up on adam s question about miracorilant and specifically the phase 1b study   be that go to be the next data readout that -pron- have   can -pron- give -pron- more color in term of what -pron- should be look for in the phase 1b study   specifically the metabolic effect -pron- should be look for      joseph belanoff     chief executive officer     matt   let -pron- back up a little bit just so that     -pron- know -pron- re very familiar with the program but other may not be quite as familiar   this be a compound which in model of anti psychotic induce weight gain among other thing produce very potent result   those study be actually publish and anyone can go read about -pron-      this be the first study -pron- ve do in people
