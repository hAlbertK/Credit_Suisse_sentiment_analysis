micro computer inc senior vp cfo 11 yes -pron- think if -pron- look at the cash that -pron- have now certainly -pron- have harvest some of that from the balance sheet -pron- think roughly out of that 259 million working capital harvesting roughly about 70 million of that and -pron- know that -pron- re go to need that soon -pron- continue to grow again so -pron- know this be a question that come up last time -pron- be just go to continue to plow forward in term of understanding what -pron- work capital need be as growth return -pron- feel pretty strongly about that nehal sushil chokshi maxim group llc research division md 12 okay and then that s great that -pron- submit the fiscal year 18 financial for finalization by -pron- auditor can -pron- confirm that the submit financial be within the previously announce revenue and eps range kevin s bauer super micro computer inc senior vp cfo 13 yes no -pron- m not go to be able to confirm that that s not something to address at this moment operator 14 operator instruction -pron- next question come from jon lopez of vertical group jonathan doherty lopez the vertical trading group llc research division research analyst 15 -pron- just have a couple of clarification first do -pron- guy give -pron- or would -pron- give -pron- the number the server system number please or the percentage of the business that be server system charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 16 yes -pron- say in the script in charles script that 81 be service -pron- m sorry server jonathan doherty lopez the vertical trading group llc research division research analyst 17 81 okay 81 -pron- m sorry -pron- miss that -pron- second question -pron- don t really have all the move piece -pron- gues but -pron- look like opex be kind of flattish sequentially a -pron- m wonder if can -pron- confirm that and then b just any thought on how that ought to trend obviously -pron- guy know that the environment s not terrific right now so -pron- m wonder if -pron- guy be do anything proactive for the balance of the year on the opex side kevin s bauer super micro computer inc senior vp cfo 18 so -pron- be relatively flattish -pron- talk about the 2 component that wiggle -pron- think as -pron- look forward -pron- will -pron- have confidence in a long term business inaudible to investment -pron- don t think that -pron- ll see large increase in opex so far in line with what -pron- think need to be investment for the future jonathan doherty lopez the vertical trading group llc research division research analyst 19 get -pron- okay helpful -pron- be this apply to one of the comment -pron- guy make -pron- apologize -pron- can t remember who make -pron- but some version of the cascade lake pacing be ahead of prior generation -pron- m wonder if -pron- could just flush that out a little bit maybe not entirely consistent with what -pron- re pick up elsewhere so -pron- m wonder if -pron- s specific to -pron- mix -pron- sku so if -pron- guy just could spend a second on that and then in do so -pron- know -pron- re not go to give guidance so -pron- m not ask for -pron- but as -pron- think about trend towards the end of the calendar year any thought on just seasonality and how applicable that may be give the environment and give what -pron- re see with the cascade lake base project charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 20 -pron- mean as -pron- know -pron- be technology db company so when there be new technology -pron- have a chance to grow datum give the macroeconomic wherewithal -pron- will be choppy in the come month so -pron- try to be conservative however -pron- cascade lake -pron- think inaudible very well especially the new platform include bigtwin there have be continue grow and inaudible -pron- start resource save -pron- start to gain more and more attraction and like -pron- just mention the recent result launch another 2 new datum form include inaudible and hyper inaudible so although -pron- s in early stage now -pron- believe in inaudible and those new technology -pron- have inaudible growth inaudible jonathan doherty lopez the vertical trading group llc research division research analyst 21 and if -pron- could just follow up on that -pron- make a good point which be -pron- guy have put a lot of skus out around cascade lake -pron- appear as though significantly more on a relative basis than -pron- peer have and so -pron- m wonder do -pron- would -pron- view cascade lake as perhaps an opportunity for maybe like disproportionate share gain with this cycle like i e be -pron- competitor perhaps less focus on this excuse -pron- on this iteration of or this portion of the intel platform than -pron- guy be charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 22 yes as -pron- know there be lot of technology kind of just available include -pron- just mention edsff and samsung na1 those product line continue to gain market share although -pron- be pretty new technology but -pron- see a big credential in near term either late this year or early next year be where the big change would be and as to cascade lake -pron- see -pron- be a big room to grow operator 23 -pron- next question come from mehdi hosseini of susquehanna financial group david ryzhik susquehanna financial group lllp research division associate 24 david ryzhik for mehdi again just back to gross margin -pron- gues move forward with low component price should -pron- expect that to serve as a tailwind to gross margin move forward kevin s bauer super micro computer inc senior vp cfo 25 well -pron- think the reduction in component price obviously have slow down so -pron- ve go through a pretty steep ramp as -pron- go through the last few quarter -pron- re not go to have that same kind of ramp on a go forward basis so -pron- think in term of -pron- help -pron- as one of the component in term of improve -pron- gross margin -pron- don t see that that s go to be a sustained uplift because those price be the reduction in those price be flatten out david ryzhik susquehanna financial group lllp research division associate 26 have that alter -pron- decision make around inventory management as far as memory be -pron- strategically add component give the flattening out charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 27 -pron- would have to say -pron- have be conservative in this dram and then price drop period so -pron- will continue to monitor very closely david ryzhik susquehanna financial group lllp research division associate 28 great and then just question on storage would -pron- be able to share the growth in nexgen storage versus traditional storage and overall storage charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 29 yes indeed especially -pron- new storage form factor nf1 be basically -pron- edsff -pron- have plenty of a new platform and -pron- have inaudible of -pron- endorse probably in near future and midterm david ryzhik susquehanna financial group lllp research division associate 30 and just lastly charles would love to get -pron- take on what -pron- re see in hyper scale or internet datum center -pron- know that s part of the g 2000 but would love to hear what trend -pron- re see amongst -pron- customer there charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 31 not inaudible what -pron- share with -pron- -pron- continue to grow -pron- economical scale in taiwan and also in u s a so when -pron- scale continue to grow -pron- will be more competitive to beat those large scale datum center and -pron- be prepared enough operator 32 -pron- next question come from nehal chokshi of maxim group nehal sushil chokshi maxim group llc research division md 33 so -pron- think -pron- state that -pron- expect to have gain market share during the quarter so what do -pron- think the market uptake there because intel datum center group revenue be down 10 year over year about but -pron- enterprise and government be down 31 year over year and -pron- just say that -pron- guy be up 12 year over year on the enterprise side so just maybe give -pron- a sense as far as what do -pron- think the market do and what portion of that intel datum center group metric or probably actually most relevant for gauge super micro performance perry g hayes super micro computer inc svp of ir 34 nehal -pron- s -pron- don t always track out 1 to 1 with what -pron- group do again if -pron- look at what -pron- be track to and want -pron- to be hyper scale et cetera and what that that s not a major part of -pron- business although -pron- have some customer there the enterprise would be a separate sort of group there charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 35 but -pron- would just say overall -pron- mean -pron- sell economical scale continue to grow -pron- will be more aggressive in both enterprise and super scale datum center operator 36 -pron- appear at this time that -pron- have no further question -pron- d like to turn the call back over to mr liang for any additional or close comment charles liang super micro computer inc founder president ceo chairman of the board 37 thank -pron- for join -pron- today and have a great day operator 38 thank -pron- lady and gentleman that do co,positive

be collectively include in the number of pay customer as one customer seasonality revenue -pron- generally do not experience substantial seasonal fluctuation in demand for -pron- service and -pron- revenue remain relatively stable throughout each quarter however as -pron- customer be predominately business and use -pron- service mostly on business day -pron- quarterly revenue be affect by the number of business day in a quarter with the exception of -pron- service that represent stand ready performance obligation such as subscription to access -pron- curriculum vitae cv database which be satisfied over the period of subscription include weekend and holiday story continue public holiday in russia predominantly fall during the first quarter of each year which result in low business activity in that quarter accordingly -pron- first quarter revenue be typically slightly low than in the other quarter for example -pron- first quarter revenue in -pron- russia segment in 2017 and 2018 be 21 1 and 20 9 respectively and -pron- first half of the year revenue in -pron- russia segment in 2017 and 2018 be 45 5 and 45 6 respectively of total russia segment revenue for the year the number of business day in a quarter may also be affect by calendar layout in a specific year also the government of russia decide on an annual basis how public holiday that occur on weekend will be reallocate to business day throughout the year as a requirement of the labor code of russia as a result the number of business day in a quarter may be different in each year while the total number of business day in the year would remain the same this affect -pron- revenue in a particular quarter and year on year revenue growth rate for that quarter if the allocation of business day in the comparable period be different in addition when a calendar layout in a specific year provide for several consecutive holiday or small number of business day between holiday or holiday adjacent to weekend hr manager of -pron- customer may take short vacation further contribute to the decrease in business activity in these period the follow table illustrate the number of business day by quarter for the year 2017 to 2019 in 2019 the total number of working day be the same as in 2018 but there be 1 business day more 2 business day less and 1 business day more in the first quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively and the same number of business day in the fourth quarter number of business day as of total business day per year 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 first quarter 57 56 57 23 1 22 7 23 1 second quarter 59 61 61 23 9 24 7 24 7 third quarter 66 65 65 26 7 26 3 26 3 fourth quarter 65 65 64 26 3 26 3 25 9 year 247 247 247 100 0 100 0 100 0 therefore in the second quarter of 2019 -pron- see a negative impact on -pron- revenue and revenue growth rate from few business day as compare to the second quarter of 2018 which have offset the positive impact from additional business day -pron- see in the first quarter of 2019 also due to the particular calendar layout in this year -pron- revenue in the period from may 6 2019 to may 8 2019 be unusually low as these day be adjacent to holiday and hr manager of -pron- customer could take short vacation which contribute to lower customer activity on -pron- platform operate cost and expense exclusive of depreciation and amortization -pron- operating cost and expense exclusive of depreciation and amortization consist primarily of personnel and marketing expense personnel and marketing expense cumulatively account for 77 4 and 78 9 of -pron- total operate cost and expense exclusive of depreciation and amortization for the year end december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively most of -pron- marketing and personnel expense be fix and not directly tie to -pron- revenue marketing expense be more volatile in term of allocation to quarter which be affect by -pron- decision on how -pron- realize -pron- strategy in a particular year which can differ from year to year therefore total marketing expense as a percentage of revenue for a particular quarter may not be fully representative of the whole year personnel expense be relatively stable over the year however -pron- be also affect by other dynamic such as -pron- hire decision cost and expense such as share base compensation or foreign exchange gain or loss can be significantly concentrate in a particular quarter second quarter segment external expense in -pron- russia segment in 2017 and 2018 be 22 7 and 24 0 respectively of total russia segment external expense for the year net income and adjust ebitda even though -pron- revenue remain relatively stable throughout each quarter seasonal revenue fluctuation describe above affect -pron- net income as a result of revenue seasonality -pron- profitability in first quarter be usually low than in other quarter and for the full year because -pron- expense as a percentage of revenue be usually high in first quarter due to low revenue for example -pron- adjust ebitda margin be 34 6 for the first quarter of 2018 and 41 9 for the six month end june 30 2018 compare to 46 7 for the full year 2018 -pron- profitability be also affect by -pron- decision on timing of expense as describe above contract liability -pron- contract liability be affect by the annual subscription renewal cycle in -pron- key accounts customer segment a substantial number of -pron- key accounts renew -pron- subscription in the first quarter and prepay -pron- in the fourth quarter of a previous year as per -pron- normal payment term as a result -pron- receive substantial prepayment from -pron- customer in the fourth quarter which cause consequential increase in -pron- contract liability at the end of that quarter for example -pron- contract liability as of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 be 1 607 million 1 548 million 1 553 million and 2 073 million respectively net cash generate from operate activity -pron- net cash generate from operate activity be affect by seasonal fluctuation of business activity as explain in revenue and by substantial prepayment from -pron- customer see contract liability as well as by -pron- decision in regard to timing of expense see operating expense exclusive of depreciation and amortization and to a less extent by payment term provide to -pron- by -pron- large supplier such as tv advertising agency and other net work capital -pron- net working capital be primarily affect by change in -pron- contract liability as discuss above as -pron- contract liability be usually high in the fourth quarter -pron- net work capital be usually low in the fourth quarter for example -pron- net work capital of march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 2018 be 2 044 million 2 048 million 2 036 million and 2 623 million respectively second quarter 2019 result -pron- revenue be 1 902 million for the

be hop maybe -pron- d talk a little bit about the opportunity -pron- see on the delivery front use -pron- fleet -pron- know -pron- still have the budget truck fleet and -pron- ve do some acquisition overseas can -pron- talk about how big of an opportunity that can be for -pron- larry de shon chief executive officer hi chris -pron- s larry -pron- think -pron- s actually go to be a pretty significant opportunity for -pron- since -pron- re go forward as -pron- can see -pron- re develop a lot of other use case and new partnership to take advantage of -pron- fleet particularly -pron- connected car fleet -pron- have a fetch pilot go on with budget truck which allow people to rent truck seamlessly in a self service mode -pron- have in a few location for the pilot test but -pron- s an indication of how different use case be develop out there particularly for this last mile delivery as well so as -pron- look at some of the partner that -pron- re work with and other that -pron- re discuss opportunity with -pron- do think that there s a potential for significant amount of business in the future as -pron- relate to this kind of delivery activity both on the car side as well as the truck side chris woronka deutsche bank analyst ok that s helpful and just as a follow up as -pron- look at the different possibility for capital allocation between -pron- gues share repurchase deleverag acquisition and kind of reinvest in the business or growth initiative how do -pron- look at those different bucket right now what would make -pron- potentially pivot toward one or the other john north chief financial officer hey -pron- s john good morning -pron- think -pron- philosophy with capital allocation have be pretty consistent -pron- s a balanced approach over the past four year -pron- ve split -pron- capital allocation between capex or investment in the business -pron- buy back a significant amount of stock like almost 1 5 billion worth and then -pron- ve do a number of acquisition especially internationally and then also pick up a number of -pron- licensee in the americas so -pron- re capitalist at heart -pron- re look for the good return at all time and that s where -pron- re go to direct the capital so -pron- would say that -pron- continue to be in flux -pron- would also point out that this morning -pron- increase -pron- share repurchase authorization by 100 million -pron- now have over 250 million available to repurchase share and -pron- re prepared to come in and buy stock if -pron- think that s the high return or if there s a compelling acquisition -pron- ll look at that but -pron- think first and foremost -pron- re go to continue to invest in the business and these mobility use case -pron- think be just really the tip of the iceberg to get start here operator thank -pron- -pron- next question today be come from brian johnson from barclays -pron- line be now live jason stuhldreher barclays analyst hi this be jason stuhldreher on for brian just a quick question around the guidance so visavis the top line guidance -pron- reiterate as -pron- lower the rpd outlook in the americas -pron- be just wonder be there any other offset either in international or maybe that -pron- re see in volume that maybe wasn t imply in those other revise metric that may cause an offset to revenue allow -pron- to reiterate the range or should -pron- just assume maybe the midpoint of that range may be a little low john north chief financial officer yeah this be john again and good morning -pron- think -pron- re comfortable that -pron- re within the range maybe -pron- gues to -pron- point -pron- don t know that -pron- re go to call out anything else specifically -pron- think the two area that -pron- think be probably worth adjust be just a slight decrease in rpd and then obviously a pretty significant change in -pron- per unit fleet cost per month base on what -pron- ve see so far year to date so -pron- think -pron- still think -pron- re go to fall revenue range -pron- give within -pron- own estimate or model work if -pron- want to bring down -pron- revenue estimate -pron- think that s -pron- call but -pron- think -pron- don t see anything that indicate -pron- re go to have a big departure from where -pron- expect to be overall jason stuhldreher barclays analyst ok thank -pron- and just one follow up maybe a long term question -pron- think -pron- be a very exciting announcement around the otonomo partnership should investor be think in the next call -pron- two or three year any material incremental benefit from revenue through that data monetization effort and if so be there any way to sort of frame up what the potential revenue benefit could be larry de shon chief executive officer jason -pron- think -pron- s early stage yet with -pron- otonomo partnership -pron- be get revenue stream come in now from -pron- -pron- have sign with -pron- have sign with a couple of customer that ll be use -pron- datum obviously as -pron- connected car fleet grow that will provide even more datum opportunity into otonomo that -pron- can aggregate with other car datum that -pron- re get from other supplier of this datum so -pron- do believe that there be a lot of upside potential here how much at this point -pron- m not really willing to go out and say but -pron- think -pron- just ne to let the partnership develop get the car connect and then over time -pron- can see the demand for that kind of datum but -pron- do think -pron- will be over time -pron- should be fairly significant jason stuhldreher barclays analyst understood thank -pron- operator thank -pron- -pron- next question today be come from derek glynn from consumer edge research -pron- line be now live derek glynn consumer edge research analyst yeah good morning and thank for take -pron- question can -pron- provide additional detail around the uber partnership be there any material difference with the lyft partnership program and -pron- expectation for how large that ride hail fleet and the expect contribution from that program in 2019 be look out to 2020 larry de shon chief executive officer yeah this be larry first of all -pron- d say that now that -pron- ve have some experience with lyft and -pron- ve get over 3 000 car now out on rent -pron- re pleased with what -pron- re see so -pron- have take some time to take a look at the profitability of this business and how mileage and damage and so forth have be perform -pron- do use connect fleet so that -pron- do monitor the fleet and -pron- have the ability to make sure that -pron- can monitor the mileage on -pron- and so forth to protect the asset value of the fleet -pron- only do weekly rental so -pron- have an opportunity to review -pron- at the end of every week so -pron- think -pron- put -pron- in the right kind of parameter around -pron- to make sure that -pron- be pleased with the result of -pron- and so far -pron- re pleased with the result -pron- want to continue grow -pron- and -pron- re planning to continue to grow with lyft in a number of airport or a number of city location now with lyft and -pron- ll continue to grow with -pron- and the uber business will be -pron- think will follow pretty much the same parameter the same guideline as -pron- go forward so over time between both of -pron- -pron- don t see any reason why this wouldn t be in the ten of thousand of car over time as -pron- continue to roll out the network for both company derek glynn consumer edge research analyst ok great and then as -pron- relate to the recent 400 million note offer and the subsequent redemption of a portion of those 2023 john can -pron- just speak to the rationale behind those transaction and then also how be -pron- think about the ideal leverage ratio for the company go forward john north chief financial officer thank this be john -pron- think what -pron- see be a nice opportunity to take out a piece of the 675 million note that be due in 2023 one of the thing that be most -pron- think excite for -pron- when -pron- join the company about four month ago be that -pron- really have a very well think out capital structure and -pron- think the company s historically do a really good job of manage maturity and make sure that -pron- re not sort of sit there with a gun to -pron- head have to do something and -pron- think this be a great example of -pron- opportunistically pay about a quarter point more on that 400 million relative to what -pron- retire by get an additional four year of duration which -pron- think be a pretty good trade particularly where kind of rate environment be today -pron- think the other thing -pron- accomplish be -pron- really knock down the size of that one tower so 675 million -pron- think frankly be from david calabria and -pron- perspective a little bit high than -pron- would like -pron- would like to keep -pron- just a little bit more manageable and so this give -pron- the ability to put 400 million out there and then leave the 275 million which be a much more manageable size for the 2023 so overall -pron- think the execution be good and -pron- be just able to take advantage of that little blip in kind of the rate environment and put together a pretty compelling transaction and -pron- ve be wait about a month or so to get that do and when rate finally come in -pron- launch in at the same day close so -pron- be all pretty easy in term of -pron- question around leverage -pron- ve talk a lot about -pron- range be kind of three to four time -pron- think this go back to one of the early question around capital allocation which be just where do -pron- think be the good utilization of money that s come in and the beauty of this be the cash flow and how much cash -pron- regenerate a reminder -pron- re go to do between 250 million and 300 million of free cash flow this year so -pron- ve get a wonderful annuity stream and -pron- re go to put -pron- to work where -pron- think be good -pron- think -pron- re really comfortable at 3 8 time lever but if -pron- think there s good opportunity for -pron- to potentially bring that down a bit vis a vis other stuff -pron- ll look at -pron- but -pron- have to say -pron- m pretty excited about -pron- opportunity to invest internally and then also the success -pron- re start to see with the connected car with the partnership with lyft and uber with otonomo and then some of the mileage optimization and thing that -pron- re do there so -pron- can accelerate any of that -pron- think -pron- re willing to do so and -pron- probably notice -pron- bump up -pron- range for capital allocation in term of capex this year just a little bit to kind of reflect some of that so -pron- think that s how -pron- re think about the world operator thank -pron- -pron- next question today be come from david tamberrino from goldman sachs -pron- line be now live david tamberrino goldman sachs analyst yeah great good morning larry good morning john utilization look like -pron- improve pretty nicely year over year in americas and then also within international segment how much of that can be drive by just improve turning of the vehicle and operation versus the connected car fleet larry de shon chief executive officer -pron- s a this be larry de shon david -pron- s a combination of a lot of initiative that be go on in the business to kind of drive utilization first of all there s a number of use case that -pron- re develop in the business that really go for a long length of rental type of transaction so -pron- s a revenue per transaction play versus the revenue per day play and as those use case grow in number that will continue to help utilization also the connected car fleet be help -pron- shave time off of idle time off of the fleet and that s whether -pron- s just an overdue get an overdue back faster a couple day faster than -pron- normally would if -pron- wasn t connect -pron- think really matter

current capex reduction be due to slow customer activity versus efficiency john c nicholson chief operate officer yeah good question this be john nicholson so -pron- first question -pron- do think -pron- re in the early stage of -pron- some of -pron- be as -pron- mention on the call around just -pron- strategy of execution and a good bit of -pron- as well as also in just utilize the infrastructure -pron- have right if -pron- look at something like mustang that s a very well think out infrastructure development alongside -pron- sponsor and so -pron- re certainly see the benefit of the forethought there right -pron- think -pron- ll continue to do that some of -pron- in addition as -pron- see in the permian be utilize the facility infrastructure that -pron- have connect those central facility will allow -pron- to use the capacity that -pron- ve instal to date to the good of -pron- ability what be the second question spiro michael dounis credit suisse analyst just in term of of how much the current capex reduction be maybe a portion to slow down customer activity versus efficiency gain john c nicholson chief operate officer sure some of -pron- certainly due to change in timing -pron- don t want to characterize -pron- as a slowdown more of a shift of timing of when thing be occur but the good portion of -pron- -pron- would say 60 to 70 be efficiency gain that -pron- expect to continue into 2020 spiro michael dounis credit suisse analyst okay that s helpful on the 4 million credit issue to noble be that anticipate in -pron- guidance and should -pron- expect that to continue throughout the year or be -pron- really just 2q impact tom christensen interim chief financial officer and chief accounting officer yeah effectively -pron- ll end up see that mvc with

that spare capacity in some way or just have to sort of sit empty for now and then just as a follow on to that be there any sort of cash flow impact or just really just volumetric john c nicholson chief operate officer yeah so this be john nicholson again -pron- have a match -pron- third party partner have a match -pron- have to kind of match the noble volume off of the rosetta acreage to a certain degree late last year and early this year as the infrastructure get tighten in the basin -pron- over deliver relative to that match and build up a bank in the back half of this year start kind of in the second quarter -pron- have some additional pipe come on line and -pron- be able move those volume off of -pron- system onto other system and thus -pron- re under deliver and -pron- expect that match to kick back in kind of november december of this year that capacity be unused so to speak -pron- could use -pron- if -pron- so choose if -pron- have a customer that want to walk up and use that space -pron- do have and do have an impact to -pron- back half of the year guidance -pron- do not anticipate in -pron- original 2019 guidance the decline in -pron- partner volume spiro michael

through on -pron- strategic review -pron- m not really able to comment any further on -pron- at this point barrett blaschke mufg securities analyst well -pron- actually set -pron- up for -pron- next question which be any additional clarity -pron- can give -pron- the reuters piece -pron- think put bit of a ceiling on the stock price the last quarter which be the uncertainty around that strategic review and noble s intent for the midstream entity any additional clarity -pron- can give -pron- there on sort of what the plan be or should -pron- just be read this as -pron- guy be constantly review and -pron- s just a normal process or be this a special review terry r gerhart chief executive officer and director no -pron- s not an ongoing process -pron- s a process that -pron- re work through and -pron- remain a priority for noble -pron- don t think -pron- re go to talk any more about the detail until that process be complete -pron- think what s drive -pron- be that the noble ex franchise be very valuable and -pron- re not see the value reflect neither in the noble stock or -pron- recognize -pron- s certainly not be reflect in the noble ex unit price but -pron- do remain a priority for noble -pron- re -pron- hard and in due course and when the time be appropriate -pron- will come forward with -pron- finding and how -pron- re go to proceed barrett blaschke mufg securities analyst okay -pron- mean -pron- s part of the reason -pron- re not realize value on the stock price though ironically relate to the lack of clarity around this review process terry r gerhart chief executive

what kind of contract be these cost of service contract -pron- don t think -pron- be but if -pron- could just remind -pron- john c nicholson chief operate officer yeah dennis this be john nicholson again no -pron- have fix fee contract so in theory if the cost saving do not impact the customer or benefit the customer if -pron- will -pron- mean obviously if -pron- can reduce -pron- cost that should make -pron- more competitive as -pron- pursue thing which be always a benefit right because want to earn good return and so -pron- improve -pron- return and should make -pron- more competitive as -pron- pursue business organic business dennis paul coleman bank of america merrill lynch analyst get -pron- and john -pron- mention in -pron- comment a kind of enhance contracting strategy can -pron- expand on that a little bit john c nicholson chief operate officer yeah -pron- m not go to get into too much of the detail of -pron- contract but -pron- s really partner with some of -pron- big

third party customer and the dj -pron- re able to commit to long cycle of work and more continuous work which give -pron- kind of preferred pricing in addition to that -pron- ve make a few change that share risk differently through the contract which benefit -pron- as well dennis paul coleman bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay ok that s helpful and then terry if -pron- could -pron- know -pron- s difficult to comment on the outcome of the parent process but be possible that at some point be one of the outcome that -pron- just come out and say -pron- re do with the process and because valuation that -pron- just discuss -pron- re just go to leave thing the way -pron- be be there no action one of the option terry r gerhart chief executive officer and director -pron- d say that would

move into a position where -pron- can truly put the pro at the center of the home to provide industry lead whole home product and service thank -pron- and now -pron- ll turn -pron- over to michael to open up q a michael mercieca vice president investor relations -pron- first question be from ian zaffino from oppenheimer ian zaffino oppenheimer analyst thank -pron- very much can -pron- guy just walk through the cadence of the margin improvement in the back half of the year -pron- call that adt what s the actual margin dilution that s cause really look to ultimately mitigate that to and also as -pron- product mix exchange away from adt to more third party what s the impact on margin there thank mike nefkens president and chief executive officer this be mike and -pron- ll start and then probably hand -pron- off to joe here so yes so if -pron- take a look at the second half of the year the big step up be go to be on growth -pron- ll be do about 100 million more in q4 than -pron- do in q1 that be very typical for -pron- -pron- s what -pron- do last year and -pron- s what -pron- do the year before as well so that s step one and -pron- re confident that s as -pron- move from the cool season to the heating system that be a typical seasonality that -pron- see in this business reason for -pron- be there s a high trade sale versus oem sale the trade sale be high margin sale and the oem contract number so that always help -pron- and the other be if -pron- take a look at -pron- security business and -pron- security business this year and -pron- ve be pretty clear about this with the launch of the new platform as -pron- start -pron- s down about eight point of margin from where the last platform be at the end of -pron- cycle which be pretty pretty typical -pron- will as volume of ramp up -pron- ll be get a couple of point back there toward the end of the year as well so the real margin improvement be go to be high trade sale in the second quarter versus oem sale which have high margin high heating -pron- heating product typically have high margin as well as -pron- re sell more gas valve and other type product and then the third be go to be some improvement that -pron- re go to see on the security margin from where -pron- currently be joe ragan chief financial officer yes ian this be joe in addition to that -pron- ll remember that -pron- have call out 10 million of sg a saving that -pron- re go to have that ll primarily be in q4 but the other thing -pron- ask an important question on cadence if -pron- recall in q2 and q3 those be -pron- primary quarter for investment in -pron- new product that -pron- re bring out -pron- don t know if -pron- remember that but if -pron- look at the margin profile q1 2 3 to 4 those investment actually be be make in two and three and have the big impact so -pron- ll see a large an increase in gross margin and ebitda margin in q4 base on the business item that mike bring up and the cost item that ll be low in q4 ian zaffino oppenheimer analyst ok and then just touch on the sort of second hand market over the slide -pron- have pro security grow 2 to 4 and then diy grow 10 plus what be -pron- customer tell -pron- about what professional instal market be do and how -pron- s really fare against maybe some of the new entrant on the diy side be -pron- a real competitive threat or be pro security able to continue to grow like this thanks mike nefkens president and chief executive officer yes so as -pron- say in -pron- prepared remark -pron- really don t play in the diy sector -pron- ve get a couple entry level product that be typically kind of hook product to get people to move into the pro side so -pron- -pron- focus be on the pro security piece -pron- believe what -pron- re do from a market perspective and the new product that -pron- re launching be go to be true market make product and go to be much simple for the end user to use -pron- re hop and -pron- re see business model change now from long term commitment contract commitment for pro security to short which -pron- think be go to really prop up the pro market so -pron- view on that be -pron- want to push that pro security market -pron- re grow faster than market now and -pron- job be to make sure that with the dealer and the partner that -pron- have that -pron- re provide -pron- world class product so that -pron- can compete and truly show a high value in the pro product versus the diy product as -pron- know ian -pron- call the diy product awareness product those product be more for if -pron- want to see -pron- dog run around the home -pron- want to know if someone s at the door those kind of thing the pro product be true monitoring in the home professional monitoring so two very different thing for -pron- ian zaffino oppenheimer analyst ok thank -pron- very much for the call question answer operator thank -pron- operator instruction jeff kessler imperial capital analyst this be jeff kessler at imperial capital with regard to non adt business in the pro market what be the medium and some of the small but maybe let s shift into the medium regional company ask for as -pron- begin to change -pron- product line and advance -pron- in the fourth quarter what be -pron- ask for that be different or additive to what -pron- have now to keep -pron- to keep -pron- value proposition up and high than -pron- may have to call off the new competition mike nefkens president and chief executive officer thank jeff this be mike here -pron- ll answer that so yes so look at security -pron- will be roll out -pron- new pro series platform to the general market in q4 so that in 2020 -pron- ll be roll that out in europe so -pron- have launch -pron- with -pron- large customer and -pron- will be roll -pron- out to general market in q4 and then into europe next year the difference be on what this product do versus the previous generation of product -pron- be a fully modular product mean that -pron- will eliminate the number of truck roll that -pron- dealer ne to make as technology increase as technology change so the good example of that be as cellular technology change as -pron- go from a 4 g to 5 g -pron- win t have to roll a truck anymore -pron- ll be able to send a card straight to -pron- consumer and the consumer can just plug -pron- right into the panel so versus in the past -pron- d actually have to go and replace the panel also the overall cost of the product be much cheap and -pron- be go to give -pron- dealer a competitive advantage versus some of the old technology out there so -pron- re really -pron- simplify installation -pron- s easy for train the installer and much more interactive much good web interface and phone interface and -pron- s really future proof a lot of the radio sunset that -pron- ve see out there in the past so that s the big difference and that s why the large dealer in the u s have go 100 with -pron- and -pron- large customer as well be really bet on -pron- product as -pron- go to really change -pron- profile of -pron- -pron- business jeff kessler imperial capital analyst ok a follow up question on adi -pron- be -pron- have really only one competitor in size in the security side -pron- m wonder if -pron- plan for adi also include any level of comfort give that -pron- know that there s a different distribution there be different channel that comfort both the heating and air conditioning be sell into nevertheless be there a possibility for adi to begin to get into that business as well mike nefkens president and chief executive officer yes so look at -pron- adi business right now -pron- adi business focus as -pron- say on low voltage security -pron- re also -pron- big growth area outside of that be av right now so professional a v that s an area -pron- re push really hard in so also the third item be enterprise connectivity if -pron- take a look at the connected home and the smart home what -pron- re really about be make the smart home simple so where -pron- adi team if -pron- re able to sell a connected thermostat any of the other connected product -pron- will do that so -pron- plan jeff be that -pron- will be sell connected product in the area of air water security and the behind the wall stuff that -pron- call energy but -pron- wouldn t see -pron- sell a lot of nonconnected product in the comfort space so that s the way -pron- re push that team and -pron- re see a pretty good uptick there already jeff kessler imperial capital analyst do the margin mix change at all mike nefkens president and chief executive officer -pron- know what as -pron- know -pron- s very product centric -pron- depend on the actual product -pron- so there be some opportunity there -pron- have task that team with find 200 basis point of margin improvement over the next two year so rob and team be all over that part of that will be exactly what -pron- say through expand deep into connected product jeff kessler imperial capital analyst great thank -pron- very much appreciate -pron- michael mercieca vice president investor relations john lovallo from bank of america merrill lynch john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guy thank -pron- for take -pron- question -pron- m just try to get a good handle here on some of the number so maybe -pron- can start with just a commentary around cost control if -pron- look at 2q adjust operating profit -pron- mean -pron- be below -pron- model and -pron- seem like -pron- may have be below what -pron- initial thought for last quarter and -pron- appear to be some volume some mix and some investment spending gross profit -pron- be about 20 million low than -pron- have expect and -pron- seem like ebitda in the quarter be support by 22 million or so of low legal claim and spinoff cost so -pron- gues the question be twofold one do -pron- anticipate the benefit from these legal and spinoff cost continue and two outside of that where be the cost save opportunity set -pron- guy think will manifest in the back half here joe ragan chief financial officer john this be joe -pron- would expect that -pron- have continue saving on the sg a side -pron- have several program under way to drive the 10 million attainment this year and the 50 million run rate improvement for 2020 and -pron- be drive across the cost and the company overhead as well as look at gross margin improvement as well and supply chain so there be multiple opportunity that -pron- re work currently so -pron- would expect continue sg a improvement as -pron- take cost out of that structure and -pron- should see some improvement on the gross margin line as well john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok ok and maybe just go to slide 7 on the ebitda walk and look at the market moderation bucket there appear to have be a little bit of cushion in -pron- perhaps and if -pron- think about look -pron- mean -pron- re bullish on the new construction cycle and repair remodel as well but -pron- m just curious what happen in the quarter that allow -pron- to become 10 million more positive on that bucket because if -pron- look at housing start -pron- weren t particularly strong joe ragan chief financial officer -pron- didn t really move from -pron- original number of 1 2 million housing start so as -pron- look at that -pron- hasn t move very much and -pron- bring some conservatism into the bridge there just because -pron- didn t have good visibility and as -pron- know 100 000 decline in housing start equal 7 million of ebitda so that hasn t happen yet there s be no change so -pron- think -pron- make sense to actually just cut that in half mike nefkens president and chief executive officer yes and john this be mike here -pron- view on that be -pron- get through half the year so the way -pron- have the market moderation really model this -pron- really feel 10 million in the first half and 10 million in the second so get through half the year -pron- feel pretty good about that and really didn t see any moderation headwind so -pron- ve keep the additional 10 million in for the second half john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank -pron- michael mercieca vice president investor relations -pron- ll hand -pron- back over to president and ceo mike nefkens for closing mike nefkens president and chief executive officer great guy so listen thank -pron- for join the call -pron- really appreciate -pron- a lot of great question as always and -pron- as -pron- say in -pron- prepared remark -pron- have a solid q2 there truly be momentum build right now the investment program that -pron- -pron- ve drive this year -pron- accelerate a lot of -pron- investment from 2020 into the year so that -pron- could launch some of these new product -pron- have prefer to at the end of the year that s all move in the right direction -pron- m really excited to get those out to market -pron- really feel there s some true market maker in there in all area of -pron- business and -pron- s all about execution -pron- ve show in q1 and q2 that -pron- can execute -pron- commitment be to continue that trend go forward and -pron- look forward to -pron- know -pron- m meet many of -pron- here over the next two day so thank -pron- for that also a quick call out -pron- be at the nyse today -pron- ve be ask to actually open the market today so -pron- ll be up on the stand ring the bell and hopefully -pron- can get great momentum here into the second half of the year thank -pron- for attend the call and look forward to talk to -pron- next time operator operator

outlook jim s career span 21 year with consolidated rail corporation conrail 17 year with the rail engineering firm zeta tech associates 7 year with the state of illinois department of transportation in chicago urban good movement research and two year study what to do with the seven bankrupt and unrecognizable northeast railroad at the federal agency usra now primarily a teacher and writer jim like to focus on contrarian aspect of the railroad industry today freight railroading have the opportunity to use two business process to support good customer rail freight service improve safety and generate high return for railroad investor the senior management of north american railroad can integrate the benefit of precision schedule railroading psr with the robust new private communication network and two to four meter accuracy of positive train control ptc technology psr seek to improve return on investment with cargo delivery that be more truck like in term of reliability the initial psr result have be financial in nature shareholder rather than freight customer be receive the early psr benefit in the form of high dividend and increase stock buyback leader like canadian national

double digit range return on balance sheet asset have improve from an 8 to 12 percent range to a 15 percent or high range since psr be implement widely how can precision schedule railroad improve even more the answer be in the roll out of the ptc safety device system the digital age business hypothesis be that psr and ptc can support each other the simple message be that the solution to good precision like scheduling of freight car could be satisfied use the precise gp like feature of ptc for train and crew dispatch when congress pass the federal law that mandate ptc the rail safety improvement act of 2008 -pron- want a train control system design for a minimum level of functionality to prevent train to train collision over speed train derailment incursion into establish work

act of 2015 ptcei act be sign into law to extend the original statutory deadline for full implementation of ptc system from december 31 2015 to december 31 2018 the ptcei act also establish six

and investor that -pron- be committed to both the safety and the improved train and carload movement aspect offer by ptc the holy grail like mission of psr have be to create then monitor and execute rail carload freight movement use a carload trip plan the north american railroad have be chase that goal for about three decade the ptc network of gps constant position reporting of train on the rail industry s private radio network be the miss part leader like bnsf s ceo matt rose and fra s administrator ron batory be on record as define this advanced next generation ptc version two as an accuracy enabler at this time traditional train dispatching efficiency be only about two third to three quarter effective accord to zeta tech associates inc study and other source typical location information when a train be in a long signal block perhaps 10 to more than 20 mile long can be compute with ptc to exact head end and rear end location within six to 12 foot of track that accuracy improvement can increase the number of train move along an otherwise restrict train per day section of railroad the improvement with software advance can be in the 20 percent or good range the possible improved rail yard to rail yard movement and arrival of train at the next yard or customer delivery point can also be improve the target for carload freight deliver to a track side at a plant or warehouse be 85 to 95 percent on time as originally schedule in a rail car s trip plan not exactly truck beat performance however -pron- be a huge improvement for freight customer who must suffer with today s 50 to 60 percent on time percentage what be the key component of ptc that will improve train and carload movement that be different than the use of gp in trucking the critical component of a railroad ptc system be the on board engineer s computer the private communication digital network the central dispatcher s computer console the back office datum warehouse for ptc read write action the way side track switch open or closed sensor operate and the continuous gp read and transmission railroad win t ne to use cell phone or public cell network to communicate in real and continuous time with train writing and testing software to integrate thing like rail car weight from automatic equipment identification aei use radio frequency technology into brake algorithms and test rail car trip plan be go to take some time early technical result may still be six month or more away the technical delivery of good performance may not come from engineer or marketing folk -pron- be more likely that system integrator in the information technology department will create these new digital application package ironically the gps enabler in system come from a federally mandate 10 billion capital investment in ptc this amount equate to a decade or more of railroad typical research and development program which be generally fund at 1 percent of revenue in summary rail freight could see a 20 to 33 percent improvement in on time customer arrival service level this be still not truck like but -pron- be much good than today railroad car cycle time may improve by 20 to 30 percent therefore ptc may cause an unexpected commercial utility of gps datum that could pay huge dividend for railroad and -pron- customer in other word shipper and freight rail car owner could

ship free on board fob magnetite opex estimate reduce to 55 tonne fob capex estimate for a combine project reduce to us 335 million high margin for premium magnetite product 65 fe mr cameron mccall executive chairman of macarthur minerals comment the objective of this revise estimate be to provide shareholder with an update to the stag development of the companys project in light of change to the route to market rail and port infrastructure and new product end user requirement the company be plan to consolidate the magnetite and hematite project to leverage off exist infrastructure that be a result of decreased iron ore production from the adjacent koolyanobbing operation the yilgarn region of western australia and macarthurs projects now offer a major infrastructure and commercial advantage not necessarily available to any new iron ore mining project globally background like most junior resource stock macarthur have face challenge market condition despite such condition macarthur have continue to advance the project throughout the past year and have de risk major project delivery area such as port and rail access this continue focus have position the company to quickly advance the projects and company as the global resource equity market recover macarthur have re evaluate both the hematite and magnetite project in response to current market trend of heavy discounting of low grade iron ore and premium pricing for high grade iron ore additionally macarthur have be prepare to take advantage of the cessation of operation by cleveland cliffs inc which have pave the way for access to both rail and port infrastructure this have be the great impediment to advance the projects into a production phase revise project strategy in february 2011 macarthur release -pron- preliminary economic assessment 2011 pea for the moonshine magnetite project for the production of 10 mtpa of high grade magnetite concentrate press release dated february 7 20111 the 2011 pea outline several logistical and port scenario include slurry transport 110 km to a dewatering plant and rail siding south of the town of menzies similarly in september 2012 macarthur release

yilgarn region of western australia the 2012 pfs outline a wet beneficiation process that would produce a 60 fe sinter fine product feature low level of the deleterious element of silica alumina phosphorus and sulphur the final product would then be road haul 110 kilometer on a public road to a rail siding south of the town of menzies from here the iron fine would be transport along exist rail infrastructure to the port of esperance for export since the release of those study the iron ore market have undergo a dramatic shift where low grade iron ore 60 fe be currently heavily discount while the high grade market include magnetite concentrate be attract premium pricing in response macarthur have revise -pron- strategy to align the projects with current and forecast market condition capital market and available capacity of regional infrastructure the great impediment to development of the moonshine magnetite project envisage by the 2011 pea be the substantial capital cost moreover the plan production exceed current capacity at the port of esperance macarthur have therefore reduce the output of the projects to a modest 3 mtpa and streamlined project infrastructure to reduce capital cost the revise project will see a combined hematite and magnetite operation where the majority of product will be high grade magnetite concentrate supplement by lump direct shipping ore dso the dso fine which be of low value will be process through the grind circuit of the magnetite plant and blend into the magnetite concentrate to achieve a significant grade improvement project logistics and infrastructure the moonshine 2011 pea utilise slurry transport of concentrate and subsequent rail haulage along the menzies rail line whereas the ularring 2012 pfs employ road haulage to the same location along a public road product transport be now envision to be via road haulage 90 km south to the exist rail line follow by rail haulage to the port of esperance whilst slurry transport offer a low operating cost -pron- be capital intensive and require additional water and power demand the original slurry pipeline from the 2011 pea be estimate at a 281 m this have since be remove from the projects in favour of road transport to a rail side 90 km south of the projects macarthur be currently explore opportunity to utilise an exist private haul road if the company can gain access to this infrastructure -pron- will require only 45 km of the 90 km of haul road to be construct which will fast track the development timeline with the exit of cleveland cliffs inc and subsequent reduction in production at the koolyanobbing operation by current owner mineral resources limited there be now capacity on the perth to kalgoorlie rail line this rail line be far superior to the originally propose menzies line and translate into a significant reduction in rail haulage tariff additionally the cessation of cleveland cliffs inc have make available approximately 800 rail wagon which can be acquire at a significantly discount price by macarthur or -pron- preferred rail operator the original 2011 pea also make a capital allowance of a 171 m for product handling and port upgrade macarthur have be work closely with the western australian government and have obtain confirmation that the port of esperance have capacity for at least 6 mtpa through exist infrastructure furthermore the rail car dumper rcd previously own and monopolise by cleveland cliffs inc have become open access for the available capacity that be expect to be at least 6 mtpa these logistical change and access to regional infrastructure greatly improve the projects economic and attractiveness to offtake and fund partner for the first time macarthur have a direct route through a port with little competition for capacity revise cost estimate base on the logistical change describe above macarthur have re evaluate the economic of a combined magnetite and hematite dso operation the key element that have be revise that contribute to substantial cost saving include road haulage along a private haul road 90 km to rail south of the project access to the export infrastructure at the port

disease trajectory -pron- expect that this study will enroll approximately as many patient as the grace trial with half of the participant receive relacorilant and the rest placebo many of the site participate in the grace study will participate in this trial -pron- be important to note that this trial be not a required part of a relacorilant development program -pron- expect to base relacorilant s nda for cushing s syndrome on the result of grace that being say this etiology of cushing s syndrome have not be study extensively and -pron- expect -pron- trial s result to contribute meaningfully to -pron- understanding and treatment -pron- will now turn to -pron- oncology program in tumor that expres glucocorticoid receptor cortisol stimulation suppress the program cell death

receptor which unfortunately correlate with low survival rate -pron- phase 1 and 2 trial of relacorilant plus nab paclitaxel celgene s taxane base drug abraxane test the hypothesis that add a cortisol modulator to a chemotherapeutic regimen would turn down cortisol s anti apoptotic effect and all chemotherapy to achieve -pron- full potential -pron- present datum from this trial at this year s asco

week or long the duration of response in some patient be particularly notable tumor shrinkage two patient with pancreatic disease last long than 50 week a patient with ovarian cancer exhibit tumor shrinkage for 65 week the target lesion in another patient with ovarian cancer disappear completely these be striking result all of these patient have undergo multiple prior line of therapy include treatment with nab paclitaxel or another taxane that any of any of -pron- respond when relacorilant be add to the therapy be surprising -pron- asco poster be available at the investor past event tab of -pron- website -pron- investigator believe as do -pron- that -pron- phase 1 and 2 result justify large more definitive study earlier this year -pron- begin a 180 patient placebo control phase 2 trial of relacorilant plus nab paclitaxel in patient with advanced ovarian cancer in addition -pron- have complete write the protocol for a phase 3 trial of relacorilant plus nab paclitaxel in patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer and will seek fda guidance regard the fast path to approval in that indication -pron- objective be to start this trial by year end the result -pron- ve describe be excite -pron- will quote briefly from the opinion express by the european medicine agency s committee for orphan medicinal products the comp for short when -pron- recommend that relacorilant be designate as an orphan drug for the treatment of pancreatic cancer this be a direct quote relacorilant have the potential to restore tumor sensitivity to taxane therapy this be demonstrate by non clinical and clinical result that be the achievement of durable partial response or disease control in some patient despite previously fail treatment regimen the comp consider that the preliminary clinical datum submit by the sponsor support the claim of significant benefit for the purpose of an initial orphan designation -pron- agree if -pron- can confirm -pron- phase 1 2 finding in subsequent large trial -pron- will constitute a major advance in the treatment of these dire cancer cortisol modulation may treat patient with metastatic prostate cancer by a different mechanism androgyne stimulate growth in tumor of the prostate which be by androgyne deprivation be the standard treatment investigator at the university of chicago and memorial sloan kettering have show that when prostate tumor cell be treat with androgyne deprivation agent such as enzalutamide pfizer s drug xtandi the growth begin to be stimulate by cortisol -pron- hypothesis which originate with investigator at the university of chicago be that add a cortisol modulator to androgyne deprivation therapy will block this tumor escape route investigator at the university of chicago be lead two control phase 2 trial test this hypothesis one examine korlym plus xtandi and the other relacorilant plus xtandi -pron- be conduct a dose find trial of -pron- proprietary selective cortisol modulator exacorilant formerly cort 125281 combine with xtandi to treat patient with castration resistant prostate cancer and -pron- ll evaluate datum from that trial as well as datum from the trial be lead by the university of chicago investigator once -pron- be available to develop the appropriate next step for -pron- development program -pron- will conclude with the discussion of -pron- program in metabolic disease preclinical and clinical datum have show that cortisol modulation may play a role in treat two serious widespread metabolic disorder for which there be no fda approve treatment weight gain cause by anti psychotic medication and non alcoholic steatohepatitis or nash let -pron- provide some background million of patient rely on anti psychotic medication to treat illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder these medication be effective but -pron- side effect include weight gain hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia shorten the life of patient most of whom die from cardiovascular disease in april -pron- begin dose healthy subject in a phase 1b trial to test whether miracorilant attenuate the weight gain cause by the commonly prescribe anti psychotic medication olanzapine -pron- model this trial on placebo control study -pron- conduct in which mifepristone significantly reduce the metabolic side effect of olanzapine and another anti psychotic medication risperidone unfortunately mifepristone s status as the abortion pill prevent -pron- from advance as a treatment for common disorder miracorilant be a viable candidate because -pron- be a selective cortisol modulator like relacorilant -pron- have no progesterone receptor activity in -pron- current trial 60 healthy subject receive olanzapine and either miracorilant or placebo for two week although the trial s primary endpoint be change in weight -pron- have a more fundamental goal this be the first study of miracorilant s potential pharmacodynamic activity -pron- result in animal study be very powerful -pron- know from -pron- phase 1 trial that miracorilant be well tolerate -pron- objective for this study be to begin to learn about -pron- metabolic property and people -pron- will have result later this year later this year -pron- will also begin a double blind placebo control phase 2 trial in patient with recent anti psychotic induce weight gain in 2020 after -pron- program to optimize miracorilant s formulation be complete -pron- will initiate a phase 2 trial and the reversal of long stand anti psychotic induce weight gain now -pron- ll say a few word about nash another serious metabolic disorder that affect million of people in the united states nash be characterize by fatty liver liver inflammation and fibrosis -pron- be a precursor to cirrhosis mifepristone be potent in animal model in these condition and appear to reverse fatty liver disease in patient with cushing s syndrome in animal model with these condition miracorilant be even more potent -pron- expect to initiate a double blind placebo control phase 2 of miracorilant in patient with nash next year to recap -pron- cushing s syndrome business have an excellent quarter -pron- reaffirm -pron- 2019 revenue guidance of 285 million to 315 million for 2019 -pron- be significantly increase the size of -pron- field salesforce which should begin to contribute to -pron- commercial result next year relacorilant s phase 3 nda enable grace trial continue to enroll patient separately -pron- will begin a placebo control double blind trial in patient with less severe cushing s syndrome later this year -pron- continue to make important advance in -pron- oncology program -pron- present striking datum from a phase 1 2 trial at asco this year the datum show durable disease control in patient with metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancer well beyond what be expect from a population that receive multiple prior line of therapy include prior use of taxane -pron- re actively enrol subject in a 180 patient control phase 2 trial of relacorilant plus abraxane in ovarian cancer -pron- expect to begin a phase 3 trial in patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer later this year -pron- trial of exacorilant plus enzalutamide continue to generate datum as do trial be lead by investigator at the university of chicago with korlym and relacorilant -pron- metabolic program achieve an important milestone -pron- lead compound miracorilant be be test for the attenuation of anti psychotic induce weight gain in healthy subject and two phase 2 trial in anti psychotic induce weight gain will be conduct one expect to begin later this year and another one to begin in 2020 -pron- also expect to start a phase 2 trial of miracorilant to treat patient with nash next year -pron- ll stop here for question question and answer operator if -pron- d like to ask a question please signal by press 1 on -pron- telephone keypad if -pron- re use a speakerphone please make sure -pron- mute function be turn off to allow -pron- signal to reach -pron- equipment again press 1 to pose a question -pron- ll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for question -pron- ll take -pron- first question from charles duncan of cantor fitzgerald please go ahead pete stavropoulos cantor fitzgerald analyst hi this be pete stavropoulos on for charles duncan congratulation on the quarter -pron- have a couple of question about the grace study how be enrollment go and could -pron- give a sense in term of timing for potential outcome in phase 3 this be in light of some -pron- competitor and one of -pron- competitor have difficulty in enrollment and have delay topline datum for -pron- program joseph belanoff chief executive officer okay -pron- d like to reintroduce everyone to andreas grauer who s -pron- chief medical officer andreas why don t -pron- take the question andreas grauer chief medical officer hi so just to give -pron- a quick update on how grace be go -pron- have a very good investigator leave europe just recently with a lot of enthusiasm of all the involved investigator -pron- may remember in -pron- phase 2 program the majority of patient be recruit in europe and only a small percentage in the us so at the moment -pron- re start off all these site in europe as -pron- may know july and august be relatively slow month for enrollment but -pron- goal be to make the fall extremely productive in term of enrollment and to complete enrollment hopefully by the end of this year the study design -pron- s a six month open label phase and a three month randomized control phase so the last patient out should then be nine month later joseph belanoff chief executive officer and pete of course andreas speak that as a one time former european -pron- re work very hard to get all the site up in europe there be great enthusiasm at that meeting the fall will really tell -pron- where -pron- be in enrollment and -pron- would be able to give -pron- a good sense of that -pron- re confident that the phase 2 result have prompt investigator to join the trial who may not otherwise have and -pron- re confident -pron- ll be able to use the medicine successfully in patient nothing change from the last call and -pron- ll give -pron- an update as -pron- have more datum in the fall pete stavropoulos cantor fitzgerald analyst -pron- have another question about the new study the double blind placebo control do -pron- a have a similar design to grace where -pron- have the lead in period patient experience clinically meaningful benefit and then move on to the randomized control phase what kind of outcome be -pron- look at be -pron- the same burden of disease and pricing joseph belanoff chief executive officer -pron- ll point -pron- to andreas again there be a lot in that but andreas go for -pron- andreas grauer chief medical officer let -pron- go through that step by step so first of all no -pron- will not be the same design as in grace because -pron- will be a placebo control study right from the start so -pron- will respectively randomize the patient into two group one will receive the active treatment relacorilant and the other half will receive placebo -pron- be plan for a study duration of six month -pron- will be do this study as a placebo control study because the burden of disease in this particular population be somewhat low than in the population that -pron- re enrol in grace these be patient with adrenal tumor and the hormonal change be more or less pronounced but there be significant datum point to the fact that these patient suffer serious long term consequence if this disease remain untreated that s why -pron- feel -pron- s important to treat these patient in this trial joseph belanoff chief executive officer pete -pron- ll just add -pron- really think this meeting in europe be a seminal investigator meet as someone who attend -pron- -pron- can tell -pron- that the single period of great energy be for this study literature over the last six year have really indicate that these patient that watch and wait never get good but -pron- s never be study in a rigorous way although -pron- think -pron- s a big advantage to actually do the study although there be certainly a number of case report of individual with this variant of cushing s syndrome improve this be really the first time a placebo study have be attempt that really specify this group -pron- think -pron- s very vengeful for the field as -pron- go forward pete stavropoulos cantor fitzgerald analyst thank do -pron- have any sort of timeline to datum andreas grauer chief medical officer -pron- re in the process of finalize the protocol the submission across the us and europe have to happen and -pron- ne to get approval for this trial -pron- will use pretty much the same center that -pron- be use currently for grace that will give -pron- economy of scale that will make the approval and start up for this study faster -pron- expect an enrollment period of approximately six to nine month in this trial that give -pron- the driver for the study and when -pron- re go to be able to see result here operator -pron- ll now take -pron- next question from tazeen ahmad from bank of america please go ahead tazeen ahmad bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good afternoon thank for take -pron- question -pron- just want to ask -pron- about -pron- thought on recent rhetoric come from both party about price control -pron- guy do take a 9 price increase today on korlym and -pron- kind of want to ask -pron- -pron- thought process on how -pron- decide -pron- want to take a price increase -pron- seem like -pron- last one be some time ago as -pron- move into an election year how be -pron- think about -pron- internal modeling about what kind of price sensitivity the market may have of course take into account that -pron- re a rare disease marketer how should -pron- as -pron- model out -pron- assumption for sale think about any contribution from price charlie robb chief financial officer hey tazeen thank for the question this be charlie obviously this be the first price increase -pron- ve take in about 18 19 month -pron- s something -pron- look at every quarter try to judge what the appropriate price be -pron- ve sort of get a twofold view one be that -pron- obligation be to develop -pron- compound as efficiently and expeditiously as -pron- can with the revenue that -pron- br in and make sure that patient be deny korlym on the basis of financial need -pron- ve live up to -pron- part of that social contract -pron- also be always careful to make sure -pron- be never the tall nail on the board -pron- have remain and will remain -pron- think well within the middle of the hear as to exactly what will shake out politically -pron- re not sure but -pron- think -pron- feel confident in the increase -pron- ve take -pron- feel like -pron- re justified and -pron- re live up to -pron- side of the bargain in this economy that s really all the guidance -pron- can give -pron- on that point joseph belanoff chief executive officer -pron- would just reemphasize that this be not a once in a while topic -pron- think about -pron- all the time evaluate -pron- every quarter and -pron- feel like this really be an appropriate time to take a price increase -pron- just want to point out to the group that there be no price increase in the second quarter the price increase do begin today and so the second quarter result be absent any price increase at all tazeen ahmad bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank for all the color maybe keep in line that think -pron- have reiterate -pron- guidance for the full year -pron- didn t seem to -pron- -pron- would need that much growth in each quarter to get to the middle of -pron- guidance range now that -pron- have take this 9 price increase why not increase the range on the bottom end a little bit joseph belanoff chief executive officer so first of all -pron- guidance and -pron- pricing decision really be independent matter one of the thing -pron- don t take into account when set -pron- price be what -pron- d like -pron- revenue to be -pron- determine -pron- guidance base on -pron- good estimate for the year and then -pron- determine pricing on -pron- own merit on -pron- quarterly basis for -pron- -pron- re separate consideration -pron- didn t narrow -pron- guidance this quarter because -pron- think -pron- revenue will still fall within that range but as the year go on and -pron- get close to the end guidance like price be something -pron- will look at and decide if -pron- s appropriate to lower -pron- on the next call -pron- ll see operator -pron- ll take -pron- next question from adam walsh with stifel please go ahead neil carnahan stifel nicolaus analyst hi guy -pron- s neil carnahan on for adam on miracorilant can -pron- tell -pron- about the development path -pron- guy be think about -pron- re go to launch a placebo control phase 2 study later this year another in 2020 for anti psychotic induce weight gain can -pron- expand on these have -pron- guy give think to design have that design finalize enrollment size any detail -pron- can share there joseph belanoff chief executive officer -pron- m go to punch -pron- to andreas for that question andreas grauer chief medical officer as joe tell -pron- miracorilant have a very interesting pharmacology the molecule be not very easy to formulate and -pron- re optimize the formulation so -pron- re start with one phase 2 trial in which -pron- think -pron- can study the medication in -pron- current format and that be a trial in patient that have recently gain weight on antipsychotic medication the expect trial size here be approximately 100 patient and -pron- will be placebo control one to one randomization active versus placebo -pron- re expect an enrollment period of approximately one year and to start that trial in the last quarter of this year the next trial -pron- will start once -pron- have a good more suitable formulation for those and -pron- re planning to start a second trial in anti psychotic induce weight gain and -pron- re also plan to start the trial in nash joseph belanoff chief executive officer let -pron- elaborate a little bit this have be a very very potent molecule in animal model on a per kilogram basis even significantly more potent than mifepristone which -pron- be very potent so -pron- ve allude to this formulation issue -pron- now have 100 milligram tablet which really seem to work very well but -pron- think the dose be likely to fall in the 600 900 milligram basis what -pron- d really like to be able to do be create a tablet that have more milligram in -pron- so people don t have to take 600 900 milligram a day -pron- re hard at work at that -pron- have lot of resource attend to -pron- -pron- think that be really a solvable problem that s the issue in the meantime the way that -pron- describe -pron- -pron- really be go to continue to accumulate datum -pron- s very important that -pron- can really show the datum -pron- ve see in animal do translate to people the first study that -pron- will see be the healthy subject study that -pron- ve talk about that will be later this year then the next study after that be in the patient that have recently gain weight on anti psychotic medication both of those will be control double blind study -pron- think -pron- ll get some indication of whether or not the medication activity be real and substantial operator -pron- ll now take -pron- next question from matt kaplan of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead matthew kaplan ladenburg thalmann analyst to follow up on adam s question about miracorilant and specifically the phase 1b study be that go to be the next data readout that -pron- have can -pron- give -pron- more color in term of what -pron- should be look for in the phase 1b study specifically the metabolic effect -pron- should be look for joseph belanoff chief executive officer matt let -pron- back up a little bit just so that -pron- know -pron- re very familiar with the program but other may not be quite as familiar this be a compound which in model of anti psychotic induce weight gain among other thing produce very potent result those study be actually publish and anyone can go read about -pron- this be the first study -pron- ve do in people beyond the phase 1 study that really establish that the dos -pron- have in mind be well tolerate wh,neutral

operator instruction question and answer operator 1 operator instruction the first question come from the line of mr siward ludin of goldman sachs technical difficulty well -pron- believe siward have disconnect from the q a operator instruction yes -pron- have mr siward ludin again from goldman sachs siward ludin goldman sachs group inc research division research analyst 2 so congratulation on a good set of the result -pron- have 3 question here so first on the mobile side could -pron- give more comment on the competitive landscape and specifically why -pron- subscriber decrease q on q so -pron- would appreciate more color on which region do -pron- see this come from and whether what be -pron- plan to reverse this because the sim card registration have be do for a while and -pron- ve seen growth of subscriber into competitor as well and secondly on indihome s arpu what be what be drive the high proportion of dual play be these new customer or old customer downgrade and what effort be -pron- make be -pron- do to make customer upgrade and lastly on -pron- cost bucket could -pron- explain more on why on a q o q basis -pron- cost bucket on personnel expense and g a increase quite a lot and what item be -pron- spend more here harry mozarta zen perusahaan perseroan persero pt telekomunikasi indonesia tbk director of finance cfo director 3 okay harry from telkomsel speak here on the competitive environment especially on the subscriber base that s why -pron- experience a decline of subscriber base in the second quarter of this year basically what -pron- try to do to make the industry become healthy -pron- focu on the renewal base rather than sell sim card so mostly -pron- subscriber be do renewal -pron- closely identify who be -pron- subscriber the sim card and also the email of -pron- subscriber what -pron- see actually -pron- subscriber base quite stable from time to time but -pron- try to focus to increase this quality and the result of this one also -pron- can see actually the revenue be still grow and that that growth be quite convincing -pron- s be actually -pron- focus on increase the quality of subscriber and also the contribution in line with -pron- expectation second and the third question -pron- ask about the why the personnel cost have increase -pron- think this mainly if -pron- addres in the telkomsel side -pron- do a salary adjustment in last year -pron- try to make -pron- salary become attractive and also competitive to the -pron- think market benchmark today encourage -pron- also so those who perform to get a more -pron- think more attractive package this bring -pron- to the adjustment of the -pron- think salary this year that which be in -pron- view -pron- be a betterment for the long run position in term of maintenance and attractive package to the -pron- talented employee on the cost of ga and also the cost of service -pron- s mainly come from when -pron- come to the cost of service because -pron- implement ifrs 9 which require -pron- to do -pron- think some allowance even in the first day of the when -pron- bill the customer actually -pron- re use the same base that -pron- apply previously -pron- with the quality of -pron- collection become high the cost cause to be decline instead of grow but -pron- now implement the ifrs 9 so that cause the cost of service become high but in term of quality of -pron- collection actually improve that s for -pron- third question heri supriadi pt telekomunikasi selular director of finance and director 4 okay on the question about the indihome arpu yes the majority of the new subscriber that -pron- get in the first semester have be mostly the dual play customer so in fact more than 60 of these new client new customer be dual play customer and then on the g a overall on the group level q on q why -pron- increase mostly increase due to the high provision -pron- colleague just mention about the provision relate to the ifrs 9 on mobile but also there be some increase of high provision in -pron- consumer i e indihome segment plus also that in second quarter -pron- always that be the time when -pron- pay bonus to the management siward ludin goldman sachs group inc research division research analyst 5 okay just a small follow up be there exist customer also downgrade to dual play or be -pron- just the new customer that be sign up to dual play heri supriadi pt telekomunikasi selular director of finance and director 6 yes almost all be because of the new dual play customer operator 7 -pron- next question come from the line of kresna hutabarat of mandiri kresna p hutabarat pt mandiri sekuritas research division analyst 8 firstly congratulation to all the member of the bod on the new appointment as management of telkom group and telkomsel and congratulation also on the solid performance in the first half 19 -pron- have one question to telkomsel and another question to telkom group -pron- first question to telkomsel if -pron- look at the read across from the list of telkom s first half result -pron- seem that telkom s effective tower rental rate have decline by 3 to 4 in second quarter 19 so can -pron- just get some update if telkomsel have embark on any rental rate renegotiation program recently and if yes how should -pron- view this rental rate renegotiation opportunity in the context of achieve additional cost saving in the second half of the year and in 2020 that s -pron- first question and -pron- next question be on capex for telkom group so if -pron- look at the capex run rate in first half 19 -pron- s a bit -pron- s look behind capex guidance of 27 of total revenue in full year 19 so should -pron- expect some acceleration in the second half and perhaps could -pron- share some additional color on the capex profile for second half 19 harry mozarta zen perusahaan perseroan persero pt telekomunikasi indonesia tbk director of finance cfo director 9 okay pak kresna harry speak here on the cost of tower -pron- comment actually the explanation -pron- can give -pron- here be actually the rate that -pron- have be actually competitive compare to the market -pron- s be almost similar apply to another operator as well and then why the cost on -pron- also really increase significantly because -pron- already have around 50 000 of site which be in 3 g almost double 98 of population in 4 g now -pron- close to 95 of population -pron- mean actually -pron- re not really add new site just rent some new space in the same site this also limit the increase of cost despite the number of btss increase quite significantly so basically the cost somewhat -pron- can say competitive to the market second -pron- coverage be already very good and so the increase of the tower lease merrily kind of incremental only to the exist cost be -pron- go to see actually the big tower that be go to be renewal after 10 year in 2021 2022 definitely -pron- try to find a solution win win solution with the tower provider if -pron- can let s say make the renewal become earlier so both party go to benefit when -pron- start to have another new 10 year of contract kresna p hutabarat pt mandiri sekuritas research division analyst 10 okay and then on the second question on yes heri supriadi pt telekomunikasi selular director of finance and director 11 on the capex for full year -pron- remain optimistic and remain -pron- guidance 27 capex to revenue actually from every year the first semester -pron- always still lag behind from -pron- full year target in term of capex to revenue target so the and most of the capex item in the second semester be almost the same like what -pron- ve be have in the first semester which be to enhance -pron- broadband coverage as well as obviously capex to enhance -pron- mobile coverage kresna p hutabarat pt mandiri sekuritas research division analyst 12 all right can -pron- just have one follow up question -pron- think historically there seem to be a correlation between capex run rate and also the group o m expense run rate in the past -pron- think between 2012 to 2017 o m expense tend to accelerate when capex intensity pick up but that s not the case this year so could -pron- shed some color on o m expense trajectory go forward -pron- look like this year have be quite slow so yes -pron- just want to get some color on o m expense run rate for the year heri supriadi pt telekomunikasi selular director of finance and director 13 yes the profile of -pron- o m expense growth in first semester be relate to the decline in the it service business so the revenue decline the cost also decline plus also in -pron- enterprise -pron- also experience some decline because -pron- be shift to more profitable segment in term of the hardware or what -pron- call cpe trading because some customer do ask -pron- to provide hardware when -pron- provide -pron- with -pron- enterprise solution so that be also experience some decline in the first semester and those be part of the overall o m so with regard to the trajectory of o m this year -pron- be for total opex overall -pron- be optimistic that the growth of revenue will be big and the growth will be large than the growth of the opex for full year this year so that s why if -pron- remember the guidance from -pron- ceo just now ebitda margin and net income margin be target to be slightly good than 2018 operator 14 -pron- next question come from the line of arthur pineda of citi arthur pineda citigroup inc research division director and head of pan asian telecommunications research 15 several question please firstly can -pron- clarify on the enterprise revenue that be down 11 12 q on q year on year -pron- recall at the start of the year -pron- be guide at high single digit growth outlook here be -pron- still keep that or have that change second question -pron- have be with regard to g a expense that s up nearly 50 q on q -pron- mention there be an ifrs 9 adjustment be that one off or be there any other adjustment to be see and lastly on the mobile side can -pron- get some color on the mobile competition -pron- competitor earlier mention that -pron- re see some escalation happen in the market with unlimited plan be push be -pron- see any such impact on -pron- business heri supriadi pt telekomunikasi selular director of finance and director 16 yes thanks arthur on the enterprise business -pron- be still optimistic that -pron- would get the target of high single digit growth for full year basis this year and -pron- optimism be obviously base on the pipeline project that -pron- re secure since particularly since second quarter of this year so hopefully -pron- will be able to recognize the revenue within the first the second semester of this year so -pron- be pretty much on track with such a target in term of the g a increase the ifrs 9 be the on mobile side well maybe pak harry can shed some light on that harry mozarta zen perusahaan perseroan persero pt telekomunikasi indonesia tbk director of finance cfo director 17 okay on the ifrs 9 when -pron- do implement this year -pron- be go to be one time basically adjustment this year move forward -pron- be suppose to be kind of roll of how much that -pron- ne to accrue base on this new standard base on the -pron- think quite stable quality of collection there be not go to be any kind of surprise move forward this be just a one time adjustment and then -pron- be suppose to be kind of recur one second on the mobile competition subscriber impact on the business again as -pron- mention as also -pron- think stipulate in pak ririek presentation actually -pron- expect actually the number of subscriber of mobile not suppose to be increase base on the -pron- think sim card registration along the time the quality of subscriber become good and then the number -pron- think dual sim card or triple or even more become reduce time to time what -pron- really have see from -pron- side be how be actually the number of active subscriber that and quality subscriber that -pron- have remain intact and remain contribute to -pron- revenue this -pron- do in a very granular level so -pron- ensure that -pron- always give -pron- market share on this one by have this one actually -pron- can increase also -pron- revenue later on -pron- still have opportunity because the legacy continue to decline -pron- mean the portion come from datum revenue become big and big as -pron- close -pron- revenue sale come from legacy become less than 30 this go to give -pron- a good impact from time to time as more -pron- think growth come from data -pron- can capitalize to -pron- top line that s the situation that -pron- do expect -pron- think now with the investment in -pron- operator start quite intense -pron- s be actually everyone focus on how -pron- really increase the quality of -pron- subscriber base as -pron- see also there s no significant movement from -pron- competitor in term of the number of subscriber base as well -pron- do expect with the current situation of the price competition that s quite benign even all -pron- think operator be go to benefit from this -pron- competitor with the low -pron- think inaudible suppose to be first that benefit big than -pron- as -pron- see from the result but -pron- be a healthy condition for -pron- -pron- mean -pron- can continue to lead -pron- think the price adjustment move forward as -pron- also make the price adjustment so -pron- re still -pron- re go to have another room for lead the price adjustment as well arthur pineda citigroup inc research division director and head of pan asian telecommunications research 18 sorry just to clarify on the second question a while ago so the nearly 50 q on q jump in the g a segment inaudible because of some accounting adjustment and -pron- should see that normalize in the subsequent quarter harry mozarta zen perusahaan perseroan persero pt telekomunikasi indonesia tbk director of finance cfo director 19 yes this be go to be normal in the later on one off and then go to be kind of recur become normal standard as -pron- have the cyber quality of collection a good quality of collection this not suppose to be a scary thing heri supriadi pt telekomunikasi selular director of finance and director 20 arthur just to clarify further right the provision the increase in provision amount in second quarter increase do not happen only in mobile but -pron- all see some increase in -pron- consumer i e indihome segment and the thing in indihome do not have anything to do with accounting treatment -pron- s all real kind of real provision right arthur pineda citigroup inc research division director and head of pan asian telecommunications research 21 so for indihome that s a sustainable number okay heri supriadi pt telekomunikasi selular director of finance and director 22 yes operator 23 next question be from the line of ranjan sharma of jpmorgan ranjan sharma jp morgan chase co research division analyst 24 just a couple of question from -pron- side -pron- have hear more news around new regulatory change come into indonesia if -pron- can just comment on if -pron- see any impact whatsoever from imei regulation which the government plan to sign on the 17th of august and also if there be any update on the priority pricing regulation that -pron- speak about earlier this year then the other question that -pron- have be on the mobile side be -pron- see -pron- mean some of -pron- customer have report a strong growth in customer so be -pron- see a return of the
